      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a time of crisis – not only economic crisis but also a crisis of confidence. This crisis of confidence affects all citizens, but especially the youngest, who as a result find it harder to summon the courage and desire to build their own futures.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union has set a challenge to tackle this crisis, which is also a challenge for the EU itself: the great Europe 2020 strategy must genuinely combat this lack of confidence and help us back onto the path towards a better future and a better life.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is precisely why Parliament has put funding for this strategy at the heart of the budget for 2012, starting with its very top priority: higher employment, better employment and quality employment in a Europe that focuses on innovation and research. Hence, we in this Parliament have asked and are asking for greater resources for three key programmes, which are the true engines behind the 2020 strategy: the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP).</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, therefore, what we need is consistency, to follow up on our intentions, to send out a positive message and hence start really building this future. Not funding a strategy to combat the crisis because we are in a crisis would be a gloomy message that would be hard to justify. Right now, our citizens are expecting us to act consistently and with sincerity. However, they are not the only ones watching us: this year the markets are also particularly attentive to our decisions and our ability to take the necessary decisions – in the right ways and in the right timeframes – in order to get back on track.</p>
      <p sl="it">Sending out positive messages is therefore a particularly sensitive issue. In this respect, it would not only be great to produce a budget that makes a genuine start on putting the 2020 strategy in place, but it would also be really important for us to do so in an atmosphere of major institutional collaboration. Parliament decided to place huge trust in the estimates of the Commission precisely in order to send out a positive message. The Commission is undoubtedly working as well as is feasible at this difficult time, which is why Parliament deemed its estimates on payment requirements to be reliable.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is another emergency: the institutional frameworks of many Mediterranean countries are currently undergoing change. Europe cannot remain removed from this process; we cannot stand in the wings but instead we must take a central role in international politics. We therefore need to react to the crisis and assume renewed leadership on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="it">We request the use of the Flexibility Instrument for these two fundamental objectives. It will therefore be important to overcome these two challenges, instil confidence, prove our credibility and prove our reliability to citizens and the other institutions that are watching us. That is not all though, for I believe that this year there is yet another real challenge ahead: doing it in a transparent way. Indeed, our budget reading is not tactical or a negotiating tool: it is exactly the budget that this Parliament believes is essential for 2012, because I think this year it is also important to find a common position quickly and in good time, in order to communicate the essence, the ability and the image of a Europe that knows how to galvanise itself at the right time.</p>

    <intervention id="3-009-000" speaker_id="96899" name="José Manuel FERNANDES" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Portugal" birth_date="26-07-1967" birth_place="Vila Verde" m_state="PT">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we are experiencing a financial, economic and social crisis which requires and obliges all of the institutions to make an effort. At the same time, the crisis requires these institutions to have sufficient means at their disposal to address the concerns of the public. At present, this crisis is also proving an opportune moment for eurosceptics; extremists on the left and right who are finding fertile ground for populism and demagoguery. At such times these opportunists always find new ways of taking advantage of the difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, even they cannot hide the massive efforts in terms of real cuts that all the EU institutions are making in the 2012 budget. It should be noted that total administrative and operational expenditure for all of the institutions represents only 5.59% of the total EU budget. It should also be stressed that we have surpassed expectations for the Council, the Commission and Parliament, as shown by the margin of approximately EUR 500 million in Heading 5, which covers all the expenditure of all the EU institutions. This was managed in spite of new tasks, new Members of this House, the costs of Croatia’s accession, and the establishment of new institutions, such as the European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The overall increase in the 2012 budget for all the institutions is about 1%: far below inflation, meaning that there is negative growth, in real terms, in their budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to say to the Council that it cannot ignore the efforts and cuts made by all of the institutions, and that it has the opportunity to show that the institutions have already made as many cuts as they can in order to ensure greater rigour, and it is clear that commitments they have made cannot be delayed and must be met. Amongst other things, basic spending on electricity, security and maintenance must be ensured.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the European Parliament budget, I welcome the efforts made by the political groups and the Bureau of the European Parliament, which have led to real cuts, yet also to cuts that I deem damaging. Since the start of negotiations with the Bureau, we have cut more than EUR 74 million and have reached a comprehensive agreement with the Bureau, following several conciliation meetings, which led to the increase in the 2012 budget being the lowest since 1999, even though it includes the costs of Croatia’s accession and the 18 new Members. Once we include, in conciliation with the Council, the costs of Croatia’s accession, we forecast only a 1.9% increase in Parliament’s 2012 budget; in other words, well below inflation. It should be noted that the estimates that this House approved in April for the 2012 budget corresponded to a 2.3% increase, which did not include the costs arising from Croatia’s accession and the 18 new Members. In order to reduce these estimates, we reopened discussions with the Bureau and cut more than EUR 25.1 million.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If we are to be thorough and make a comparison with 2011, we have to remove these two new expenses arising from Croatia’s accession and the entry of the 18 new Members, which results in one of the lowest increases in the history of this Parliament: only 0.8%. However, despite these cuts, we will remain up to the job, and will still have the minimum enabling us to carry on with the European project, in order to live up to the European public’s expectations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-010-000" speaker_id="1037" name="Reimer BÖGE" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="18-12-1951" birth_place="Hasenmoor" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are proposing the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument in accordance with point 27 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, for the benefit of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs and the European neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say straight away that we are not submitting this report, which has been voted on by the Committee on Budgets, for a vote in plenary, because we are complying with the terms of the Treaty. We know that the Flexibility Instrument can only be mobilised jointly by the budgetary authority in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement. However, we believe that this is urgently needed to support the Europe 2020 strategy under Heading 1a with an additional EUR 30.7 million and to provide a further EUR 208.6 million for the neighbourhood policy, in the light of the requirements which have emerged as a result of developments in neighbouring areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say once more at this point that the European Parliament, given its commitment to a sensibly funded European budget, does not deserve to be criticised by the public and by the Council, as is sometimes the case. With regard to the obligations, the Commission and the Committee on Budgets are at the same level, while the Council is slightly lower.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of the payment appropriations, Parliament is slightly above the Commission proposal and with around EUR 3.7 billion a little higher than the Council proposal. That is where the classic difference lies. The Council or parts of the Council continue to regard the European budget as a hostile element. They see it only from the perspective of ‘what do I pay in and what do I get out?’. They also neglect one aspect, in a similar way to budgetary policy as a whole, which is the fact that the obligations that they have entered into must at some point be transformed into payments and the longer they hesitate, the greater the amount will be at the end of the day. That is exactly what we must avoid in proper budgetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we have had to explain constantly to the public that between 2000 and 2010 the national budgets in the European Union have on average increased by 62%, while the European Union budget has increased by 37%. At the same time, we have provided the necessary funding for expansion.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also part of this debate is the fact that in 2011, of the 27 Member States, 23 are spending more than in the previous year and, according to the most recent forecasts, in 2012 a total of 24 of the 27 Member States will have budget increases. This means that what we will be voting on today is a serious offer by Parliament to the Council in order to allow us to produce a sensible budget for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his efforts in the case of the Parliament budget. This is a budget with the lowest rate of increase for a long time. Without Lisbon and without Croatia, the increase is 0.8%. Overall the figure is 1.9% and this includes a sensible balance between the interests within the House.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I would also like to say that, given the situation in which we have done our homework on the Parliament budget for this year, showcase motions do not make sense. The House as a whole will confirm this.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, I would like to make it clear that all the institutions must consider how they can reduce costs and bureaucracy for the following few years of the next Multiannual Financial Framework, without impairing the efficiency and the ability to act of the European institutions. The European Parliament will also have to make a contribution in this area with a larger package.</p>

    <intervention id="3-011-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacek Dominik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened with interest to what has been said so far, and am very pleased in particular to hear the desire which has been expressed to be prompt and efficient in achieving approval of a realistic budget for 2012. We are all aware of the great efforts currently being made by the Member States and the serious budgetary restrictions they are having to face. Under no circumstances should a pessimistic signal be sent to the citizens of Europe at a moment when the Member States are trying to consolidate their budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I refer here to the fact that the Member States have managed to achieve – by a small majority of votes – agreement on the Council position on the 2012 budget. This agreement accepts an increase of 2.9% in commitment appropriations as compared to 2011 and an increase in payment appropriations of 2.02%. In reaching its position on the draft budget for 2012, the Council made particular efforts not to break the applicable ceilings of the Multiannual Financial Framework. Where needed, suitable margins have been ensured under certain headings to facilitate the management of unforeseen situations. Consequently, the Council is disturbed by the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, which would significantly reduce some of these margins or even mean exceeding the ceiling of the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Council would also like to express its regret in relation to the increases in payment appropriations which the European Parliament intends to put to the vote, particularly in a situation in which the level of these increases exceeds the amounts set out in the Commission’s draft budget for 2012. Even if the European Parliament does want to support accomplishment of its priorities and give emphasis to them, a level of payment appropriations should be established which is sufficient but not too high. We all have to realise that overestimation of the level of payments has contributed to an unnecessary increase in the budget deficit in many Member States and to an increase in borrowing needs, which in the current situation in the capital markets is very dangerous. In relation to this, it is necessary to make allowance for the use of financial resources in the future and also to include realistic needs for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would now like to mention several issues which are of particular importance to the Council. The Council is afraid that the increases which the European Parliament intends to put to the vote exceed the ceilings for Subheading 1a and Heading 4 by over EUR 240 million. The Council notes that the European Parliament intends, therefore, to propose mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument. As for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, the Council would like to reach agreement as soon as possible on granting the project additional funding. However, the Council would like to express its regret at the European Parliament’s rejection of all possibilities for the redeployment of budget appropriations in order to support funding of the project.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As for Heading 1b, the Council has accepted an increase of over 5% in payment appropriations. The Council is also worried by the amendments proposed by the European Parliament which expect restoration of the draft budget for 2012. This would result in an increase of over 8%. The Council also notes the efforts being made by the European Council to limit increases in funds which would mean exceeding the ceiling for Heading 4. It is, however, seriously concerned by the European Parliament’s proposals to decrease resources allocated to implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, because it is a policy which is of great importance to the Council and to the European Union as a whole. As for Heading 5, the Council would like to stress the importance of strict control of administrative expenditure, particularly by strengthening interinstitutional cooperation and increasing administrative efficiency. Such measures need to be employed to optimise the use of limited resources in relation to the rigorous fiscal consolidation currently being undertaken by all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, there is no difference between the Council and Parliament over the European Union’s priorities, and these priorities should be given support in next year’s EU budget. There is, however, disagreement over the level of funds necessary to ensure accomplishment of these priorities. That level, and in particular the level of payments, should be set in a way which does not result in excessive budgetary burdens for the Member States or force them to reduce other important expenditures financed from national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In closing, I would like to reiterate that the Council wants to express the hope and desire that the remaining stages of the budgetary procedure will progress in a positive atmosphere of cooperation, which will allow us to achieve, in these particularly difficult budgetary conditions, an agreement on the 2012 budget which will be satisfactory to all parties.</p>

    <intervention id="3-012-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the September plenary we discussed the Council reading. Now we have the Parliament reading, just several hours before it is to be finalised. It is clear that Parliament has taken a different approach from the Council on several very important issues and, if the Council is to reconfirm its position, despite the fact that we now have this very exceptional triangle with President Buzek, Minister Dominik and the Commissioner all coming from the same country, it is very likely that we will need a conciliation starting on 1 November and lasting 21 days.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the general line taken by Parliament and now endorsed by the rapporteurs Ms Balzani, Mr Fernandes and Mr Böge, we welcome the position to restore the draft budget in general. What is more, Parliament has exhausted the margins in Heading 1A; mainly the margins, but it is also asking for the flexibility instrument in Heading 1A and in Heading 4 more than requested by the Commission. As for the priorities, they are the same. We endorse the priorities reinforced by Parliament. I think we should finance the goals of the 2020 strategy better. This is also conducive to growth and jobs and we should accommodate it within the very restrained economic and fiscal framework of today’s Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the field of external action, we are in favour of the Flexibility Instrument but this is precisely to reinforce neighbourhood policy, a sensitive issue of great importance for all the institutions. We have to invest in the stability of our neighbourhood and it cannot be financed exclusively via redeployment. As for the numbers – I mean a EUR 400 million reinforcement – there is agreement between the institutions but we cannot just do this via redeployment. This is simply not workable under the present restraints of Heading 4.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now there is a different stance on ITER. Here the Commission’s mission to invent one more compromise amendment after the compromise amendments so far submitted makes sense only if there is goodwill to go in parallel and not to make ITER a hot issue as it was last time, which would make agreement over the 2012 budget more difficult.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now to the level of payments. The level of payments is always a sensitive issue. Our draft budget was based on the information delivered by the 27 Member States and we were placing the level of payments roughly EUR 9 billion below the margin for 2012. Therefore this already represents self-restraint, but now I can reconfirm that the payments are moving. This is not unusual at the end of a financial perspective. We have requests for payments. This year it is not about a surplus, it is about a shortage of payments for 2011, reflected already in Amending Budget 6/2011. This is the state of play regarding the payments; therefore we cannot endorse the position of the Council to limit payments in the framework of inflationary adjustment. We are facing a shortfall of payments in research and development and in other areas already this year 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the administrative budget, I think what has to be appreciated is the effort of the largest body, that is the Commission, to freeze nominally and not ask for any more posts. However, we note that Parliament was voting as usual for some reserves, hopefully to be released at the time of conciliation. Our letter of executability signed today should indicate also our position on pilot projects and preparatory actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last comment on the deprived persons scheme. We made an additional effort to release money in its total value, but regrettably last week’s Agriculture Council did not overcome the deadlock over the legal basis for the deprived persons scheme, therefore the Commission is forced to put part of the appropriations into the reserve: that is EUR 340 million out of EUR 500 million. There is still time to act and we still have time to act to release the overall amount.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ahead of the process of conciliation, our role is to submit the most updated forecasts on how it is developing this year. This is instructive for the next year and we are also to play as usual the role of honest broker in order to shape the compromise for 2012.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what can I say about Heading 4 that is not already common knowledge? It is a historically underfunded heading which we must nevertheless use to fulfil the European Union’s mounting commitments in the area of external action. We must rise to the challenge, which we have set ourselves, of making a global player of the European Union even though resources are once again – or rather, particularly this year – diminishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, we have to rely on this underfunded Heading 4 to finance previous commitments which were political priorities for the European Union in the past and must be carried through, as well as new priorities, such as providing funding for the ‘Arab Spring’ this year.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament and the Committee on Foreign Affairs have acted in an extremely responsible manner, using the utmost restraint to ensure we had the minimum necessary to meet the challenges that lie ahead. Thus, we have proposed that the allocations for inescapable priorities including Palestine and the Stability Instrument be reverted to those envisaged in the Commission’s draft budget, although unfortunately we have also had to make cutbacks in other areas which are equally important for Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the European Parliament’s Committee on Development has reiterated its priorities in its opinion on the 2012 budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, Heading 4 of the EU budget is chronically underfunded. It is important to rectify this, to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals become something more than a pipe dream.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second, the ‘Arab Spring’ is also a challenge for us in terms of the budget. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not the solution: we must mobilise additional resources. The same applies to funding policies that aim to mitigate the impact of climate change on developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Third, let us be more selective in how we allocate our funds. Let us target our budget resources at combating poverty in poor countries. Rich and emerging countries already generate enough resources to reduce poverty within their own borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourth, there are many of us who believe that without new forms of funding, in particular the financial transaction tax, we may not be able to afford to meet the goals we have set ourselves in the context of the European Consensus on Development.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in times of economic difficulties and fiscal prudence we still have to make investments which will create the economic growth and prosperity of tomorrow. In the Committee on International Trade (INTA), where I am rapporteur, we have approved initiatives of this type, such as the coordination platform for EU businesses to participate in global growth and Euromed innovation entrepreneurs for change. These two proposals were passed in the INTA committee almost unanimously.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first project opens the door to the involvement of many more SMEs in global growth. The second intends to incubate and spread business activities in North Africa through mentoring and partnerships with EU entrepreneurs. The members of my committee clearly saw the benefits of these projects and it is my sincere hope that the EU Council will see them too.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the main message from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is that the new European Financial Supervisory Authorities must be given the resources they need to be able to operate effectively.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is good that Parliament is now sending a clear signal to the effect that the supervisory authorities must be built up quickly and their budgets increased in line with the extension of their mandate. The fact that the Council wants to make cuts in the Commission’s draft budget is utterly absurd.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The work of the European Banking Authority in carrying out stress tests shows that supervision needs to be made more robust. The watering down of the stress test in June was largely due to the fact that the authority was not strong enough to withstand the banking lobby and individual national interests.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The more accurate reassessment of the test that the authority has now carried out indicates increased independence, but still does not provide an accurate picture of how bad the situation is in European banks. The aim must be for the authority to be able to act in a completely independent manner in the next test, and for that it requires adequate resources.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we welcome the fact that the Commission’s draft budget has been restored in the areas that concern the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The Commissioner was good enough to welcome this, and we feel this is important overall.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the first budget since 14 January 2011, and hence the first since the Arab democratic revolution began. We welcome and back the European Training Foundation’s initiative to secure EU budget funding to help support industrial relations and the development of the labour market, in the context of the dialogue we will be entering into with these southern Mediterranean partner countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, this is not the first budget of this economic crisis we are going through. We therefore feel that all initiatives that can be undertaken to support youth employment, especially through the pilot project we have begun, and the ‘Your first EURES job’ project for young people, are absolutely vital; and we hope that when the budget conciliation takes place, the budget for this project will be kept at the figure we voted for.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, let us not be under any illusions. We are in the same position in the budget process for 2012 that we find ourselves in every year: faced by a Council that does not understand the issues. As always, the Council has cut the appropriations for the Commission, even the not very large amount for the environment and climate change, for public health and for food and feed safety. Together with the four agencies, this amounts to just under EUR 1 billion, in other words, all of 0.67% of the EU budget. Therefore, we are very pleased that the Committee on Budgets has complied with all our requests and has restored the funding from the draft budget in all cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point I would like to give my warm congratulations to the rapporteur. Ms Balzani has done an excellent job. We are also pleased that the package which has been negotiated includes seven pilot projects and three preparatory actions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

All that remains now is for us all, together with the Council – and perhaps it will work – to ensure that good results for the citizens of Europe come out of the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy there has been a shared conviction from all sides that the budget priorities must reflect the strategic goals of EU 2020 and we are glad that the Committee on Budgets has also supported this position. For our committee there have been three particular priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the need for FP7 to be fully implemented in order to stimulate competitiveness and sustainability and help address the major societal challenges of our time. No money should be diverted from FP7 – I repeat, no money – and this is a shared view of the committee. We know that the fight with the Council over ITER will be hard but we should stick to this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Number two, in the current economic situation we need to support SMEs and all programmes that have proven their value for SMEs. Number three, we should see to the priorities in the energy policy and we are grateful to the Budgets Committee that they have helped us in sticking to this priority.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, we are all talking about the crisis today. Yes, it is a crisis. Member States are obliged to make fundamental cuts in national budgets and Union budgets. We have an acute lack of funds. I consider it wholly inappropriate that the Union budget has been increased by more than 2%, as the Member States proposed. The proposal we have on the table here today for a 4.9% increase makes me think that its authors inhabit a different economic reality.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Yes, I am in favour of a budget that supports employment. I am in favour of a budget that supports growth. This can be achieved, however, through a change in philosophy, not by a flat rate increase in all budget chapters, but by reviewing the case for currently funded projects and simply cutting the funding for the non-viable ones. We will then focus the resulting savings on areas such as the internal market, the functioning of which is key to the economic growth and competitiveness of the entire Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Dominik, in this committee there is basically one line in the budget which is of interest: trans-European transport networks. In fact, the proposal for cuts in this line in comparison with Parliament’s draft budget was the greatest, as it was over 10%. As far as the committee is concerned, this line is a fundamental priority. Furthermore, the Member States are also saying that trans-European transport networks are among their national priorities. So I do not see the consistency in Mr Dominik’s speech when he said that levels of payments should not interfere with national priorities. In this instance it would seem that they are interfering. I would like to welcome the response of Mr Lewandowski, who wants to be a spokesperson for our affairs concerning the reduction in payments proposed by the Council.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Our dispute is therefore not with each other but with the Council, and primarily concerns the payment appropriations for development resources. We consider it unacceptable to put the brakes on development in regions that are lagging behind. As the Commissioner also pointed out, the Commission’s draft budget includes a EUR 9 billion cut in the level of payments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We, the Committee on Regional Development, did not enter into this fight to start a haggling process. We thought that the Council too would consider it worthwhile and necessary to accept the wisdom of the Commission in this regard.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr Dominik, I would like to say something about the agricultural component of the budget. Now more than ever, Europe needs a strong common agricultural policy capable of ensuring consumers receive quality food at affordable prices, within a framework of environmental sustainability. We all know this to be the case. In view of all this, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reiterate the need for an adequate agricultural budget for 2012. I am pleased with the welcome that the budget proposals from the Committee on Agriculture have received in the Committee on Budgets, and I call for them to be confirmed by this House.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am still shocked at the decisions of the last Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries, and cannot refrain from speaking out about the unspeakable blocking of food aid to the most disadvantaged people by six Member States.

The European Union must be able to continue to fulfil its role in the fisheries sector. We want to promote dynamic growth. This also applies to the pilot projects which aim to strengthen marine research and integrated marine management.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, as budget coordinator for the Committee on Culture and Education, I am obviously pleased to see that our priorities look as though they will, by and large, be met in all areas – in only one case requiring more money than we had expected. This fact demonstrates well that the Commission has the same views in this area as Parliament, namely that we need – even in the middle of a time of austerity – to invest in areas that can actually produce growth and meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. In this regard, I am, of course, thinking in particular of the funds that, as it seems now, are earmarked for the Lifelong Learning Programme, which is central to the efforts to achieve the growth targets – first and foremost, of course, through the mobility programmes, Erasmus being one of the most successful of these.</p>
      <p sl="da">Sport has also received a small sum to get things off the ground. It is not as much as we had hoped, but it is nevertheless enough to get started. We obviously hope that the sports programme, once it actually attains the status of a programme, will be allowed to develop.</p>

But of course we also want to do our share in saving money.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that, before drawing up new programmes or prolonging existing ones, a thorough evaluation of the existing programmes should be carried out and we should very much follow the lessons learned. Furthermore, we believe that spending should be concentrated in areas where the EU has a clear added value. However, it does not make sense to create new agencies or give new tasks to existing agencies if we do not have a financial basis for that. An agency cannot carry out tasks for which it does not have money. We should take that into consideration when we are creating new programmes and setting up new agencies.</p>

It also brings the EU closer to its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the 2012 budget there is very moderate increase of 0.47% for the European Ombudsman. For example, no new posts have been requested and no new employees will be appointed.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes for their valuable work and all my fellow Members for the spirit of cooperation that we have seen this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission has done excellent work on the proposal for the draft budget. However, Parliament’s reading revealed a slight disagreement over the horizontal cuts made by the Council so Parliament essentially restored the commitments and payments to the draft budget levels, with a few exceptions.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must point out that 2012 is the sixth year of the financial perspective, which is something that must be fully reflected in considerations on the level of payments, given that many programmes and actions are nearing conclusion. Parliament today intends to give a complete demonstration of its responsibility for Europe, which is intimately linked to the ongoing crisis in the continent.</p>
      <p sl="it">We decided, following a process of sound rationale, to request the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for just two headings. First of all, Heading 4 has seen a series of unexpected and unforeseeable events that require a significant financial commitment that cannot be reconciled with the meagre 2012 margin. Secondly, under our proposal, Heading 1A is to receive an extra EUR 30.7 million to revive industrial competitiveness and to fund Parliament’s policy priorities, which reflect the heart of the 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believe that the European budget should, at times of crisis such as the present, provide a way to stimulate recovery that can generate real European added value. I hope that the Council can understand our approach and will show that it is open to negotiations carried out in a spirit of cooperation that aim at drawing up a smart and realistic budget together – a budget for the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to say a big thank you to Ms Balzani, Mr Fernandes and Mr Böge, who have succeeded in obtaining broad support for their proposals at a very difficult time, and that is important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When I meet with my constituents, I often encounter myths regarding the EU budget. Many people believe that the EU is a heavy and growing burden on taxpayers. They hardly believe me when I tell them that the EU budget corresponds to only around 2% of Europe’s public expenditure, that most of it goes back to the Member States and that the rate of increase is lower than that of the Member States’ own budgets. They also find it hard to believe that we do not have any debts and that every year we give the surplus back to the Member States. Unfortunately, they also often believe that all taxpayers would benefit from cuts in the EU budget. The truth is, of course, that it would make it harder for the most vulnerable countries to overcome the crisis. Certain Member States, with the Polish Presidency at the forefront, are defending the EU’s role in this situation against those who only care about the net result for their own national treasuries. I am grateful for this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the current situation, we have decided to take a cautious approach. We are making more cuts than ever before in the European Parliament’s own budget. We are asking for increases in only three priority areas: investments in research and development, jobs and lifelong learning, aid for Palestine and North Africa and payment appropriations for the Structural Funds, so that they really can be used to help to combat the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am very pleased that we in the European Parliament are in agreement about defending these requirements. I am convinced that there will in reality be support for them in many Member States, too. Let us try to find a solution that enables us both to defend the EU’s role and to strengthen these economic priority areas.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, for their excellent cooperation on this budget. My group would have liked to have accepted lower payment appropriations, but there was no majority support for this. However, we are able to support the result that we have ended up with. There is more money for research and education and the necessary amount has been allocated to foreign policy. We are therefore happy to support the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="da">I think that some of the savings that the Council has proposed are very strange. Mr Ludvigsson spoke of cuts for the new financial supervisory authorities. I am sorry, but we have a financial crisis out there that we need to resolve, and so it is very strange to start by cutting the budget of these institutions. What is the rationale behind that? I would say to the Council that I hope this time we can have a debate and a dialogue that concerns something other than merely the size of the payments and a simple percentage, and that we can get down to the crux of the matter and have a real debate on the needs of the EU budget. This also requires the Council to be willing to go into details and to look at what the actual needs are. I hope that we can have a constructive dialogue. My hopes are on the Polish Presidency. I think it has shown good intentions so far. It is a difficult task for the Polish Presidency, but I hope that we can find a solution so that we can have a budget fit for the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, timing is everything. We are holding our debate on the budget when the leaders of Europe are trying to resolve the eurozone crisis in Brussels. They are using the intergovernmental method and are keen on maintaining their primacy and supremacy in shaping European affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is anybody paying attention to our debate here? The draft budget fails to take into consideration the hard political realities of Europe. There are two aspects to it. First, Parliament does not seem to have learned the lessons of the trialogue from last year. Despite stern warnings, there are futile attempts again to increase payment appropriations by almost 5%. Does Parliament wish to suffer another humiliating defeat at the hands of the European Council in late December?</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, to insist on an increase of more than 4% in commitment and almost 5% in payment appropriations is flying in the face of European public opinion in times of severe austerity in most Member States and extreme austerity in some of them. It is a blatant disregard of the hardship suffered by the taxpayer when the countries in crisis need to cut back on spending and the donor countries are being asked to dole out ever-growing transfers. Can we live in an ivory tower when the European taxpayer is being asked in Brussels to cough up hundreds of billions of euros in order to save, not only the eurozone, but the whole European project?</p>
      <p sl="en">The ECR supports investment in the future, but prudent budgeting would require commensurate cuts in other items whenever there is a significant increase in clearly-defined priority areas. While Parliament’s draft resolution blames the Council for cuts in several hundreds of budget lines, Parliament represents the other extreme, proposing increases without significant cuts elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">The only positive sign on the horizon is the Fernandes report, which is to be commended for foreseeing long-overdue cuts in spending on translation and interpretation, freezing general expenses, travel costs, etc. The ECR Group would support all these amendments and call for further savings in due course.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, as budget coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the crucial criterion for me is that we have to manage natural resources in a sustainable way, national budgets must be set up in such a way as to do that and financial resources must also be managed in a sustainable way. That is something that we have learnt from the debt crisis in Europe. We are all called on to work together towards this goal in the three European institutions and to improve our policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all know how difficult the situation is in the Member States of this Union. We know that because we all come from the various Member States. We are not aliens in Brussels or Strasbourg who do not understand how difficult the situation is. However, those of us who are pro-Europeans are convinced that we need targeted political strategies to support the European budget and serve the common good of our economic and strategic interests and help our citizens to cope with the future. It is therefore right for the Europe 2020 strategy to be taken so seriously and for more investment to be made in the targeted areas of achieving a low-carbon economy, sustainability in connection with new products and technologies, energy saving and energy efficiency, because the success of the internal market and our global competitiveness depend on these types of new products and also on new jobs that are dependent on just such an economic policy that promotes a new competitiveness. For that reason, it is right to use the EU budget to focus on these interests, too, in order to make progress in these areas. That is not a hostile act towards the Member States; rather it is particularly smart from a strategic point of view to advocate European added value in this regard and thereby also promote the economic policy of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">We therefore need to make savings whilst at the same time investing wisely in sunrise industries. Where can we make savings? In our opinion, we need to make savings in areas where we are investing in the wrong high-risk technologies and spending money that is not genuinely being used in a future-oriented way, such as with regard to the ITER nuclear fusion reactor – an additional EUR 1.3 billion that is yet to be found. The majority of this House, the Commission and the Council are adamant about funding these high-risk technologies. Why is that? That is where we can make savings. We can also make savings in the European administrative budget. We have made that clear. We want to see savings of EUR 20 million on translations and simultaneous interpretation. I am also of the opinion that we can save money on business class flights. We do not need to fly business class on short-haul flights, where Flex Economy would suffice. I hope that you will still make a move in this direction, because this will also allow us to demonstrate that we are capable of self-restraint.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the first problem with this 2012 draft budget is that it was essentially decided in 2006. The major figures predate the crisis of 2008 and 2009, and predate the debt crisis: the proposal under discussion neither resolves nor reflects the crisis that is to come in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is a meagre budget that offers far too little for Europe’s needs, and only the governments seem to be convinced otherwise. The proposal’s second problem lies in its old commitments to very powerful interests. This budget spends more on security policy than on education; this budget supports big business more than small and medium-sized enterprises; this budget channels more resources into multinational pharmaceutical companies than into university research. We appreciate the rapporteur’s efforts, but you must understand that we cannot support this draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I shall now say a few words about Parliament’s budget. For the first time, efforts are being made to rein in spending, so I do not understand why these efforts are overlooking the incomes and expenditure of the Members themselves. This draft budget cuts EUR 21 million from interpretation and translation, with an impact on jobs and multilingualism, but it does not dare touch the funds available to us for our office expenses. A majority in this House advocates austerity policies. In some countries these policies are causing mass unemployment and cuts of 20-30% in salaries and pensions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Against a backdrop of such massive injustice, how can we stick to the unwritten principle that our own income is untouchable? How do you want the public to see us? Worse still, how can we bear to look our fellow citizens in the eyes? How can we possibly look them in the eyes? A Parliament that continues to insist that its Members’ incomes are untouchable is awash with irresponsibility and social insensitivity. In the next three hours, our consciences will decide the vote.

      <p sl="en">This House has turned a deaf ear to the Council’s proposal, as it is now asking for a 5.2% increase. The justification for the increase is the need for investments to take the EU out of the crisis. Stop! Think! Ask yourselves what happened with all the taxpayers’ money we have already invested to achieve the long-promised objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. Why do we need to put more money into failed projects like GALILEO, which is costing the taxpayer EUR 22 million?

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, and also our shadow rapporteur, Mr La Via, for carrying out a quick process with a lot of consensus on very conflictive issues, despite the originally very diverse positions and interests of the political groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">My political group’s standpoint is that this budget combines the necessary austerity with the sufficient level of funding, in terms of both commitments and payments. Our desire to avoid exceeding the ceilings for the headings has been partially fulfilled, given that we have two very specific reasons for exceeding them: the Neighbourhood Instrument and the Seventh Framework Programme. It should not be difficult to come to an agreement with the Council on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">The funding of ITER is more of a problem for the future, rather than for this budgetary year. My group cannot accept a heavily modified budget for 2012 because of the Council's position on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are waiting for conciliation on payments, but the Council should also consider the fact that the Commission will present an amending budget at the end of this year. This shows that the rate of credit uptake is higher than expected. Therefore, the Council’s wish to keep payments around 2% is incompatible with maintaining the research or cohesion policies in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="es">With respect to Parliament’s budget, I think this is the first time a truly stringent budget has been presented, in which we believe Members too will have to make sacrifices, such as the freezing of per diems or an overall reduction in travel expenses.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, can I also thank the rapporteur and in particular welcome the approach which has led to lowering the increase to an actual figure of 0.8%? I particularly welcome the freeze on the general expenditure allowance for 2012: a cut of 5% in the travel budget, savings in translation and interpretation costs, plus all the other savings we identified in our negotiations. The S&amp;D Group would perhaps have liked to have gone a little further, and that is why we have tabled amendments calling for a freeze in all allowances, including the daily allowance, for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also asked the Bureau to have a proper review of travel costs, including finding ways of reducing the number of business flights. We have also called for a comparative study of the European Parliament’s budget, comparing our budget with, perhaps, Member States’ parliaments and the Congress in the US. We have also called for a more transparent and open buildings policy and we would like to ensure that this Parliament is fully informed in the future about proposals on new building developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would have liked to have gone even further than that and called for a freeze in all allowances for the rest of this particular mandate.

We have shown that we can make savings and, at the same time, we can protect the proper functioning of this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, good morning Commissioner, good morning President-in-Office of the Council. I believe that the rapporteur, Mr Fernandes, has for the first time in years achieved a significant breakthrough in respect of this part of Parliament’s budget, and I am pleased that the cooperation was so constructive, particularly with the Secretariat and the Bureau.</p>
      <p sl="de">At a time when people are having to tighten their belts, we have helped to demonstrate that money can actually be used efficiently and that savings can be made, despite everything. At a time when there is a discussion going on in every Member State about how to deal with this crisis, I believe that the fact that we have set a good example here is an important signal. We have achieved savings amounting to tens of millions – nearly 74 million, in fact. Mr Vaughan has just explained what that equates to in the budget in terms of percentages.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I am sure that we still have the potential to make further savings. It is not absolutely necessary for us to purchase and renovate a building for EUR 30 million in order to meet here. I believe that resources can be used much more efficiently in this regard. Incidentally, I also believe that we would discover significantly more potential savings and be able to create a smarter and more efficient administrative structure if, rather than it being only the budget lines in which savings are proposed by the Secretary-General of this House that are presented to the competent Committee on Budgets, the committee were to be given an overview of the whole budget, as we could then see how the resources are used overall, enabling us to work on the structure.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say that we could save around five times as much if we held these part-sessions in Brussels and did not meet each month in Strasbourg.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to rise to support the line taken this morning by my group, which is looking for savings as well as spending funds in the budget of 2012. In the discussions so far I think we have been right to be able to focus on priorities for the European Union but, in the context of the big discussions today and tomorrow elsewhere on the continent about how we are going to be dealing with our debt problems, I think that in this 2012 procedure we have not yet focused sufficiently on where savings could be generated in the budget so that we can then find the monies for future programmes on competitive innovation and other things where we have a large consensus in the House.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have presented information for the budget procedure on where we can get funding of up to EUR 2 billion, savings where lines have been insufficiently implemented. When we move into conciliation with the Council, we are going to have to focus very clearly on those lines where we can identify that we are spending money inefficiently and unwisely.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, our group will be abstaining from this vote. Our abstention is the outcome of conflicting reactions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the one hand, we cannot help but deplore the Commission’s inertia, or even ‘autism’ over the energy question. Since our previous budget debate, the Fukushima nuclear disaster has happened. Germany, Italy, Switzerland and others immediately learnt fundamental lessons from it. However, at the Commission, and this budget is a reflection of this, there is little movement, if any. There has been some barely noticeable tinkering around the edges, together with this obstinate persistence in supporting ecologically and technologically dead-end projects, such as shale gas, or the very costly ITER project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, we want to add our weight to the vast majority who are against the unsustainable budget cuts the Council has made. By cutting EUR 3.5 billion payment appropriations at a time when the 2012 financial year is approaching, with the 2007–2013 contracts reaching their term: at a time, therefore, when there is a high level of importance attached to needs, the measure the Council is proposing is not an economy measure, but one of strangulation. Parliament should stand together in the face of this kind of anti-Europe attitude.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we approach the negotiations, it is important to remind ourselves that the EU budget has never been in deficit, that there is no EU debt, and that through our pooling of resources and policies, this budget yields a high return in terms of value added. If we attack the European Union’s financial resources, we will not combat the economic and financial crisis: we will worsen it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, for years, the size of the EU budget has been hovering at more or less the same level. In that time, the responsibilities of the EU have continually expanded and the need for finance has increased significantly. Thus, financial market supervision made it necessary to establish new institutions. However, in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks effectively, these institutions need adequate financial resources. As a result of the financial and banking crisis, the economic weaknesses of some Member States of the EU have become clear. A comprehensive economic recovery plan would be needed to strengthen the economies of these countries. Some economic experts even talk of the need for a Marshall Plan for the crisis-stricken Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU does not need austerity programmes that impair growth; instead it needs a growth-promoting spending programme that will safeguard jobs and incomes for workers and young people in the EU. Yet what does the Council do in this situation? It curtails the Commission’s proposal, which already falls far short of what is needed. If an appropriate increase in the budget is not feasible in the current political climate, Parliament and the Commission should at least do everything they can to ward off the cuts proposed by the Council.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is at times of crisis like this that Europe must provide genuine answers and offer real added value – quite apart from a budget increase that is, perhaps, excessive. Cutting funding for small and medium-sized enterprises under the Seventh Framework Programme was therefore absolutely out of the question, which is something I am very pleased about.</p>
      <p sl="it">Frontex is another important point. The Council was wrong when it gave Frontex new powers without providing it with adequate resources. Parliament has certainly shown greater responsibility on this point and on the whole question of immigration and border control.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report cites Parliament’s travel expenditure among the costs to be cut. There is no use in beating about the bush: the real savings would be made by cutting out Strasbourg. The treaties can be amended and under these difficult circumstances the issue of Parliament’s location should finally be reviewed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament’s guideline in connection with the draft general budget of the EU for 2012 is, above all, to target measures at achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The 2012 budget is, in fact, a shrinking budget. Additional costs for the accession of Croatia and 18 new MEPs provided for under the Treaty of Lisbon must be included.</p>
      <p sl="de">The result is a total increase of 1.9% compared with the 2011 budget. It should be mentioned that this is the lowest rate of increase for 15 years. In the past, we have succeeded time and again in managing new tasks and the additional costs arising from them without any serious increases, for example the introduction of the three new financial market agencies.</p>
      <p sl="de">I consider the most urgent tasks ahead of us to be the completion of the internal market and greater investment in education, particularly for our young people. I would also like to thank Ms Balzani, Mr Böge and Mr Fernandes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteurs on the quality of their work, and to add a further commentary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Barely two years ago, as some of our fellow Members seem to have forgotten, finance ministers were accusing the EU of spending too little too slowly. It is a cruel irony in that right now, the Council is trying to find a solution to the excessive indebtedness to which this attitude has led.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament has been keen to participate in finding solutions since this crisis first began. We are aware, President-in-Office of the Council, of the constraints from which national budgets can no longer escape. They are measured in terms of payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are willing to come to an agreement quickly, but we will be watching four particular points closely. The first is how far Parliament’s priorities, as mentioned by our rapporteurs, are taken into consideration, especially as regards spending on competitiveness and on Europe’s international action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second is consistency between decisions made by the Council and how these are translated into budgetary terms. Finance ministers sometimes present a skewed picture of this consistency, for example in the areas of immigration policy and resources for financial oversight.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is justice to countries that most need EU aid in order to catch up on delays to which tragic historic events have condemned them. These countries must not become the indirect victims of some Member States’ poor management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fourth point is funding for the flagship Europe 2020 priority initiatives. The financial markets themselves are now realising that a return to growth will be the surest way of guaranteeing that debt will be paid back.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We often accuse the markets and bankers of being short-sighted. Let us not become blind now, just when they are starting to be a bit more clear-sighted.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, for my part I would like to congratulate both Ms Balzani and Mr Bütikofer, who was the rapporteur in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. I would like to mention three brief points: first, it may be that we have no more money, but we definitely need more Europe, a stronger internal market, more solidarity, more regional support and more growth.</p>
      <p sl="hu">My second point is that the budget of the European Union is not spending but investment – investment in the future, investment in the economies of the Member States. This is the only way to bring about smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This can create new jobs in the European Union, which is what combating poverty is really about. The European Parliament will certainly insist on this in the fight between the Council and Parliament. We will not be drawn into the sort of deal that jeopardises our common policy, the goals of the 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking our rapporteurs, who have done an excellent job so far. However, we are far from finished with these budget negotiations and we still have some very difficult negotiations with the Council ahead of us. The fact is that the level of expenditure that we now have on the table is something that the Member States will not accept. This means that we need to find a common viewpoint.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is also something that I have emphasised in my capacity as the person responsible for the 2012 budget on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and we would have liked to have seen a lower level of expenditure. We also proposed cuts in the budget that we, unfortunately, did not receive support for in the votes in the Committee on Budgets. That is also the reason why we will probably abstain in the vote on the resolution today.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The positive aspect is that we are in the process of shifting the main focus to what is referred to as Europe 2020, where we have higher costs for, and possibilities to invest in, research, development, innovation and so on. This is good, but at the same time we ought to realise that the economic situation will not allow the budget to increase to whatever we happen to want it to be. We therefore need to be able to prioritise, and this, unfortunately, is where Parliament’s weakness lies. We are good at finding new ways to spend money, but not nearly as good at finding ways to save it. In this regard, we had hoped that we would be able to conduct a more constructive debate on where we could spend less. We did not succeed in doing so, and this will be a challenge ahead of the negotiations with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as we ask citizens to tighten their belts, they ask us what we are doing. The European Parliament should lead by example but does not have any record of austerity. On the contrary, its budget has been increased to over EUR 1.6 billion. Until recently cuts in the budget of the European Parliament were regarded as an anti-European act, but in current conditions it is a pro-European act.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a member of the ECR, I have always proposed an overhaul of the budget of the European Parliament. Together with my colleague Geoffrey Van Orden, I recently launched a paper in the framework of our think tank, New Direction, to cut the budget of Parliament over the years by 25%. New Direction’s paper is called ‘Ending the Excess’ and a copy has been sent to members of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to cut excess in Parliament, like subsidies for restaurants. We have to review the language regime and limit the number of languages for translation of documents in preparatory stages and we have to scrap the House of European History, which is a prestige project out of place and will become the white elephant of the European Parliament, for which citizens will despise us.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, now that the whole of Europe is in the grip of a serious crisis, the budget that we are proposing is, all things considered, actually a kind of a disgrace. A disgrace, because we are not making any serious attempt to cut our spending fundamentally, for example by abolishing a number of completely useless European institutions, agencies and subsidies. I am thinking, in particular, here of the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee. These are institutions whose concrete usefulness I am yet to be convinced of and, yet, which cost the taxpayer EUR 200 million annually. To say nothing of the EUR 9 million which is annually spent on EuroparlTV, the EUR 3 million which we are now giving away to the Turkish occupiers of Cyprus, and a lot of other pointless rubbish.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another reason why this is a disgraceful budget is because we have not succeeded in keeping our own pay and this Parliament’s own costs down to a reasonable level. Those who are calling such criticism hypocritical had better adopt the cutback amendments in the vote. If that happens, then we will no longer have any hypocrisy and we will finally be sending out a signal to our own citizens that we, the privileged ones, are also prepared to make a serious effort.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we are debating the 2012 budget at the same time as the European Council in Brussels is discussing national budget problems. I find it ironic that we are approving the EU budget at the same time as budget aid schemes are being approved. I think that it is imperative for us to do this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are discussing the crisis, jobs and the need for investment. The EU budget preserves and creates jobs. The development of investments and the economy helps reduce the deficit. Investment amounts to 95% of the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are discussing the need for European networks: transport, energy and communication. The EU budget invests in this area. We say that the European Union is the strongest economy in the world and that all we need to do is complete the single market, particularly the services market, to be able to maintain this position. The EU budget contributes to this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have set ourselves EU 2020 strategy targets for education, employment and young people. The EU budget helps us meet them. At the same time, it is said that there are Member States which contribute more and others which contribute less, and that the budget allocation is not in the same proportion. However, we have not seen any study highlighting the real benefits of the European Union budget up to now.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to know how much of every euro invested in a Member State remains in that Member State, and how much is transferred to other Member States. I would also like to know what influence this budget exerts on labour mobility. Perhaps the Commission will carry out such a study.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that one euro invested in a region of the European Union has an influence in all the other regions. The EU budget safeguards the European Union’s future and, regardless of the situation that we are going through today, our future depends on the future of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Heading 4 is structurally underfunded with respect to the EU’s commitments and strategic interests. This has forced us to make painful choices to protect our priorities and particularly resources for Palestine, which are clearly necessary, especially in the light of the decisions taken by the United States Congress.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is what is behind the cuts to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) budget, which are not generic, linear cuts but policy-based cuts on specific issues, which do not therefore affect other operations. First of all, Afghanistan: this is a painful cut, but at the same time we must be aware that, despite the good results of our mission, the EU is a bit-part player on this issue, subordinate to the strategies of others which, moreover, are not seeing great success.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of emergency measures, the issue of special representatives is coming to the fore, so this is a logical cut to make. In terms of preparatory measures, the Council rejects Article 51(5)(c) of the Financial Regulation, which gives Parliament a limited role in these measures, in line with the Madrid agreement. Hence, this cut is inevitable. It is not Parliament that has chosen this path of austerity: the Council can hardly be taken aback by its consequences.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, for the second year running we are in a no-win situation, as the Commission – correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner – has produced a budget proposal that will barely be enough to implement the programmes we have undertaken, and will certainly not develop them or take on board the powers of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Council is clinging to its austerity dogma, and arbitrarily deciding on cuts to programmes that are extremely important in the light of the economic and social climate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our proposal seeks to mobilise the EU budget to work towards the Europe 2020 strategy goals, and places the emphasis on programmes for research, employment, competitiveness, cohesion and public investment. It is a cohesive position, and one which we owe to the strong commitment of our rapporteur, Ms Balzani. We owe her our thanks for this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU budget is underfunded, due to the squeeze by Member States whose only goals are austerity, reducing public expenditure, punishing the regions – I am referring to macroeconomic conditionality – and punishing citizens, starting with the most deprived among them. I am referring to the deplorably sad fate that the Council intends to mete out to the European food aid scheme for the most deprived.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we take an honest look at the situation, at present we have no own resources, no Eurobonds, a predominantly intergovernmental method, a budget that is derisory, as this discussion also seems to be, considering the stakes at play in the European Summit and the billions that Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are waving about to reassure the financial markets.</p>

Within this budget, we are also emphasising the need to strengthen European Union investment in order to provide us with an intelligent, supportive and sustainable policy of growth.

      <p sl="pl">I would like to draw attention specifically, here, to amendments which increase the funding of the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Youth in Action Programme and the whole series of programmes related to the Seventh Framework Programme on research and innovation. I would very much like the Council to take a close look at these amendments and to look favourably at the objectives which Parliament has set itself, so that the budget for next year will give particular attention to questions related to the innovativeness of the economy and to prospects and opportunities for young people, particularly in a situation in which an issue of very great importance is unemployment among young people and their permanent lack of the skills they need to be able to find a place in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We do know, of course, that what the European budget and European policies propose in this area is not enough, but I do think that it is a very important signal showing the direction in which the European Union should move – towards support for growth and employment. I am pleased, too, by the increase in payments for cohesion policy which has been proposed by the Commission. Parliament supports increasing payments for cohesion policy. I would like the Council to support this, too, because we can already see that these payments are going to be very much needed next year.</p>

Yes, today we are expecting a codecision which should be adopted in Brussels, but whatever decision is taken it will have to be financed and the 2012 budget may therefore be an historic budget which will perhaps enable Europe to stabilise the economic situation and possibly also guarantee growth. I believe that to do this, as many have already said, we must not reduce investment in research work and innovation. The common agricultural policy should also be reviewed so that in future all Member States are funded more fairly, so we can guarantee the creation of additional jobs. Of course, our main objective is probably more efficient use of funds. We should devote all of our attention to this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, and the shadow rapporteur, Mr La Via, for their excellent work on the 2012 budget. It represents a victory for Parliament considering this period of austerity, despite the difficulties in keeping the increases to a minimum. For the first time, the objectives and priorities of the 2012 budget are built around young people, small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="it">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I can declare myself satisfied, because the funding for the Daphne programme, which supports measures to combat violence against women, has been restored to the levels proposed by the Commission. The Institute for Gender Equality has retained the level of funding set out in the draft budget and therefore I once again offer my congratulations on the work carried out.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am not going to support the proposed budget increase. The majority of this House wants to increase the liabilities by almost 4% and payments by more than 5%. This is in stark contrast to what is currently happening in all the capitals of Europe. There, people are working hard to implement cuts and to balance expenditure and income. Parliament is closing its eyes to reality and is continuing the trend of recent years: more, more, more.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, things seem to be moving in the right direction in one aspect of the new proposals. The Committee on Budgets has adopted a proposal of mine to hold back 15% of the money allocated for travel costs. First of all, the Secretary-General of Parliament must demonstrate that more money really is needed for travel, then we will decide in the coming spring whether we are still going to make that percentage of 15% available and, if so, how. In my opinion, this will soon become the standard course of things for every budget procedure.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, once again this budget makes quite clear the extent and the real meaning of Europe’s much-vaunted solidarity. A figure that is only 1.08% of the total gross income of the Twenty-Seven and is more than EUR 8 billion lower than the one provided for in the Multiannual Financial Framework agreed in 2006, the little more than EUR 130 billion provided for in payments for 2012 renders any economic and social cohesion increasingly unfeasible, in the context of the ongoing aggression against countries targeted by International Monetary Fund and EU programmes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately, we are increasingly seeing a divergent Europe, and this budget proves it. To give a sense of scale, and an idea of the EU’s real nature and objectives, the overall total of this budget is near, very near, to a sum whose channelling into the recapitalisation of Europe’s banks has been accepted. Once again, this budget goes further than it should in terms of external interventionism, militarism and the repression of immigration; once again it falls far short of what was needed in terms of cohesion, employment, social issues and environmental preservation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to raise one last concern about the cuts to Parliament’s budget. There are cuts of more than EUR 20 million to the interpretation and translation service, which represents a serious and unacceptable threat to multilingualism and to the jobs of many workers who provide a function that is essential to the operation of this House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that the Commission has chosen its priorities well. Above all, we must pursue a future-oriented strategy in order to create new income and new jobs. Therefore, the European budget is very well placed to provide the right structures. To those Members who are in favour of savings in Parliament, I would suggest that they also set an example themselves and make these savings accordingly. I believe that it is also necessary to set clear targets here. By 2014, we want to see advance structuring also taking place in the budget that will put us in a position to be able to get to grips with the debt crisis. Perhaps the financial transaction tax could also be a means of providing the euro safety net with creditworthiness in future, so that those who avail themselves of the bonds will receive the guarantee through this creditworthiness that the bonds can also be paid back.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, having familiarised myself with the document we are debating today, I have to say it does not strike me as a budget for a time of crisis. Everything is shared out as before — a little more for one and a little less for another, but it is not clear from the budget what in the end we wish to resolve during this crisis by implementing this budget. This relates not only to the common agricultural policy but also to science, cohesion and such a sector as control. Here, in Parliament, the control bodies often report on the squandering of hundreds of billions of euros. Yet at the same time, the budget provides for a cut in funding for the control bodies. I cannot explain this to my electorate in Latvia.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to congratulate all our fellow Members, but especially our rapporteur, Francesca Balzani, for her substantial, committed report. Whilst barely exceeding the overall figures of the Commission’s draft budget, it allows for support to much-needed programmes, for which EU expenditure provides clear value added, in a spirit that is directly opposite to the Council’s blind cuts. I am referring in particular to the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund, and to research and lifelong learning. These European policies are vital tools for implementing the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During this time of economic crisis, we certainly do need to prove to citizens that everyone is doing their bit, but not by cutting budgets that are vital to their future. The EU institutions are sending out this message by reducing their own running costs, and MEPs are doing so by freezing their allowances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the negotiation with the Council will be difficult, and I look forward to the day when our budget will essentially be funded by own resources. If this does not happen, some Heads of State or finance ministers will always find spending on Europe too high, crisis or no crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets has followed the advice of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and decided to increase the budget in comparison to the framework presented to us by the Commission for Heading 2, ‘Agriculture and Environment’.</p>
      <p sl="it">Currently, the budget loss of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is 12.6% in real terms. This cut makes it unrealistic to reach such ambitious objectives as those set out in the legislative package on the new, post-2013 CAP, as presented to us a few days ago by Mr Cioloş.</p>
      <p sl="it">The increase of EUR 200 million that we in the Committee on Budgets asked for is for funds that would have been limited to fruit and vegetable producers to tackle future crises, like last year’s killer bacteria, which we all remember so well. I hope the vote this morning will prove us right.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to quickly mention another two headings where I am at pains to stress that an increase in EU funding is needed as never before. I am talking about food aid for the most deprived – a matter of priority for my country – an area in which debate over a new legal basis has reached another impasse in the Council. I am also referring to the amendment that we requested to increase expenditure on the management of migratory flows, which affect – and benefit – Italy more than most countries, given its position on the edge of Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="3-065-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, listening to the exchange of views, it is clear to me that positions remain different, therefore we have to reconcile the position and we will proceed with the November conciliation. I have the same impression as Mr Hartong – that of déjà vu – because we are still struggling, as rightly indicated by Mr Färm, with the same prejudices and the same stereotypes that are simply not true.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to one of them, ‘everybody is cutting and you are growing’. This is not true. On several occasions I have presented statistics showing that the national budgets of the 27 – with very few exceptions – are growing between 2009 and 2012. They are growing, despite efforts to save and reshuffle, but nominally they are growing. The European budget is the same combination of restraint and respect for legal obligations. We still have phasing-in in agriculture. This year we have unpaid research contracts. We should be serious about our pledges to the Arab world, which involves additional expenditure, and we should respect the logic of a budget which is very well known. But at the end of a financial perspective the payments in cohesion are moving, and we are still EUR 18.8 billion less – as set out in the draft – than the forecasts coming from the same Member States to Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is the first stereotype, and I will talk briefly about the second, because it has been already responded to by many speakers. It is intellectually dishonest to see a European budget which is equivalent to 2% of public expenditure as one of the root causes of a fiscal and financial crisis in Europe. If we now try to increase cofinancing for the countries which are in real trouble (i.e. the six countries, including Greece) and reduce the finances on their side, this means that structural funds (meaning investment) with a multiplier effect could be conducive to growth and jobs and should be the solution to the problem, and not the problem itself. The roots of the crisis are elsewhere.</p>

    <intervention id="3-066-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacek Dominik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the debate which has just taken place on Parliament’s priorities and the approach to negotiating the EU budget for 2012. I would like to say sincerely that much of what has been said has encouraged me. I have the impression that we are all beginning to understand the need to depart from the traditional way of approving the budget, which – I remember it this way, at least – has been more or less the same for over a decade: the Council presented its draft, Parliament increased all the budget lines to more or less the same extent and we came together somewhere in between. We were all happy with this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Times have changed. We have a crisis, and no one in the Chamber can deny it. We have to look at the EU budget in a different way. The EU budget – as Mr Lewandowski has also pointed out – must grow and is growing. It is not a budget which is getting smaller, and we now have to agree on a scale of growth which is acceptable to all of us. We cannot continue to proceed according to the same formula. We are in a crisis and we have to choose our priorities. We have to specify what in fact the Union most needs at the moment and where we have to allocate funds, and we have to do exactly the same work as is being done by all the Member States. They have their budgets, they have limited resources and they have to choose what in fact needs to be funded in this situation, and they have to determine the level of payments necessary to meet those expenditures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to remember that the times are uncertain. We do not know what will happen in a few months’ time. Therefore, I am greatly worried by the move in the European Parliament towards using all the margins already – you are even using the flexibility mechanisms. If something unexpected happens next year, we will not have any resources from which to draw additional funds for this purpose. In my opinion, the practice – which unfortunately has become a permanent one during this financial perspective – is that almost every year we renegotiate the Multiannual Financial Framework, and this is not a good thing. This was not the purpose of the exercise we carried out many years ago. At the time, we agreed maximum levels of expenditure and we all treated this very seriously. Resources were shared out, taking a variety of criteria into account. We cannot negotiate everything every year and enter into negotiations on the financial perspective every time. As a matter of fact, in this situation we do not have to sit down to these negotiations now, because in any case they do not have any great significance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to think about how to secure the Union and the Union budget for the future, particularly in uncertain times. We also have to rebuild the credibility of the European institutions. We must not allow discussions between the two institutions to be carried on which are long and completely incomprehensible to those outside – we will all be explaining to those outside that we are acting in the interests of the citizens, but in fact no one knows what the problem involves. At the moment the Union has to regain credibility. The EU institutions have to demonstrate that they are able to reach agreement by the prescribed deadline and produce solutions which are good for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must not forget about one very important thing – about the fact that the present crisis and the discussion which will take place today in the European Council will concern the excessive debt in the European Union. This means that the European Union has spent too much in previous years. The Member States have spent too much money. This in turn shows something else: pouring money in as a remedy to every problem that arises is not a good solution. Sometimes it is necessary to sit down and consider if the money we are putting in really is helping to solve a specific problem. This is in fact the moment we face now. We all have to sit down and think, knowing what our priorities are. The Council is not questioning the European Union’s priorities. It is only asking that we sit down and talk reasonably together about what we can in fact afford with the limited funds we have available.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to mention one more important thing. We often say we want to help particular Member States, to give them additional funds to stimulate their economies. Let us remember that these funds come from their budgets. They first have to find these additional funds, which later come back to them, and this is sometimes very difficult. I know from the budget of the country from which I come that every extra PLN 1 billion allocated to the EU budget is a decision about a potential reduction of expenditure on other purposes or a reduction of expenditure on cofinancing. We now therefore have to find a balance between what we will leave in the national budgets for cofinancing, and what we will transfer to the EU budget to help those countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members, as well as Mr Lewandowski and Mr Dominik, for this very interesting debate, which has seen a very important issue come to the fore. There is real unity in Parliament on this budget reading and I think this is due to something that has perhaps rarely been seen: Parliament has not limited itself to asking, but has also proposed painful cuts. As a number of my fellow Members have pointed out: on Heading 4 alone – one of the most difficult – Parliament has taken on the responsibility of making almost EUR 90 million of cuts.</p>
      <p sl="it">The motion has therefore been drawn up through effort and hard work, and – I would stress –not to fund Parliament’s priorities but to fund the Union’s priorities, because the Europe 2020 strategy is not a priority for Parliament but rather a priority for the Union. Today we are here to fund it, asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million. We are talking about a total budget of EUR 150 billion, within the financial perspective of 2006, set up before the 2008 crisis, before the Europe 2020 strategy and even before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force.</p>
      <p sl="it">Here, today, we are asking to invoke the Flexibility Instrument for EUR 240 million, to start to fund the EU’s priorities, which we have put on the table as a way to fight the crisis. I therefore hope that our shared vision of the priorities that you have mentioned on a number of occasions, Mr Dominik, can reach its zenith in the conciliation procedure. It is difficult to talk about priorities if you do not want to take that extremely important step of turning written priorities into priorities that are realised, true, real and tangible.</p>
      <p sl="it">The year 2020 is almost upon us: we cannot wait for a new Financial Framework to start funding it and, as many fellow Members have said, it is not only citizens that are waiting to see what we do but also the markets. Therefore, I really hope that in the conciliation procedure we, as a budgetary authority, can find the unity that Parliament has found and I hope we can do so quickly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner and Mr Dominik, and in particular all the Members and shadow rapporteurs who made this budget possible. I would also like to say something about Parliament’s budget, and a word about the Bureau of the European Parliament, as we have done a difficult yet fruitful job which, with the openness of the Bureau and its collaboration, enabled us to cut more than EUR 74 million from Parliament’s budget, as I have already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to make some clarifications in relation to the savings on interpretation and translation spending. We will have a slightly squeezed principle of multilingualism. This principle is sacred to us, and the reduction in interpretation and translation expenditure is part of structural cuts which mean, for example, that committee meetings that were concentrated into Tuesday and Wednesday are to take place from Monday to Thursday. We have defended the principle of multilingualism from the very beginning, and it will never be called into question.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In terms of travel, we have proposed a 5% cut for all kinds of travel, and in order for there to be a proposal by the Bureau in good time, by 31 March, we have requested that 15% of the travel appropriation be placed in reserve.</p>
      <p sl="pt">General expenditure is a competence of the Bureau of the European Parliament, so in the conciliation meetings we asked the Bureau – and this forms part of the overall agreement – to freeze such expenditure, and that is what is happening. We have complied with the rules and competences of all parties in making savings. However, these savings do not put at risk the objective that we have set ourselves, namely excellence in lawmaking. Parliament and its institutions do have an austerity budget, but at the same time it is a budget sufficient for us to comply with the European project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my hope that, if we follow the sound approach and the willingness of the Polish Presidency, we will be able to resolve the outstanding issues with regard to the 2012 budget in an intensive dialogue with Parliament in November. I would like to add that the spirit of the budget conference last Thursday and Friday in Brussels, which was attended by the national parliaments, the Council, the European Parliament and others, was in fact characterised by a willingness to listen to one another, to meet each other half way and to find a credible, coherent common approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I have to be quite honest, Mr Dominik, you have just undermined this positive impression somewhat with your appeal. As Parliament and as directly elected Members, we do not need an appeal from the Council for unity and for us to take responsibility. We meet our responsibility better than the Council, and I will not be told the ground rules by the Council when, for example, on the basis of Article 120 and disregarding Parliament’s budgetary rights, the Council mobilises EUR 60 billion in one long night, exceeding the ceiling of the financial framework and the ceiling of our own resources. No laws may be enacted that exceed either one of these two ceilings. When it comes to such appeals, take a look at yourselves first.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, it is also the case that the instruments on which we are to negotiate, such as the Flexibility Instrument or even, if necessary, the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, are part of the Interinstitutional Agreement and thus part of the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore expect us to discuss the size of the commitments and payments in a calm and sensible manner, and I will say it again: do not compare applies with pears. Firstly, we do not create debt in the European budget. Secondly, I will repeat something that I have said before: the European budget has increased by 37% in the last 10 years, whereas the national budgets have on average increased by 62%. Therefore, let us finally start to dispel the myths and not use the European budget as a weapon for negative national attacks against European integration and budgetary policy. If we succeed in doing that, we will also find a solution.</p>

These may impress at a political level but in reality are not that effective unless taken with major cost-cutting measures. During a five-year legislature, over EUR 1 billion is wasted due to having two duplicate European Parliament locations, Brussels and Strasbourg. Why is the report silent on having just one location? I sense an attitude of political hypocrisy! By voting in favour of cuts which are less effective, we are conveniently bypassing the real and meaningful cost-cutting measures.

These were aimed at increasing funding for social and environmental-protection areas, and changing the content and distribution of the funds, including cuts in the areas of the military and repression of immigration. With only about EUR 130 billion in planned payments for 2012, this makes any economic and social cohesion unfeasible, and this is all the more severe in view of the aggression currently underway against countries targeted by International Monetary Fund and EU programmes. With regard to Parliament’s budget, we regret that there has been a cut of EUR 21 million to interpretation and translation services, representing a serious and unacceptable threat to the principle of multilingualism and to the jobs of many workers, whose activities are vital to the functioning of Parliament and the protection of multilingualism.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The EU budget must be a balancing instrument with a leverage effect in respect of Member State recovery policies. It must initiate and support national investments in boosting growth and employment in fulfilling the common approved objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Council has proposed a low level of payments. This will lead to a greater difference between payment and commitment appropriations. This automatically increases the outstanding commitments at the end of the year, leading to further costs due to the interest charged on late payment. It is, to the contrary, necessary to increase structural and cohesion fund payments in the regions most affected by the financial and economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today’s debates on the 2012 budget are very reminiscent of last year’s discussions. The arguments of both the Council and Parliament are the same. The economic crisis continues so the Council’s goal of cutting all costs as much as possible is understandable. I believe that this really has been taken into account in Parliament’s position. The budget is only increasing by 1.9%, which is less than inflation, and there has also been agreement on some reductions in the size of the budget. I agree that it is necessary to guarantee strict discipline in budgetary execution, but we also should not forget financial commitments that have been made, the non-implementation of which will have consequences in the long term. Once again I would like to stress what I have often said, that in order to overcome the crisis we must invest in the future. It is necessary to provide adequate funding for priority programmes that stimulate economic growth and job creation. We must strive to effectively implement the goals we set ourselves in the Europe 2020 strategy. The cuts proposed by the Council to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research for small and medium-sized enterprises, or to programmes promoting the competitiveness of companies, are therefore unjustifiable. I believe that, in its position, Parliament has maintained a responsible approach to the 2012 budget, and I am convinced that efficient and balanced use of EU funds will help to revive the European economy more rapidly and will establish additional incentives for the creation of new jobs, thus producing conditions for social and economic well-being.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Europe is facing a major crisis. The 23 million unemployed, young people, entrepreneurs, people living in poor regions, are all waiting for the adoption of the EU’s 2012 budget. The Commission, the European Parliament and the Council all agree that we want a better Europe, that we want to invest in innovation, research, lifelong learning and new job creation, but our ideas diverge when it comes to approving budget items. The budget must be transparent, but it must also be ambitious. We must not skimp on investments aimed at eliminating regional differences. I am personally in favour of savings and the freezing of non-productive overhead costs, but if we want to fulfil the aims of the 2020 strategy and other programmes, such as the agenda for new skills and jobs which we are debating and approving in this plenary, the Council must also understand that the budget submitted by the Commission and approved by Parliament is a budget for the development of the whole of Europe and its people.</p>

      <p sl="el">Parliament’s position on the 2012 draft budget as modified by the Council proves that the European Parliament supports an ambitious but realistic budget for the EU. The budget proposed by the European Parliament supports investment in sectors that will strengthen and contribute towards economic growth and attainment of the EU 2020 strategy objectives through political cohesion and programmes on research, innovation, employment, the mobility of young people, energy efficiency, security of food production and food quality. It also covers emergencies that may arise inside and outside the EU via civil protection. At the same time, it takes account of the political priorities underwritten by the Union at international level, such as support for Palestine and development aid for Asia and Latin America. At times such as now, with citizens consistently facing massive problems due to the crisis, we need to join forces and use every means available at national and European level. The EU budget, with its emphasis on investment, is part of the answer to the crisis; this is a budget that will bring multiple gains to the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, simplification is sometimes extremely complicated. As rapporteurs, we have tabled a lot of amendments that are intended to standardise the rules and hopefully solve the common problems in relation to all the funds at the same time, for example, eligible costs or the determination of personnel costs. As rapporteurs, we have tried to learn from the European Union’s previous mistakes. We want to establish uniform rules in order, at least, to put an end to the multitude of different rules. We will also ensure that there is a great deal more transparency in the budget than there has been up to now. That also represents a major step towards standardisation and proximity to the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank everyone who has worked on this, first and foremost my corapporteur and the members of our working group, my fellow Members, the assistants and the many committed officials here in this House and in the Commission who have helped us. Last but not least, I would like to thank Christian Sichel, who has been my assistant for many years and right now is looking after his baby – I send my regards to him. I am indebted to my fellow Members for supporting our approach, even if that support is with varying degrees of enthusiasm.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to call on the Commission to continue on the current path towards standardisation. It would be a huge step forwards if the Commission could implement non-contradictory rules in its own institution. It has to be possible for it to do that in its own institution. That would be the greatest contribution to simplification that we and you could achieve.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today we are only voting on the report – the amendments – but not the resolution, because we have begun friendly talks with the Council, which I very much welcome. We also want to continue these friendly talks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, we have the carry-overs and the financial instruments before us, because they did not receive majority support in committee. I would like to make a strong plea for support for these amendments, which we have presented as a basis and in which we have accepted the Commission’s definitions. I would also like to make a sincere request for the amendments relating to the financial instruments for which we are presenting rules for the first time – a first definition of project bonds has been formulated – to be accepted. We are keen to link the use of financial instruments to sector-specific basic acts. We want the competent committees to discuss the use of financial instruments once again and to be able to give their opinions on this. That is the purpose of this provision.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Ms Brantner for her clarification in an oral amendment relating to Amendment 271, which makes it clear that we do not want an additional legislative act on financial instruments, but that we want to give this a sector-specific basis. I would ask for your support for Amendments 271 to 278. In these amendments, we lay down the maximum liability with regard to taxpayers’ money. We must limit the risk to European taxpayers in connection with the use of financial instruments. We owe that to taxpayers. We are establishing the Commission’s accountability. We do not want it to be possible for tax havens to be used in order to accumulate money for financial instruments. We owe that to our taxpayers, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">In two or three years’ time, we want a mid-term review of how these instruments have progressed and what conclusions we can draw from them. We also want the legal form of the instruments to be published on the Commission’s website. That will also increase transparency and ensure that we are definitely able to monitor what we have adopted. It would have been nice if the Commission had put forward these proposals itself. As you did not put them forward, we had to do so. I would therefore sincerely request that we also give them majority support here in this House. Once again, I would like to thank all my colleagues. I am pleased that we are also making good progress in connection with the forthcoming talks with the Council and that we will also be able to find solutions to what certainly are very technical and complex problems.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members and this institution, but in particular Ms Gräßle and my assistant, Davide Ruffo, for the work we have carried out. The effective implementation, management and accounting of the European Union’s budget funds are geared towards achieving the three goals of confidence, support and progress.</p>
      <p sl="it">The economic and legal basis for the Financial Regulation is today made firmer by the prospect of financial changes designed to bring about innovation in Europe through the promotion and improvement of infrastructural investments, guarantees and financial methodologies. We must spend the resources we have in the best way possible. We must invest in the sectors most likely to bring about growth and progress for Europe – a more integrated and competitive Europe with enough resources to bring shared policies to fruition and to take the lead on the international scene.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, the first task must be to stimulate public investment, private investors and the governments of individual Member States to take more courageous action in the financial and economic sphere and, within this framework of mutual cooperation, to tackle any opposition arising from democratic debate. In this sense, issuing new financial instruments represents a key aspect of the Regulation, supporting the market and the financial system of the Union and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">At a time of serious economic crisis characterised by a globalised and bipolar economy, with the increasing political and economic entrenchment of the United States on the one hand and China on the other, Europe must equip itself with new financial instruments to ensure that it is not marginalised and does not lose out. The goal is as follows: step by step, let us give Europe a level of political and economic clout that makes it capable of developing and strengthening economic ties, putting financial goals at the top of the list of Europe’s priorities. This is the only way to ensure progress and a positive future.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence, in order to implement our economic and financial growth objectives more effectively, I think it is essential to make explicit the need to keep a close eye on the effective promotion of European society. Indeed, increased spending capacity and therefore the capacity to create wealth must be carefully channelled towards concrete ends; otherwise it will not have the desired effects and will merely produce waste.</p>
      <p sl="it">Shrinking national budgets must be compensated for by funding from banks and guarantors. This would boost investment in areas where, without the EU’s support, there would be no increase in capital and no acquisition or creation of new resources for moving European industry forwards. All of that, I must underline, is not for the benefit of banks or of the wealthy but to increase a spill-over effect that can have repercussions on all levels of society.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the same way, European support for the potential losses deriving from sub-optimal investments can surely be seen as a great example of support and surety for European citizens, since we know that some large projects such as energy supply would not make sense without initial public capital.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, the key role of project bonds is undeniable. Today, they take on fresh significance through the joint decision of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Commission to start promoting private investment in infrastructure for energy, transport, information and communications. By investing in infrastructure, we can support and assist the European market and the EU’s financial system.</p>
      <p sl="it">If it does not work in an equitable way, based on mutual trust and learning from past experiences, the market cannot properly fulfil its economic function. People who ignore their past will never understand anything about the present day. This maxim is essential for us to learn from the difficulties that the old system of financial management left us with and to ask ourselves what the errors were, what did not work, how to do justice to the European market and to the economic system that binds us together and – despite the difficulties – provides us with a guiding light and a source of support for the countries that we represent today.</p>
      <p sl="it">The more we are able to look at the past, the more we can drive onwards into the future. Let us improve research, technology and innovation through support for competitiveness and innovation projects, which are particularly effective since they provide financial guarantees – which are not provided in almost all Member States – through support for projects in the research and innovation sector in which ad hoc financing systems allow for loans to be granted to individual beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of reforming Europe, we can perceive a structural solution to the crisis we have to deal with in the current economic slowdown. Unless European initiatives become more efficient and more decisive, as long as the spaces of intermediation between capital and investment are many and confused, and as long as private citizens can count on a system, we cannot count on a system that gives them guarantees, confidence and the chance to make Europe a bulwark of the world economy and for its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having reflected on the most important and innovative points of the Financial Regulation and the Multiannual Financial Framework, I should like to pose a few queries on financial instruments. I have noted the communication that the Commission published last Wednesday about financial instruments. On this subject, I would like to ask Mr Lewandowski whether or not he thinks the list currently under debate is too reductive in its enumeration of the types of financial instruments? Do you not think that perhaps it would be better to consult experts on the subject as well, such as the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, before considering expanding Articles 130 and 131 of the Financial Regulation – particularly with regard to risk-sharing instruments?</p>
      <p sl="it">Do you not think, Mr Lewandowski, that financial instruments could have a greater margin of success? What is your opinion on the basic identification of the financial instruments? Last, but by no means least, in terms of the issues identified, I would be interested to hear about the intended ways to tackle the effects of the financial crisis that will inevitably affect the economic situation in the initial years of the implementation of the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-087-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, our proposal for the new Financial Regulation was presented in May 2010, with the intention of agreeing on the rules of how to spend before discussing the volumes for the next financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the rapporteurs, Ingeborg Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, for their report on this very complex and technically very difficult dossier. I appreciate your patience in handling the issue for more than one-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the guiding principles of our proposal, they are all very much present in what is to be voted on today. By that I mean three guiding principles: simplification, pooling of resources and more accountability. Regarding simplification, this was a clear request from everybody who was present at last week’s conference, with so many stakeholders asking for the lives of the beneficiaries of our grants and funds to be made easier. Therefore, in response, we are facilitating simplification via the use of lump sums and other instruments, making it possible for the Commission to assess and determine ex ante the amounts necessary for achieving the project. That is a step towards an outward-oriented philosophy and approach in grants and also in prices. The Commission also has the same response to the overall criticism of the rules concerning recovering interest on pre-financing, which should not be due to the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are two parts, liebe Inge, to this simplification procedure. On the one hand there are beneficiaries and on the other the Commission, which is managing the budget and requesting some flexibility in the management of a budget in terms of the choice of implementing partners and not direct management. If we overburden the Commission, this also slows down the procedure and payments to the final beneficiaries. If we overburden the Commission with more reporting at a time when we are asking for a reduction of 5% in the Commission’s human resources in the coming years, this also includes the burden of reporting, which is not in line with what we see as the essential savings in the administration of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same goes for transfers and buildings, where we have amendments which we cannot support because they represent a step backwards in relation to the transition rules agreed for implementation of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding delegated acts, this is an issue of respecting the Common Understanding on Delegated Acts. I do not think the Financial Regulation is the place to settle the horizontal interinstitutional issues, but we very much welcome Parliament’s support in the area of management declarations of assurance. Now we have on the table more or less the whole picture not only of financial regulation but also regulations on cohesion and agriculture, which are the biggest areas of spending, with clear management responsibilities on the part of the Member States. We welcome the support for trust funds, making the visibility of the European Union, as the greatest donor worldwide, visible. This is simply for visibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the financial instruments which are to be standard tools in the future – not exceptional but standard, and considerably upgraded. In response to Mr Rivellini’s question, this is mainly to leverage private investment in the area of trans-European networks in energy, transport and research and development already tested. But it must longer be exceptional if we are to close the gap in transport networks in Europe. I estimate that it must be up to EUR 200 billion, with even more in energy. We have to leverage the euros spent from the European budget, and this is why we should not be limited as to the flexibility and cooperation of the European Investment Bank and the other institutions in leveraging the budget via private investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we are an honest broker for the final political agreement. I think we should make the Financial Regulation a coherent point of reference in establishing all sorts of rules for the future. We hope that we are much nearer to this goal.</p>

      <p sl="en">deputising for Ivailo Kalfin, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. − Mr President, first of all I would like to apologise as Mr Kalfin, who is our rapporteur, cannot be here, and I have to share with you his opinion, or rather our opinion in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you said, Commissioner, innovation research is directly affected by several elements of the budget: the MFF, the Financial Regulation and the annual budget. So we have to find the proper balance between the principles of financial accountability, flexibility and beneficiaries which has the greatest impact on research and development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, the overriding interpretation of the Financial Regulation in recent years has created a culture of risk avoidance and a zero trust attitude towards our participants in the research programme, which has resulted in a reduction in efficiency vis-à-vis research and innovation. Therefore the Industry Committee proposes the following polices: we need simplification, simplification, simplification, facilitation of access to grants with the aim of a greater impact on final research programmes and a specialised approach towards a tolerable risk of error rate for research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also call for the abolishment of the timesheet mechanism and for new perspectives for financing the new EU financial instruments and private public partnerships. Alongside these main requests, we have the aim of achieving more innovation, more research and development, which is the cornerstone if we want to have a more successful Europe in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur most sincerely for her sacrificial and very often thankless work, which nevertheless has brought tangible results.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation of recipients of EU funds at home and abroad is not always simple. I am convinced that the position we are adopting today will simplify the lives of these people to a certain degree. I would like briefly to mention five points from the area of foreign policy where the situation will improve.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we are also enabling flexible funds for the prevention of armed conflicts, in other words wars. Up to now, the EU has been able to release flexible funds as soon as a country has declared itself to be in a state of crisis. Declaring a country to be in a state of crisis does not usually make sense from a political point of view, because then the country really is already on its way down that road. For the purpose of prevention, it would be helpful to be able to do this one step earlier. That will now be possible – a real improvement in conflict prevention, which is, of course, usually significantly more favourable than what happens once it has already reached the stage of war.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, with regard to development aid, the question of VAT will make life easier for a lot of people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I think it is important that we are calling for a separate budget line for all EU missions – this is something that we have been calling for for a long time, but it is nevertheless important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, we also have greater transparency, not only in respect of the recipients, but also in respect of the actual aim of the project funded. That is particularly important in the area of foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, in the area of foreign policy we give a great deal of money to international organisations. We are now demanding to know, at the end of the process, how much money has been given to each organisation. That will also increase transparency.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the nature of the document we are debating at the moment means that it has not attracted much interest from the recipients of Union funds or from the media. We very often discuss how much money there will be, but we talk comparatively less often about how we are going to spend that money and how we are going to account for it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For the Committee on Regional Development, completion of work on this regulation is particularly important, because we are in the process of preparing for work on new regulations. The relation between what is known as the financial regulation and regulations on particular funds is a direct one, and it will undoubtedly be much easier if certain questions concerning, for example, accreditation, control and reporting have been settled before completion of work on regulations on the Structural Funds. In a word, it is a regulation which is extremely important for cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, my first words must be to congratulate our rapporteurs, Ms Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, as well as the rapporteurs for the groups, who have all done important work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first thing I want to mention is simplification, and I would like to thank both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for having moved towards simplification. Both citizens and central and local government bodies are at the end of their tether. Every time we see an increase in the error rate, it is because the rules are too complicated. I warmly thank you, therefore, for the Cohesion Fund resources, and for the research that has been done, continuing on from Mr Carvalho’s excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for having agreed to introduce a measure of consistency, by allowing the use of international accounting standards applicable to the public sector in future. We had to put an end to this inconsistency whereby the EU’s accountants made their own rules. Thank you also for having looked into shortening the timescale for granting discharge. It is only given after 16 months, which is far too long.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will end by mentioning two other subjects. The first is the national declarations: I have a lot of reservations about these. I believe we ought to discuss the matter from both the political and technical points of view, to make sure that these declarations are in keeping with international auditing standards applicable to the public sector. In auditing, we never ask for declarations of assurance from managing authorities. We ask them for representation letters stating that nothing has been concealed, but not letters of assurance. It is not the job of ministers to perform audits. What is more, in the Member States that have agreed to the principle, the error rates are no lower than in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I would like to thank the committees for having agreed to the principle of an investment section within the European Union, in order to keep investment operations separate. We will at last be able to have a budget framework for our major investment projects, such as GALILEO or ITER, which are planned over periods that go well beyond the annual framework, or even the financial perspective. Another significant step forward that is within sight in terms of budget presentation is the inclusion of the future project bonds in our accounting system, and the establishment of a major European investment plan to help growth within the Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course also appropriate at this point for we shadow rapporteurs to express our thanks and appreciation to the two rapporteurs from this House. They delved so deeply into the subject that sometimes we could no longer see them. My compliments on this splendid work.</p>
      <p sl="de">In connection with the Financial Regulation, we are also discussing Article 56, which deals with shared management. In the European Union, that is particularly important in regional policy and represents the second largest budget area. It represents the acid test for whether the Member States really are serious about the prudent use of EU funds, about which we have heard so much in the budget debates this morning.</p>
      <p sl="de">We see that, since 1994, there has been a total of more than EUR 7 billion in financial corrections in this area. We also see that, in 2010 alone, there was more than EUR 250 million in repayments to the EU budget – funds that were misspent in the Member States. At this point, I would like once again to recall the fact that EUR 250 million is more than the European Parliament wants to mobilise by means of the Flexibility Instrument. All I can say, Mr Dominik, is that when you next visit in the Council, please convey a message from the Committee on Budgets: we want our money back!</p>
      <p sl="de">What has been proposed in terms of audits and better control procedures in the Financial Regulation within the framework of Article 56 will help in this regard. I will be interested to see how the Council responds to this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to start by complimenting the rapporteurs on their diligent work. The position taken by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is that the Commission should be responsible for the implementation of the budget and that the Council and Parliament should not try to micro-manage. We place our confidence in the Commission and we do not wish to interfere too much with the details. Control will come afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For the ALDE Group, the main issue so far has been that we adhere to an earlier provision of the Interinstitutional Agreement, that Member States are required to submit a discharge statement every year. Up until now, that has proved to be almost a dead letter and we find that most regrettable. We will insist that it again be included in the Financial Regulation and, this time, it will be a key point for the ALDE Group.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another point of debate: do we need to introduce a tolerable risk of error? The ALDE Group is of the opinion that we do not. We need to stick to the standards and, if the implementation of the budget becomes too complicated and too expensive to check, then we should not introduce it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for the last few years the EU auditors have been saying that a large proportion of the irregularities are due to complex rules. This recast of the Financial Regulation was meant primarily to solve that problem. While this proposal is a long way from achieving that goal, what worries me most is that it fails to include fundamental aspects of control. Why does it exclude the demand for an annual treasury audit when this function is at the core of the management of taxpayers’ money? Such an audit would reveal the failures of the system to prevent, detect and control any misappropriation of EU funding. However, since my time as chief accounting officer of the European Commission, I have seen such important and basic procedures dismissed. I will not vote in favour of any regulation that does not include fundamental control procedures that strengthen the Commission’s responsibility regarding taxpayers’ funds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteurs. This has been very complex, as the Commissioner has said, particularly because it has been a dossier handled by two committees at Parliament: the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control. As the S&amp;D coordinator of the Budgets Committee, I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their fruitful cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group has sometimes been a bit difficult for the rapporteurs: we have made problems for them, but it has been for a good cause, because we have to use this opportunity to move forward. We have to find the proper balance between, on the one hand, control, proper spending, and so on, and, on the other hand, swift implementation and a reasonable level of complexity for end users, for citizens. And most of all we must focus on results.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are afraid to repeat historical mistakes, but now is the time to move forward. We must recognise that the most important thing is ensuring that EU spending has a real effect on the economies of the Member States and citizens. That is why we are so insistent on the issue of simplification.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the proposed revision of the regulation on budgetary rules for the EU following the entry into effect of the Treaty of Lisbon should bring greater transparency, as well as a simplification of the administrative and financial rules. It is extremely important, for example, for the evaluation of research funding to be based not only on the type of research involved, but also whether the research accords with the fundamental values of the EU, the protection of human rights and above all the protection of human dignity. The evaluation must also be carried out in accordance with the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case of Oliver Brüstle v Greenpeace, which bans the patenting of discoveries in areas where the basic principles guaranteeing human dignity and integrity are not respected, and in which the court emphasised that this protection also applies to the human body in any stage of its formation or development, including embryo cells.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the plan to recast the Financial Regulation of the European Union in light of the Treaty of Lisbon responds to a number of a clear and well-defined requirements. These include the need to favour investments of such a quality as to stimulate competitiveness and the need to introduce and beef up shared policies, which will help ensure an increasingly leading role for Europe in investment and territorial cohesion processes.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also think it also offers a robust response to the need for simplification being heard around the continent, where European regulations often cannot be comprehended or fully implemented. Public investments must be used increasingly both to encourage private investment and to stimulate national governments to provide fresh impetus through new financial instruments.</p>

The Commission believes that the legislative resolution should be postponed in order to find additional time for negotiations and explanations on this difficult topic.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for this debate. I would have liked also to have heard something more from the Council. It is a shame, but I am sure that we will have another opportunity to exchange views. Commissioner Lewandowski, at no time during any of the work did I forget that every day 14 000 workers in the Union have to take the rule book that is the Financial Regulation in their hands and work with it. For that reason, we are in agreement that this text clearly needs a comprehensive tidy-up. It needs to be streamlined and also made easier to understand. I would like the Commission to play a more active role in the negotiations than it has done up to now. We need the Commission, because we need to solve a great many problems relating to the details.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like once again to make a commitment to simplification. We want simplification, but our problem is the following: you are familiar with these tables. It is the multitude of different rules in the Framework Programme for Research. This diversity of rules was created by the Commission itself. I am sure that even the Commission has learnt from this in recent years. However, we simply must ensure that we take a much more coherent approach with regard to the next funds. Admittedly, in this regard we have sometimes also put forward complicated proposals. I have to say, though, that three quarters of our proposals are taken from the Commission’s texts themselves. I am now astonished to hear that the Commission’s texts are not supposed to be perfect, which I really cannot believe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I look forward to the negotiations and I would also like to assure my colleagues from the committees concerned – the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Regional Development – that we have taken your concerns on board and we are taking them very seriously. We will not merely accept them here and then forget about them, but will bring them very specifically into the negotiations and we will fight for them, as the Council has already experienced to its cost in the part of the last sitting that was devoted to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. We are one Parliament, and we also want everyone’s views to be reflected in this text, because everyone wants to play a part in improving the current situation. Therefore, Mr Geier, take heart. I know that you and your group are concerned that we are disappearing into the abyss of the Financial Regulation and you alone will remain behind. We would like to take you with us. So, I ask you: come to my office. I would like very much to explain the entire matter to you in around three hours.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the report tabled on the financial regulation today, which should be strongly supported for the following three reasons. First, the essential need to simplify rules for the end user – particularly SMEs. Rule simplification should also apply to researchers where time sheets for their work should not be required. Second, encouraging steps towards national accountability for the EU funds put at their disposal in order to finally achieve a European Statement of Assurance, sadly lacking today.

      <p sl="cs">Ms Gräßle completed a huge piece of work last month, with a whole series of specific and highly positive results in the form of visible changes during the review of the Union’s financial Bible, the financial regulation. The main purpose of this new proposal is to simplify and reorganise the financial regulation by creating a simple legal instrument combining the principles and basic rules of budgetary and financial management. The new financial regulation of the EU should clarify EU expenditure, make it transparent and provide greater reassurance for users of European funds. The new draft emphasises that better financial management in the EU must be supported by careful monitoring of developments by the Commission and the Member States, and therefore insists that Member States should assume responsibility for the proper use and administration of funds, issuing regular annual national reports on the use of EU funds at the appropriate political level through a so-called national declaration.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The implementation of the financial rules applicable to the annual budget of the Union must comply with ruling C-34/10 of the European Court of Justice. It ruled that human life starts at conception and that the human embryo is worthy of legal protection. The Court writes: ‘Any human ovum after fertilisation, any non-fertilised human ovum into which the cell nucleus from a mature human cell has been transplanted, and any non-fertilised human ovum whose division and further development have been stimulated by parthenogenesis constitute a “human embryo”.’ The Court points out that the EU legislator has sought to exclude any possibility of patenting so long as respect for human dignity could be jeopardised. This ruling must be fully applied immediately to the research projects financed by the current EU budget, including with a view to the programming of the Eighth Research Framework Programme. I call on the Commission to submit a draft framework programme which focuses on the ethical alternatives of fundamental research. Many examples of serious scientific research prove that biomedical research is possible without using human embryos. Europe can be proud of its capacity for competitive scientific research that respects universal ethical principles.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today’s vote on the budget represents another lost opportunity for this Parliament to show it is in tune with the electorate. All over Europe Member States are making painful but necessary cuts to their budgets; they are aiming to end waste and make their finances sustainable. The Council position went some way to reflect this reality but as usual this Parliament disregarded our taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fear that Members in this Chamber are not yet fully aware of the serious and precarious position that Europe finds itself in. More Europe is not the cure. We should lower the burden on taxations and, where Europe does spend money, it should do so to increase competitiveness. I fear that we have failed our citizens again.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget sets out a few clear and important objectives within the scope of the Europe 2020 strategy; for this I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes. It is essential to focus on investments and not merely on the careful management of the budget. The only alternative is to look on passively at the speculative way of thinking that dominates at present.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can no longer allow ourselves to follow individual interests and instead must finally act as a single, united structure, ready to face up to confrontation. I welcome the commitments adopted on the pilot projects and the preparatory actions in Heading 2, just as I welcome the fact that funding for the Integrated Maritime Policy is not to the detriment of other initiatives and programmes in the fisheries sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">This will allow us to implement policies for better marine resource management, through research and thoroughgoing exchange of data on fish stocks, bringing in new planning methods in the Adriatic area that can be used as best practices in other marine areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will conclude with a quick aside: with regard to future debates on the common fisheries policy (CFP) and in particular on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), I hope that a greater effort will be made on fisheries control, which is at the heart of the fight against illegal fishing and is also a key issue in restoring stocks. Fish should be seen as a shared asset.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this text on the budget certainly brings together some highly significant issues, including without doubt the central role of the Mediterranean. Further resources for neighbourhood relations with the areas that border southern Europe can serve to assist and promote this push for freedom, which is still being fully expressed, including through free elections, like those that took place in Tunisia last Sunday.</p>
      <p sl="it">All this must be done through priorities that provide a further chance for development and competiveness for the benefit of many young migrants in those very areas, better border protection, more resources for Frontex, and a more decisive European strategy to combat organised crime. Just yesterday, the first report on mafias and organised crime was adopted. By seizing this additional opportunity, Parliament is sending out an important message that it will rightly and vigorously combat these very serious problems.</p>

Firstly, I consider it to be appropriate and proportionate given the difficult economic situation throughout the European Union. Secondly, we have made savings, particularly in our own budget in this House. Thirdly, I expressly support the proposal by my group, which wants the House of European History, but of course also wants an overall financing plan, a project, to be submitted in order to then decide what form this House of European History is to take.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today I voted against the budget for 2012. Member States around Europe are having to cut their budgets and reduce their deficit. Our voters are having to accept real austerity measures, as my colleague Ashley Fox pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, Parliament could have shown more willingness to share the burden with our citizens by cutting further. We could have first looked at our own budget and administration, and we should have considered supporting a freeze on MEPs’ allowances, including our daily allowance. I am pleased that Parliament voted to look at travel costs and cuts and reductions in business flights. These are examples of things that do not impact on the quality of MEPs’ work. We could have shown some leadership and solidarity with our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament should have supported the Council cuts as well those proposed under certain areas of the cohesion policy, given that there are major underspends in these budget headings. I had hoped that my colleagues could today have sent a clearer and stronger signal to EU citizens telling them that we are in the same boat and committed to shouldering the burden of the crisis with them. It was a missed opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am against the report on the EU budget because it does not deal with the urgent tasks that are posed by the economic crisis, the consequences of which are devastating for working class people and young people across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once more we have a budget for a big-business and militarised Europe, with more money being spent on security than on education, and, incredibly, a proposal to increase the amount of funding for the nuclear research programme, despite the increased opposition to nuclear power across Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">At the same time there are no cuts to the obscenely large expenses which are granted to MEPs. I signed an amendment proposing to cut the general expenditure allowance, which is EUR 4 299 per month. As MEPs know – but perhaps many members of the public do not – that is only one of a whole series of large expenses that go on top of an already very fat salary. The same overpaid MEPs that are calling on underpaid working-class people to tighten their belts further, to accept more vicious austerity, show no indication of being willing to tighten their own belts.</p>

      <p sl="it">I completely agree with Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes and therefore voted in favour of the resolution. The crisis must not be tackled solely through austerity measures, but also through investment in research and in the cohesion policy. Administrative costs must be kept in check and Parliament has sent out a clear and firm message on this.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the 2012 EU budget amounting to EUR 147.766 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 133.143 billion in payment appropriations is sensibly balanced and takes account of the need to achieve the agreed EU objectives set out, among other places, in the Europe 2020 strategy. This will support an intelligent, sustainable and inclusive economy, contributing to job creation. I firmly believe that Europe now needs an investment budget, particularly for economic recovery and the development of individual Member State regions and towns, emphasising that not even 5.6% is earmarked for the actual running of EU institutions, and I am pleased that the contribution for the general expenditure of the European Parliament is frozen at the 2011 level, and that the budget update of Parliament for 2012 is just 1.44 times that of 2011, which is the lowest update for the past 12 years. I therefore support the proposal to take exact account of actual needs, in order to achieve the agreed objectives and political commitments of the Union, and to ensure the smooth running of the priority programmes, which clearly includes cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="it">The motion we adopted today, with a definite vote in favour on our part, is without doubt effective and well suited to the pursuit of two things: rigour and development. We also need to see rigour from Parliament and on the costs of running the institutions. Development should be achieved through actions that go beyond our intimations and aim to improve employment levels and above all to solicit investments that will contribute to growth, stimulating private investors to take action.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, it is clear, in such economically tough times as those we are living through at present in the European Union, and in which, in many Member States, there are budget deficits and deficit spending, that we also need a strict and accountable economic policy here. In that respect, it is good that there is to be some pruning in this budget, and that is the way we must proceed. It will boost confidence. We have to take account of the existing situation and establish our own responsible approach. It is also important to remember that a responsible policy also entails the search for new growth areas.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now is the time to invest in sources of growth, which include innovation, research, product development and education and training. It is worth noting that, in this budget, more resources are being put into these areas than before, because we need new innovations and new activity in that area, so that we can get through the economic recession.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I have two small observations to make. In my opinion, cutting interpreting services is extremely worrying as far as the small languages are concerned. However, personally, I have to say that on Amendment 21 in paragraph 29 of the third section of the report by Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, I unfortunately followed my group’s line and voted yes, although I should have voted no. I therefore want to put this right. I am against the proposal put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, whilst I can agree with our rapporteur and those parts of his report that say we should fight tax evasion, I must fundamentally disagree with his whole approach to the common system of taxation. This report was meant to be a simple recast of the original directive but, as ever, in the spirit of ever-closer political union that so many in this Chamber seem to want, the left of this Parliament have seen fit to add all sorts of substantive amendments which actually mean that this legislation goes much further than originally intended.</p>
      <p sl="en">These amendments pave the way for a common consolidated corporate tax rate in the European Union, and in my view this is completely unacceptable. Member States must retain tax sovereignty when defining their corporate tax rate, because tax competitiveness is vital for the growth of our single market. That is why I voted against this report and why I will continue to vote against any report that puts tax sovereignty at risk.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current pressure to comply with the European Stability and Growth Pact, by cutting Member States’ budgets in order to stay within the permitted sovereign debt and government deficit percentages, means that the recast we are debating in Parliament today takes on particular significance.</p>
      <p sl="it">The debate over this issue has often seen heated discussions, including in the Council. Since this is a proposal for a recast, no major changes are being made to the current directive except for the amendments to Article 4. Despite being made in what is probably the irrelevant context of a recast proposal, these amendments pose a major query with regard to the ongoing discussion on strengthening the internal market and consolidating public finances.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also voted in favour of this measure, Mr President, because the amendments proposed by Mr Giegold risked putting the founding principles of the directive itself under debate, through a de facto reintroduction of a dividend tax while also tackling the issue of the need for greater coordination – if not harmonisation – on corporate tax, to avoid the benefits of the internal market turning out to be used for fiscal planning, with negative consequences for public finances.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I was very pleased to vote in favour of this report by Ms Gräßle for two reasons. Firstly, this report states that, in principle, we want to pay out the funds for approved eligible projects within one month. That will make things considerably easier, particularly for small authorities. They will be pleased about that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I am also very pleased that with this report we have now managed to ensure – and I hope that we can also implement this – that in future, too, the Commission will report the details of the personnel costs of individual support programmes, as that will reveal the proportion of the support programmes that goes on administration. Only once we have the data and can analyse the figures can we actually make the appropriate improvements.</p>

      <p sl="it">Among the reasons for this broad support, I feel I must underline the core points of this measure, which look at investment quality, at the ability to stimulate competitiveness and above all at bringing in and bolstering common policies that will contribute to ensuring a leading role for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">This new regulation gives Europe a greater role in the existing development projects in our territory, partly by simplifying rules and regulations, which is something we have been begged for, particularly by local agencies which often have a great deal of trouble accessing the opportunities made available by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, this historic period and the economic problems that Europe is currently negotiating require greater planning to support employment, in line with the Europe 2020 objectives. We must remember that among the shocking statistics being reported by the Member State economies – including unemployment rates nearing 10% and double that in youth unemployment – the tourism sector is one of the few to have withstood the global crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, as we also reiterated in our own-initiative report, we need to work with the social partners and the tourism industry to develop a proper outline of tourism sector skills, which will help us to work out new workers’ skills and prospects for targeted professional training.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must focus on training and professional qualifications through major investment in new professional roles that are more inclined towards enterprise and management, so as to attract the new flows of tourists from emerging nations. To this end, we should integrate national measures with European Social Fund resources for professional training.</p>
      <p sl="it">On top of all this, there needs to be an even greater effort to ensure employment quality in a sector that survives on seasonal work and, unfortunately, on too much undeclared work as well. I voted in favour of the report partly for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I too welcome the vote on this report, even though a few points might well have been developed a little further.</p>
      <p sl="it">Reflecting on all the regionalisation and localisation of employment contracts cannot, however, fail to take heed of the important task of unifying workers’ rights. In other words, the greater the opportunity to develop territorial, business and sectoral autonomy to stimulate productivity and create the conditions for competitiveness, the greater the need to create the conditions for some fundamental rights to be applied on a supranational, or European, basis.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why I am still puzzled as to whether this initiative could lead us to tackle the important issue of whether there can be a European policy on fundamental rights. Otherwise the alternative is that we will enter what I think will be a bad period in which there will be rich and poor workers, even though they are doing the same job.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the economic crisis that has affected labour markets since 2008 has caused the loss of 5.6 million jobs. That is why we need to reinforce human capital by updating skills and linking education and training more closely with work, just as we need to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and on young people joining the world of work. There is, however, one point that baffles me, on which my group tabled two amendments that were rejected by this House. For this reason, my concerns remain and I did not support the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">This point in question relates to the way the single contract was presented by the Commission. The contract does not offer adequate legal guarantees or rights on working conditions, social security and the protection of workers under all types of contract. I maintain that the issue of the right to work and the right to social security is a very important point.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, as well as seeking to remedy its mistakes, Europe must also start investing in its future again. We have set ourselves an ambitious target: 75% employment for the 20-64 age group by 2020. However, just as it is inconceivable that only public expenditure will drive new investment for growth, there will be no new jobs if we do not stimulate private investment in innovative sectors and youth hiring; if more training - better training - is not carried out; if budget, fiscal, pensions and welfare policies are not harmonised across the EU; and if the labour market is not made to be more flexible, making contract negotiations more in tune with and proximate to the needs of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, while also respecting fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">My vote in favour of the report by Ms Bastos is an act of faith in the EU institutions and in their ability – albeit late in the day – to pull the leading world economy out of the crisis without distorting the European social model. At the same time, however, the institutions must succeed in releasing the hidden energy reserves in Europe’s economy, which are hindered from reaching their potential and contributing to the much-needed growth of the European economy and the resolution of the sovereign debt crisis by bureaucratic inflexibility, the labour market and dumping within Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for the report drafted by Ms Bastos because it deals with a topic which is crucial to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the adoption of this text is especially timely as we also voted on the Ungureanu report yesterday. Workers’ mobility is an important factor for the single market and for the success of the Agenda for new skills and jobs. At the same time, it is the best solution for ensuring that positions requiring high qualifications are occupied. For example, more than 8 000 doctors have left Romania alone in the last four years, which has an adverse effect on us, but meets the needs in other European Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the emphasis placed on simplifying the procedures for recognising professional qualifications.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the main consequence of the economic, financial and social crisis is the fall in job numbers. Europe has lost 5.6 million jobs since 2008. The fact that a significant proportion of the unemployed are young people under the age of 30 is very alarming. If a young person does not start work after completing an apprenticeship or university, his knowledge and skills disappear and he starts to be gradually excluded from society. This situation makes it impossible to start a family properly and encourage his children to work, and to take on financial responsibility for his parents or grandparents later on. I would like to emphasise that it is essential to review the system of secondary education. In many EU countries, education produces hundreds of thousands of universally educated secondary school pupils for whom there is no work, while demand continues for traditional crafts and the European market faces a long-term shortage of craftsmen. The submitted report includes largely appropriate measures aimed at increasing employment in Europe, and I have therefore voted in favour of its adoption.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, as underlined in the excellent report by Ms Bastos, Europe needs to take some incisive decisions to modernise the labour market, improving above all its flexibility and security. We must ensure dignified working conditions for all, improve current legislation and provide workers and businesses with the right incentives to adapt to the new requirements of the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Yet in order to adopt effective policies, the ability to forecast and anticipate future needs must be improved. Today more than ever, high-quality education and training are essential requirements for providing the new skills that the market demands. If we want to get back on our feet after this serious economic crisis, become more competitive and achieve higher levels of growth and employment, we must make better use of all our potential and focus on young people. They are our future and we cannot allow ourselves to neglect or hold back their professional advancement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, have voted in favour of this agenda. It is part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the aim of which is to achieve an employment level of 75% for everyone between the ages of 20 and 64 by 2020. In August 2011, the level of unemployment in the EU 27 was 9.5%, with the level of youth unemployment being 20.4% and in some Member States even 40%. That is simply too high. Unemployment means not only missed opportunities, but also wasted intellectual skills and resources for our society. In view of the fact that 85% of jobs in the European Union are provided by small and medium-sized enterprises, I expressly support the Commission’s proposal to promote entrepreneurship and innovation and to promote the setting up of new businesses and development in order in this way to be able to shape the economy in a more dynamic and innovative way.</p>

      <p sl="it">The text by Ms Bastos emphasises that to make genuine progress we need to link education and training more closely with the labour market, together with policies designed to ensure a better supply-demand fit on the labour market.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, across Europe the rate of unemployment has remained static at extremely high percentages. This demonstrates that Europe as a whole has not yet escaped the crisis that has tormented it since 2008. In October, unemployment in the euro area reached 9.7%. Meanwhile in Italy, according to the Italian statistics bureau ISTAT, the unemployment rate remained at 8.7%, as youth unemployment – our future – increased, rising as high as 27.6%, an increase of 2.4% since November 2009, and peaking at 40% in some regions, like southern Italy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final shocking statistic is that the minimal employment growth we are seeing is only among men. Once again, women lag far behind. The policies that each Member State is trying to put in place to overcome this prolonged period of crisis result in a slowdown in the labour market. This alarming situation requires strong answers, which the agenda presented to us by the Commission does offer, with effective solutions that can be rapidly put into action. That is why I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, unemployment in the European Union is a severe problem and one which is causing much concern. Several good measures have been put forward in this report for reducing unemployment, above all unemployment among young people. Nevertheless, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, during the current parliamentary term, we have on more than one occasion considered various strategies and proposals for reducing unemployment, such as creating ‘green’ jobs, promoting youth employment and tackling employment issues faced by individual social groups. If all the proposals mentioned were implemented, instead of being put on the back burner, I believe that by 2015 the European Union would achieve the goals set in 2010. While congratulating the rapporteur on the proposals made, I would therefore also draw attention to the fact that we above all need better coordination of the implementation of measures that have already been approved which would both help to reduce unemployment and save funds for other priorities.</p>

Besides this, it will also be necessary to respond to the major challenges facing both the Union itself and the Member States. The EU budget will play a key role, as it will have a stimulating effect on Member State strategies aimed at economic recovery, and this will ultimately have an effect on the final beneficiaries.

I am opposed to any form of transfer of resources from the 7th Framework Programme, as proposed by the Commission in its group of proposals for financing ITER, as this would threaten the successful implementation of the 7th Framework Programme. Apart from this, I support an increase in the funding for commitments relating to selected items from the 7th Framework Programme (building up capacity – research benefitting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), cooperation - energy sector, ideas, people, research in the field of energy), because in my opinion these items are an instrument ensuring growth and investment in key areas that are of central importance to the Europe 2020 strategy.

The EU has also set for itself a number of ambitious objectives for 2020. Section 1a is particularly important to achieving these objectives and restoring economic growth.

Research and innovation are the two key pillars of economic development and job creation in Europe.

Unfortunately, yet again, the draft Union budget is being held ransom to the major interests promoted by overriding EU policies. Spending on defence policies exceeds spending on education and more money has been earmarked for large enterprises than for small and medium-sized enterprises. Also, this specific budget channels more resources to international pharmaceutical companies than to research in that sector. The draft Union budget, together with the austerity programmes applied in the Member States, is slowing down growth and exacerbating the recession. In light of this, I voted against this particular report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would congratulate Mr Fernandes on his excellent work as rapporteur for the 2012 budget of the European Parliament. With this budget, Parliament can modernise and live up to its responsibilities in a context of economic and financial crisis, and of need to set an example in cost cutting. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it has more responsibility and an increased workload, particularly in legislative processes, with the increase in the number of trialogues and conciliations. In view of this, I welcome: 1.- the overall EUR 74 million cut concerning the draft budget tabled by the Secretary-General, 2.- the reduced real value of the 2012 budget compared with 2011; the last reduction in Parliament’s budgets on this scale was 15 years ago, 3.- the freezing of the Members’ general expenditure allowance at 2011 levels, 4.- the recommendation not to increase Members’ allowances in line with inflation, 5.- the 5% cut in travel allowances. I deplore the use of the budget process for petty politics. It is easy to make Parliament’s spending controversial by looking at a given sum out of context. However, that strengthens neither Parliament nor democracy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In order to mobilise the potential offered by the EU’s economies with the aim of bringing about economic recovery in the wake of the crisis, measures need to be taken to stimulate recovery in the short term, strengthen sustainable economic growth, promote the stability of the financial market and reinforce economic governance structures. At the same time, support must be given to the projects dealing with vulnerable groups, especially young people, and aimed at providing them with access to the labour market and education. This must be one of the measures to address the high youth unemployment rate and the social tensions in an ever-increasing number of countries. In addition, a financial transaction tax must be established globally, with the aim of financing the eradication of poverty. On the subject of EU development policy, I would like to point out that, if Member States fail to come up with new sources of funding, they will not be able to fulfil their Millennium Development Goal commitments for 2015. In this regard, I find unacceptable the Council’s proposal to reduce the credits for development cooperation instruments by EUR 70 million and the attempt to reallocate the existing funds earmarked for development to resolve some new political challenges, such as climate change and the Arab Spring, which must be funded from additional resources.</p>

      <p sl="fr">While the European agriculture ministers have, yet again, failed to find a solution to maintaining the European Food Aid Programme, an amendment calling for the maintenance of the budgetary envelope allocated to this programme has been adopted with broad support by the European Parliament. If any programme deserves support, it is quite clearly the Food Aid Programme. Unfortunately, despite the support of the European Parliament, the European Commission, the great majority of Member States and the mobilisation of associations on the ground, six Member States (Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Sweden) continue to oppose this and to stand in the way of any solution. This is unacceptable. At the current time, the very least we can do is to guarantee annual funding of EUR 480 million. There are ways out of the deadlock: the European Commission has proposed that we use the food surpluses of the CAP and we purchase supplementary food from the market as a temporary measure, on the legal basis of social cohesion. We expect Europe’s leaders to assume their duty of solidarity. The Food Aid Programme’s future must be assured. Any other solution would be unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for the resolution on the draft 2012 budget. I believe that, in the current context of crisis and resulting austerity measures, the European Parliament should join Europeans with the efforts demanded of them, specifically by freezing all allowances for Members and cutting Members’ spending on travel. However, I regret the decision to make cuts to translation and interpretation, since the principle of multilingualism in the European Parliament and within the framework of inter-institutional dialogue must not be called into question. That is why I voted for Amendments 43 and 44. Although I believe we should have gone further with reducing and rationalising spending, I should like to stress that administrative costs account for only 5.6% of the total EU budget and that the European Parliament budget represents only one fifth of that total. On the other hand, the 2012 budget for the European Parliament will be below inflation, so it is making significant spending cuts despite the new Members and the new responsibilities resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="sv">It is important that the EU takes the same responsibility for making savings and improving efficiency that the Member States are having to do during this time of economic crisis. Even EU politicians need to make savings. We have therefore been working to get the MEPs’ mission allowances and other allowances frozen. We have also been campaigning for savings within the area of MEPs’ travel costs, and we welcome the large saving that is now being made within the European Parliament. However, we believe that more could have been done to reduce Parliament’s costs. In particular, we regret the fact that we cannot put an end to travelling to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the same time, it is also important for a reasonable investment rate to be maintained, so that Europe remains competitive in the future, too. Now more than ever we need to invest for jobs and growth – research, development, climate and training. We are also keen for the payments from the EU’s budget to be maintained at an adequate level. Reducing these payments would put an end to several Structural Fund and research projects that have already been decided on. The EU must be able to pay its accounts. We would, however, have welcomed further savings by means of a reduction in EU agricultural aid. We voted against additional aid for the EU’s vegetable producers and believe, in particular, that the EU’s export, tobacco and alcohol subsidies should be abolished.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We also believe that the EU has an important role to play in the democratisation process in North Africa following the Arab Spring.

      <p sl="pt">The crisis in which the European Union is mired and which is jeopardising its stability makes it advisable that the EU budget take into account the difficulties being experienced and resist expansionist tendencies, which would be misunderstood by public opinion in the Member States. I believe the EU general budget for the financial year 2012 has sought to take this concern into account without succumbing to easy populism. It should be noted, for example, that the budget set out for Parliament has been reduced by EUR 74 million, in spite of the additional costs that the institution has been facing. I hope the Union will be able to exercise its competences and will be able to do more, and do it better, with less, despite the budget cuts demanded by the severity of the current situation. If it does this, and I hope it will, it will set a good example to the Member States, in particular those currently experiencing the greatest difficulties.

      <p sl="pt">The total cost of all the administrative and operating costs of all the European institutions represents only 5.59% of the grand total of the European Union budget. It should also be stressed that we have surpassed expectations for the Council, the Commission and Parliament, as shown by the margin of EUR 500 million in Heading 5. This was managed in spite of new responsibilities, new Members of this House and the establishment of new institutions, such as the European External Action Service. The overall increase in the 2012 budget for all of the institutions is about 1%, far below inflation, meaning there is negative growth in their budgets in real terms. With regard to Parliament’s budget, we have cut more than EUR 74 million between the start of negotiations with the Bureau of the European Parliament and now. If we are to be thorough and make a comparison with 2011, we have to remove expenditure arising from Croatia’s accession and the entry of the 18 new Members, which results in one of the lowest increases in the history of this Parliament: only 0.8%. It should be noted that we have saved EUR 21 million on interpretation and translation alone. We have also approved a 5% cut in all types of travel.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As the rapporteurs say, the cuts proposed by the Council and Commission – around EUR 1.59 billion (-1.08%) in commitments and EUR 3.65 billion (-2.75%) in payments – from an overall budget, which was already extremely meagre in itself, are regrettable. However, this accusing rhetoric directed at the Council by a Parliament that then ends up backing a budget not much different – in total and in choices – from the one presented to it is, unfortunately, becoming a habit. This is a budget that is lower than previous years in real and percentage terms, which is regrettable and, in the current context of profound crisis, illustrates the true meaning of Europe’s much-vaunted solidarity. This, moreover, in a year in which – in budgetary terms too – the EU is facing enlargement to a new Member State.</p>

In supporting investment and actions aimed at boosting growth and employment in 2012, the EU will build on the principles set out in the new framework created in an effort to revive the economy and strengthen economic governance. Besides this, it will also be necessary to respond to the major challenges facing both the Union itself and the Member States. The EU budget will play a key role, as it will have a stimulating effect on Member State strategies aimed at economic recovery, and this will ultimately have an effect on the final beneficiaries.

      <p sl="en">One illustrating example is the interpretation services in Strasbourg. Our meetings in Strasbourg last until midnight and require ongoing interpretation services.

Savings, and yet more savings. Except for the European Union, which wants a budget increase of 4.9%, and the European Parliament, which wants one of 5.2%. What do they want it for? Are they thinking of slashing the staffing of national civil services and then employing European civil servants? Or sprinkling some funds here and there to pretend to support employment, while pursuing policies that systematically destroy it? Or spending increasing amounts of money on communication to let it be known what a good idea Europe is, without ever advancing any serious explanation why? Why should they bother? The Member States are the ones who have to put their hands in their pockets. If this budget were to be adopted, the French contribution to the European budget would increase by EUR 1.3 billion.

I believe that we should also address the objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as identified by the Europe 2020 strategy. Agricultural expenditure in the Union budget is rather rigid, given its predictability and the fact that, where direct payments are concerned, full correspondence is mandatory between commitments and payments and that such payments account for at least 70 % of the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget, so that any variations are mainly linked to market distortion. The promotion of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy which creates jobs and high-quality employment by delivering on the Europe 2020 strategy's seven flagship initiatives is a jointly endorsed goal of the 27 Member States and the EU institutions.

      <p sl="de">The 2012 budget may include the lowest budget for the European Parliament’s own expenditure for 15 years, but there would still be sufficient potential for more savings here, particularly with regard to the travel circus between Brussels and Strasbourg. It is also high time that a selective thinning out was performed on the proliferation of EU agencies in order to make more potential savings. It is disgraceful that even the combating of fraud and the recovery of European funds erroneously paid out does not actually work properly. The report calls for an increase of 5.2%, which would increase the EU budget next year to EUR 133.1 billion. Particularly during a time of financial, economic and debt crisis, that sends out a disturbing signal. The Member States are tightening their belts and have also had austerity reforms imposed on them from EU level, but the EU budget is nevertheless to increase. I voted against this report, which is once again an example of us not practising what we preach.</p>

      <p sl="it">The text on the 2012 budget which we voted for today undoubtedly represents a solid basis for the conciliation with the Council which will need to take place shortly. In this regard, it would be advisable for the Council not merely to propose linear cuts, as it has done so far, but instead to indicate negative priorities on which we can take decisive action.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are various budget lines for non-core actions on which we could intervene right now; it is true, for example, that Europe’s administrative and bureaucratic apparatus is certainly a great deal less complex and cumbersome compared with national central government apparatus, but this is by no means a valid reason to increase its expenditure, something which has happened today for some of Parliament’s lines. I am, however, pleased that adequate funds have been reintroduced for SMEs and for Frontex, and, moreover, a substantial appropriation has rightly been approved for farmers who were seriously affected by the summer crisis caused by the proliferation of the lethal E. coli bacterium.</p>

      <p sl="el">The budget we are voting on today and which is expected to be adopted in December, if agreed with the Council, is designed to boost growth, employment and innovation in the EU. It invests in research and increases appropriations to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and to programmes in connection with the EU 2020 growth strategy. At the same time, it increases spending to manage influxes of refugees and immigrants and to strengthen maritime border controls in the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, spending on the EU external borders agency, Frontex, is inadequate, especially as this agency is currently performing a very important role in protecting the external and maritime borders in the Mediterranean and in patrolling the Greek-Turkish border, given the increase in the number of immigrants arriving via Turkey from North Africa and other third countries. In addition, greater priority and more money should, in my opinion, be given to the new European financial supervisory authorities in times of financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="es">I voted in favour because of the commitment that Parliament continues to show to an ambitious budget that will enable the targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy to be reached. The result of today’s vote lays down the blueprint for negotiations with the Council. Once again, we have shown our belief that it is crucial to increase investments in strategic sectors for Europe to emerge stronger from the crisis. Key investments in fields such as innovation or research, which can provide high added value to the European economy, are needed to successfully reach the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. Where the climate of austerity affects these fields, the way out of the crisis will be slow and counterproductive.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must fund the Europe 2020 strategy to promote growth and employment in Europe. We Socialists are therefore asking Member States to push for an ambitious agreement. The European budget is a means of supporting all countries and should increase investment in public policies that guarantee growth and social cohesion. Without an ambitious budget, Europe will fail to meet its responsibilities and it will continue to lose all credibility with its citizens.</p>

At a time of unprecedented crisis for the European Union and its Member States, I cannot accept the ‘lax’ signal sent by the two main political groups, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, who backed by 431 votes the Commission’s proposal to increase the European budget by 4% compared with 2011, that is to say by EUR 147.8 billion.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Adoption of the annual EU budget is always a moment of great importance, since this document confirms the institutions’ priorities and determines their activities. The draft 2012 budget concerns, not just the European Parliament, but also the other European institutions and the objectives written into the budget headings. As regards Parliament, I support the rapporteur’s proposals of an increase of around 0.8%, if we exclude spending on the 18 new Members resulting from the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon and expenditure relating to the EU’s expansion to include Croatia. We can only talk about an increase of around 1.44% compared to 2011 if everything is added together, which, even so, represents the lowest figure since 1999. As regards the various headings for different areas, the major problem results from Heading 1a, on competitiveness for growth and employment, owing to its low margins and because it funds important priorities. However, a compromise has successfully been reached on increasing its ceiling and ensuring that priorities such as the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises, entrepreneurship and innovation, lifelong learning and Erasmus Mundus had an allocation higher than that proposed by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The GALILEO navigation system is a satellite system which should become an alternative to the GPS system of the US or Russia’s GLONASS system. In contrast to GALILEO, both of the competing systems are funded by the military of these countries. GALILEO should be operational from 2014. It has many advantages, including full civilian funding, for example, and full compatibility with the US and Russian systems. The first two satellites were launched last week, and we were able to follow this opening event live at an exhibition in the European Parliament building in Brussels. Unfortunately, this event was not free of complications either, and had to be postponed. The EU first began talks on the introduction of this system in 1999. There are now voices doubting that we will be able to make the planned date in 2014 for having the system operational (though only in trial operation).</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europe’s GALILEO project has a 100% European base, so it is viewed by many as another benchmark for a European identity. The launch of the first two satellites on 21 October is only the start of a constellation of 30 satellites. This intelligent satellite navigation system will develop and improve countless applications and services, not least for a smart transport system, for search and rescue services, for secure financial transactions and for the supply of electricity. European independence from the US’s Global Positioning System (GPS) was one of the GALILEO project’s initial objectives. However, interoperability and compatibility work between the two has enabled the signing of this cooperation agreement. Following four years of negotiations, users of both navigation systems – GALILEO and GPS – will be able to make use of both with the same equipment. Even in its embryonic stage, the scale of this project demonstrates that GALILEO has a potential market of 3 billion users, and that its success will benefit the European market, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. It is estimated that it will generate EUR 90 billion over 20 years, and bring countless benefits to the public and society.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the conclusion of the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of GALILEO and GPS satellite-based navigation systems and related applications between the EU and US.

      <p sl="ro">The US manages the Global Positioning System (GPS), a dual use system that provides precision timing, navigation services and position location signals for civil and military purposes.

      <p sl="pl">An agreement on the reciprocal use of GPS and GALILEO systems will clearly be beneficial to millions of users of these navigation systems.

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report, since it was the subject of proposals submitted by the Committee on Regional Development to the Committee on Budgets. Given the great pressure on public budgets, parliaments need to be creative when attempting to rebalance their budgets. In addition to the unsustainably high level of sovereign debt and budget deficits, growing social inequalities in all European societies call for far-reaching initiatives. The establishment of the common internal market for the benefit of business and consumers was the core argument in favour of almost all European directives in the area of corporate taxation. Unfortunately, in combination with the persisting ideology of absolute independence for national legislators in the area of taxation, very detrimental effects became more and more significant. As such, a thorough revision of the Council directive on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States is indispensable at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because social inequality is increasing ever more in Europe and it is necessary to take specific initiatives to contain this phenomenon. In each European Union Member State, individuals and undertakings are subject to different systems of taxation. National tax bases are almost always illegal. In order to stop this we should supplement the existing directive as a matter of urgency and integrate more stringent anti-abuse provisions. One of the main objectives of the amendment of this directive is thus to facilitate multinational mergers and also to limit tax base erosion by European Union corporations, making the inflow of dividends from third country subsidiaries subject to minimum requirements. Another issue that will have to be addressed in the future is that of double-non-taxation. The Commission has already presented a proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, and this addresses part of the problem. However, this measure can only be effective if the possibilities for corporate tax evasion in the EU are limited in future.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The case of Switzerland, which is covered by the European directive under a bilateral agreement between Switzerland and the EU, shows how many holes there are in the EU’s current tax system. The dividends received from Swiss subsidiaries by EU parent companies are not subject to taxation or can be deducted anywhere within the EU. The state thus loses out to the multinational companies that avoid their tax responsibilities and contributions to public coffers in this way. I therefore agree with the implementation of a requirement that when no taxation to outbound flows is allowed, a 25% minimum tax rate has to be applicable in the inbound state. I therefore support the integration of stronger anti abuse provisions into the directive. The inflow of dividends from third country subsidiaries must, within the scope of the directive, be subject to minimum requirements, in order to limit tax base erosion by EU corporations. In contrast to this, I do not agree with the implementation of a common consolidated corporate tax base as a measure to tackle double-non-taxation. This measure will not help to limit the possibilities for corporate tax evasion in the EU, or to ease the compliance burden of businesses, but it will limit tax competition on the single market, undermining its competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="el">The European Parliament report on a common system of taxation in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States is based on a previous Council directive and basically recasts and simply codifies it. I abstained, because the report in question rightly notes that there is a race to the bottom of corporation rates in the EU and non-taxation or double non-taxation. Also, the report itself recognises that simple codification is not a solution to all these problems. However, within the framework being laid down and its intentions perhaps notwithstanding, it is unable to provide a convincing response and to distinguish itself from EU policies applied to date. As a result, in essence it simply codifies – and hence maintains – the prevailing EU tax policy, which is a far cry from a socially fair, acceptable and common European tax policy, a growth-oriented and distributive tax policy which is able to address the serious problem of tax shopping, of effective control and taxation of offshore companies and of the notorious tax havens springing up in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of the revision of the Council directive on the common system of taxation. The unsustainably high level of sovereign debt in the EU calls for a common European approach in order to alleviate the effects of the current financial crisis. In recent years, we have seen a fall in the average EU corporate tax rate (from 44% to 23.2%), together with the introduction of EU legislation which tackles double taxation for European corporations.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is resulting in an inevitable ‘race to the bottom’ of tax rates, in long-term non-taxation, and even in double non-taxation. I would also emphasise the problems that arise when multinational companies make profit in subsidiaries in tax havens outside the EU which attract capital flows by applying zero or limited taxation. The state loses out against multinational corporations which no longer pay their fair share towards financing public needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore endorse the imposition of a 25% minimum tax rate applicable in the inbound State and the introduction of measures to tackle double non-taxation. This directive will undoubtedly manage to reduce Member States’ sovereign debt and mitigate the economic differences caused by the different tax systems of countries inside and outside the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Mr Giegold, analyses a proposal for a Council directive on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States. The current financial and economic crisis has been making it difficult to draft the budgets for 2012. The Member States will have to make an additional effort in order to reduce expenditure and rebalance their budgets. This makes it essential to review the current tax system. The single market, as an integral part of the European project, still demonstrates many discrepancies between the Member States, which have been corrected using directives. One of the sources of many injustices within the EU is the tax system, which is to the detriment of businesses and consumers. There is, therefore, an urgent need for fiscal harmonisation that brings an end to tax havens, to double taxation and to capital flight from one Member State to another. I welcome the adoption of this report, which recommends a thorough review of the Council directive, so as to put a stop to existing shortcomings, not least double non-taxation, tax evasion and non-payment towards financing social needs. Finally, I hope this will contribute to strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Parliaments must be creative when it comes to restoring equilibrium, and not only in relation to the financial crisis. In addition to unsustainably high levels of government debt and budget deficits, social inequalities are also on the increase in all European countries. The single market is an integral part of the European project, but it also limits Member State sovereignty, particularly in the area of taxation. The creation of a common internal market to the benefit of businesses and consumers was the main reason behind the adoption of almost all of the European directives in the area of income tax on private individuals. The idea of absolute independence for national lawmakers in the area of taxation, however, does not look favourable. Competition in the area of taxation is stagnating in the EU, policy-making in the public sector is delayed, and it is also more difficult to ensure a more sustainable and socially integrated society, since movement of capital and profits is very easy and lucrative for some people, and at the same time unavailable to others.</p>
      <p sl="en">A thorough revision of the Council directive on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States, and aimed at facilitating multinational mergers, is therefore necessary now. Various individual Member State tax systems apply to people and businesses in the EU, and state protection of the tax base is almost always unlawful. I therefore believe that a common European approach is needed in order to correct this situation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This is the very first time that I have abstained on a report on tax. The explanatory statement is the main reason for my decision. In it, the rapporteur specifically states that the legislation currently in force, combined with the freedom of movement of capital, allows large multinational groups to fiddle around with the location of different subsidiaries in order to avoid paying corporation tax in full. Some call that tax optimisation. I call it fraud. In France, the average tax paid by the large companies in the CAC 40 is 10%, while SMEs are taxed at the full rate. Both the practice of locating subsidiaries in tax havens for the sole purpose of harbouring part of the profits generated elsewhere and the use of transfer prices are scandalous and must be halted. In legitimately seeking to minimise dual taxation, the legislation has actually created myriad opportunities for non-taxation, under-taxation, tax avoidance and even fraud. In fact, I now have a very different take on the common consolidated corporate tax base championed by Parliament, which would prevent multinationals from engaging in this unhealthy and loathsome charade within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">The unsustainably high level of sovereign debt and budget deficits requires the nations to rebalance their budgets. The persisting ideology of absolute independence for national legislators in the area of taxation is reducing the room for manoeuvre available to alleviate the problem. Against this general background, the existence of tax advantages for some businesses at European level, reflecting the growing social inequalities in all European societies, is enabling easy and lucrative capital and profit shifting. Therefore, a thorough revision of the Council directive on the system of taxation is necessary in order to reduce the differences in national tax systems and to resolve the double taxation and double non-taxation issues, by means of stronger anti-abuse provisions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Tax competition between the countries of the European Union has been restricting public policy’s room for manoeuvre. This competition has meant that average rates of corporate tax have decreased from 44% in 1980, to 35% in 1995 and, finally, to 23.2% in 2010. The need to reverse this downward spiral in corporate tax rates, to prevent tax evasion when transferring dividends, to prevent tax evasion, and to solve the double taxation problem constitute the objectives of the directive that is the subject of this report. I voted for this report because it proposes combating tax evasion and putting a stop to the double taxation of companies that meet their obligations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europe’s integration process has almost entirely passed by the taxation systems of the Member States, where a strict notion of sovereignty still predominates; fiscal sovereignty, in this case. However, this posture of inertia has led to veritable ‘lex shopping’ – since the Court of Justice clearly considers this acceptable when companies are being set up – which creates additional problems for the Member States. As regards the tax system to apply to parent companies and subsidiaries, for example, in a small number of cases, the double taxation principle means that value added is not taxed where the subsidiary is located but left to the country housing the parent company. This ends up being problematic, in that the location for the head office is chosen for reasons of ‘tax competition’. The figures are problematic: corporation tax in the EU decreased from 44% in 1980 to 35% in 1995. The current figure is 23.2%. There is therefore a need to adopt a common policy enabling this specific problem to be tackled, as the intervention of any Member State in isolation would be condemned to have little practical effect. I voted in favour for these reasons.</p>

Double non-taxation is one of the various loopholes which deprive national exchequers of legitimate revenue and urgently need toughening up. Today’s vote to strengthen the parent-subsidiary directive would be an important step forward in tackling this problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Crucially, MEPs have called for the introduction of a minimum effective tax rate on profits under the parent-subsidiary directive. EU member states and EU Taxation Commissioner Šemeta must now take this seriously. This means coming up with a revised legislative proposal that will properly prevent the shunting of profits around Europe by parent companies to avoid being corporate tax at the legitimate level. The Council should abstain from adopting the recasted directive, which serves as the legal basis for large scale tax avoidance schemes in the EU. In times of public austerity, the EU cannot afford to be soft on tax avoidance.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I welcome the attempt to simplify the budget policy rules from an administrative and financing perspective during the individual programme and project phases (submission of applications, evaluation and management), which the participants should benefit from as a matter of priority. Science and research are uncertain processes incorporating a specific risk, and funding based on results can restrict the aims of research projects to less risky projects and market-oriented research, which would frustrate top-level, cutting-edge research in the EU. Excessively strict interpretation of the financial regulation in recent years has unfortunately led to a general attempt to avoid risks and to a complete absence of trust in the participants in research programmes, reducing the effectiveness of implementation. The funding of European research should be based more on mutual trust and responsible partnership, tolerating risk in relation to participants in all phases, and with flexible EU rules applied in accordance with national rules and procedures. The evaluation of funding in the field of research should be based on the nature of the research and focused on top quality, importance and impact. Simplification is not a separate aim, but a means to ensuring the attractiveness and availability of EU funding intended for research. The simplification measures should also make it easier to limit errors.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The general objectives of the new regulation on budgetary rules are essentially in accordance with overall objectives relating to the implementation of EU policies, while at the same guaranteeing compliance with the principle of sound financial management. The regulation on budgetary rules and its implementing regulation, as well as the Multiannual Financial Framework and its annual budgets have a direct impact on European policy in the area of research, development and innovation. One of the main objectives of the regulation on budgetary rules should be to achieve a proper balance between the principle of financial responsibility and the principle of flexibility for beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is pleasing to see greater efforts being made towards simplifying the administrative and financial rules for framework programmes over the entire lifecycle of programmes and projects (submission of application, assessment and management), which should particularly benefit the participants. Funding must be changed in Europe in such a way as to ensure mutual trust and partnership based on responsibility. In my opinion, it is also right to tolerate a certain level of risk in relation to the participants in all stages, and last but not least, it is important to apply flexible EU rules in accordance with national rules and procedures.</p>

      <p sl="it">We need to promote market flexibility and security, as well as invest in closer integration between education, training and work, by, on the one hand, preventing early school leaving and encouraging vocational training, and, on the other, creating measures targeted at young people with a view to their integration on the labour market even before they have finished formal education.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Recent economic and labour market trends combined with future challenges, such as demographic change and the transition to a sustainable economy, require improvements in terms of employment, education and work organisation strategies in order to make the European Union more competitive, provide better working and living conditions and create new jobs, thereby promoting smart growth combining employment, social protection, as well as sustainable production and lifestyles. The challenges to be tackled as a matter of priority also include the insufficient skill levels that many workers currently have, as well as the low rankings some European countries have in terms of education levels, compared with the international situation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The EU must grant itself the resources needed to overcome the current economic and financial crisis. As I am convinced that the EU needs to redouble its efforts to stimulate growth and promote job creation, I voted in favour of the report by Ms Bastos. The ‘Agenda for New Skills and Jobs’ ties in with the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to achieve 75% employment among European citizens aged 20 to 64 by 2020. Other aims include increasing workers’ qualifications, new training options and improving the way that the labour market operates – by reducing red tape for SMEs, for example – all of which will make the EU more competitive.</p>

      <p sl="ga">I voted in favour of this important report and in favour of the rapporteur’s recommendations in relation to the mutual recognition of qualifications between the Member States of the EU, and especially between Member States and third countries.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The biggest difficulty faced by the youth of the EU is gaining recognition for qualifications conferred on them in other Member States, this happening despite the European Qualifications Framework. It is the uncertainty that exists in relation to questions such as probationary periods for teachers that is mostly a cause for those difficulties. It should be easier for graduates to move from one Member State to another for the purposes of employment and training and there should be mutual recognition of graduates’ qualifications and probationary periods between Member States, and it is up to the EU to ensure this.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Beyond that, I support the emphasis of the rapporteur on the importance of developing the relationship between the business sector and the universities and to strengthening the ‘Business-University’ relationship so that European graduates have the relevant skills and training to achieve the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Part of the structural unemployment that our societies are experiencing at present is the result of the gap between qualifications, training and recruitment needs. Ms Bastos’s report stresses the importance of anticipating future skills needs so as to ensure that training and education opportunities reflect the realities of the labour market. It seems to me that a better balance between supply and demand is a key factor in employment policy, particularly when it comes to young people. We need to link this strategy on new skills and jobs to the initiative being developed for young people (Youth on the Move). Lastly, I am sad to see that the amendment rejecting the European Commission’s proposal for considering the creation of a single permanent employment contract in the EU with progressive social entitlements has been rejected. This type of contract would only introduce further discrimination and create a new group of workers who would also be more vulnerable because of the absence of full social protection.</p>

      <p sl="it">The recent economic and financial crisis has highlighted the weak spots of the European economic and social model: since the first effects of the crisis made themselves felt on the labour markets in 2008, Europe has lost 5.6 million jobs. There are currently around 23 million unemployed in the EU, accounting for 9.5% of the active population, with grave implications for both growth and welfare in Europe. Equally disturbing are the difficulties encountered by some employers in recruiting staff, especially for highly skilled posts. Therefore, in view of the continuing negative effects of the crisis in Europe, it is now a priority to reinforce human capital by updating skills. The Member States have set the ambitious objective of a 75% employment rate by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to achieve this ambitious objective, I believe that the following are essential: the reduction of administrative burdens and red tape for SMEs in order to create jobs; further progress on the mutual recognition of qualifications as between the EU and third countries; closer cooperation between educational institutions and the world of business.</p>

I am especially pleased that the document devotes equal attention to employment issues affecting all age groups, in other words, that we are finally discussing not only the issue of youth unemployment, but also paying attention to unemployment among older people. We really cannot ignore issues faced by any group of people of working age, particularly when many Member States are raising the retirement age of their workers. As far as unemployment among young and older people is concerned, we must find means of promoting solidarity between these generations, rather than confrontation. I am also pleased that in many places the report stresses that employers must cooperate more closely with educational and professional training establishments so that in future we prepare precisely those specialists that the labour market needs most, and to that end also carry out more detailed research of the labour market. The measures proposed by the report to help workers balance work and personal life are equally important.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The economic, financial and social crisis has led to more than 5 million jobs being lost in the three years since it started. Europe sees itself faced with a reality which highlights the weaknesses in its social model. There are more than 23 million unemployed across the EU, accounting for 10% of the working population. This is an alarming figure which puts an immense strain on social protection systems in Europe. At the same time, we have the irony of a labour shortage for posts requiring high qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Europe is at a crossroads. It is imperative that we move into the black economically and in terms of growth. We must find the path to normality again. Europe must reach a situation where it can help its citizens to update their skills, establish a clearer relationship between education, vocational training and work, develop a suitable skill mix and anticipate better which skills will be sought after in the future so that a balance can be ensured between supply and demand on the labour market. Work must be encouraged and not social assistance.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the aforementioned report because I think that bolstering professional skills and participation in the labour market is an essential tool for a Europe intending to continue its journey to economic, financial and social recovery. Under the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Commission has set an EU-wide goal of achieving 75% employment in the 20-64 age group, thereby guaranteeing the sustainability of welfare systems and not insignificant improvement in the public finances of the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore think that, in tandem with the approach set out by the Commission and very much in support of Ms Bastos’s position, there are further margins for improvement.

I support the promotion of integrated approaches bringing together the main players at national, regional and local levels, and I would like to draw attention to the importance of the regional dimension in implementing the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs. It is also necessary to improve the standard and expand the range of employment services provided both to jobseekers and employers, and to make a particular effort in this area to develop individualised public services for the unemployed, young people and vulnerable groups. I consider it essential to ensure the more effective use of funding for the development of new skills, and for Member State governments to participate more in supporting job creation. It is also possible to use the social economy as a means for job creation for less advantaged social groups, which mainly means using the relevant funds and programmes: the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Progress Programme and INTERREG. In this context, I would like to emphasise the importance of synergies between the different European funds and the importance of a decentralised approach in the current use of these funds, in order to respond to the requirements of the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report by Ms Bastos as it deals pragmatically and proactively with the issue of unemployment, a problem that we cannot allow ourselves to neglect. Indeed, the economic crisis has had a significant effect on the labour market, reducing the employment rate in the 20-64 age group to 69% and increasing the rate of unemployment to 10%. In the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Union set itself a target of achieving 75% employment in the 20-64 age group within the next eight years, which translates to an employment growth rate of slightly higher than 1%.</p>
      <p sl="it">To reach this objective, the report that we have just voted on emphasises four points that I too acknowledge as essential for employment growth and growth of the whole economy: a better functioning labour market; a highly qualified workforce; better working conditions; and muscular policies designed to promote job creation. The proposed agenda is ambitious and that is precisely why we must strive, both in Europe and at the national level, for its implementation.</p>

However, the report’s overall approach is governed by the philosophy of asking the Member States to adapt their policies to market requirements and, leaving the pretexts aside, basically shifts responsibility for lifelong learning on to the workers. Furthermore, remaining within the framework of the EU 2020 strategy, it sees competitiveness and the promotion of ‘employability’ as the basic priority and objective and maintains, inter alia , a flexicurity-type approach. Finally, putting the market and its needs first for the purpose of developing skills and defining new types of jobs, it supports links between undertakings and education establishments and ‘stresses the need to involve employers in the management of education institutions and in the development of courses, teaching methods, apprenticeships and qualification’. As such, although there are a number of positive individual points in it, I voted against the report.</p>

Of the actions proposed by the Commission, I should like to lay particular emphasis on the issue of ‘flexicurity’; in other words, a more flexible labour market, linked to the guarantee of a level of job security. Furthermore, the Commission is attempting to make a significant effort to award people and businesses the necessary and appropriate incentives. This is important if there is to be investment in training and continuous updating of skills in response to changes in labour markets. As Ms Bastos says, there is room for improvement. Of the many suggestions she proposes, I should like to stress the need to ensure a high level of quality in the monitoring and anticipation of what will be the most sought-after and necessary skills for the future of students, as well as to reduce the bureaucratic and administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to stimulate job creation.</p>

According to estimates, in three years’ time there will be a shortfall of half a million posts in the IT sector and of a million health-care specialists. The causes of this are as follows: failure to identify promptly the requirements of the labour market, failure to adapt the education system, the school dropout rate and the gender imbalance in science and information technology at a time when women make up 60% of university graduates.</p>

The difficult world situation, and the constant and unpredictable economic, financial, budgetary, political and social crises pose us new questions and oblige us to think of new legislative solutions for the future educational and training development of our society, focused, obviously, on sustained increases in employability indices, so as to optimise the future benefits for our citizens. As such, I would stress the measures provided for in this own-initiative report as a whole. I would also stress the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy and, in particular, the Commission communication entitled ‘Agenda for new skills and jobs: a European contribution towards full employment’.

      <p sl="pt">Europe’s ambition of becoming a leading region in terms of employment and innovation is already a thing of the past, and has, unfortunately, been shown to be unrealistic. The recent strength shown by other parts of the world has made Europe’s limitations clear and shown how the EU and its Member States have not been able to find solutions that come close to the periodically issued statements of intent. The current situation is serious, and demands courage and creativity on the part of our leaders, as well as of our societies, which have long been used to a social model that has increasingly been showing itself to be unsustainable. Future generations will not forgive us if we do nothing about this and if we persist in refusing to acknowledge the radical changes that have been taking place in the markets. This compels us to discuss the model of the state, the sustainability of social security, demographics, labour relations, and education and research policy, along with many other issues. The Commission’s proposal to create an Agenda for New Skills and Jobs, which I welcome, may be a useful step in the right direction, but in and of itself will not be enough to reverse the depressive cycle in which we find ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">The economic, financial and social crisis afflicting Europe has brought out the weak points of the European economic and social model, and wiped out some aspects of the progress achieved in the past. According to the available data, there are currently 23.051 million people unemployed in the EU, which is 9.5% of the active population, and this has serious consequences for growth and prosperity in Europe. Equally alarming are the difficulties that some employers face over the recruitment of employees, particularly for highly-qualified positions. Even during the crisis it was difficult for some of them to fill posts with properly qualified people. I firmly believe that boosting human capital and employability through modernising skills would be a step in the right direction for European recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential to give people the right incentives that will assist them in the effort to modernise their skills, help them to make a closer link between education and vocational training and work, and predict more effectively what skills will be needed in the future, in order to ensure a better balance between supply and demand on the labour market. In order to create effective policies on employment, education and vocational training, it is essential to improve the ability of Member States and the Union to make forecasts, predict the nature of future qualifications and ensure that they meet the needs of the labour market.</p>

I also believe that there is room for improvement, especially as regards the following: the reduction of administrative burdens and red tape for SMEs in order to create jobs; improved monitoring and anticipation of necessary skills for the future, thus permitting a closer match with supply and orienting the development of skills in terms of enhanced prospects of employment over a lifetime; the need to strengthen the rules on flexicurity and adapt them to the socio-economic context of each Member State, in order to ensure a flexible labour market, proactive policies in relation to that market, lifelong learning and modern welfare systems; closer cooperation between educational institutions and the world of business and similar measures.</p>

      <p sl="it">The goal set by the Europe 2020 strategy of achieving a 75% employment rate for the 20-64 age group can only be attained by reformulating vocational skills, which inevitably entails a thorough adaptation of the education and training systems. Ms Bastos’s report, for which I voted in favour, highlights these aspects and, above all, it attempts to focus on the issue of job candidates often lacking specific vocational skills, even at a time of crisis such as the one we are experiencing. Moreover, we need to invest comprehensively in the labour market, by increasing the number of women in the field of information technology and better preparing students about to face the new employment challenges.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can therefore meet the objective set by the Europe 2020 strategy by carrying out reforms and implementing an education and training system which is of a higher quality and which integrates workers into a global and specialised market. Therefore, a reduction in the unemployment rate also depends on closer coordination between the education, training and employment systems.</p>

      <p sl="ro">There is one aspect that I would like to dwell on: SMEs and their importance to this subject. SMEs provide 85% of jobs in the EU. SMEs generate 58% of the added value created in the EU. We must therefore promote schemes for encouraging SMEs which are going to generate new jobs, whether they are in areas such as new technologies, research or innovation, or in the creative industries. Reducing the level of red tape to a minimum and improving their access to funding are matters which the Commission must deal with and ensure that they are also achieved at Member State level.

      <p sl="it">The current economic and financial crisis has shown up the weaknesses of the European economic and social model. Currently, almost 9.5% of the active population of the European Union are unemployed, with grave implications for growth and welfare in Europe. We therefore need to reinforce human capital and employability by updating skills. That is the only way to enter a period of genuine recovery.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, the Member States have set the ambitious target of a 75% employment rate for the 20-64 age group by 2020. In order to reach these objectives, labour market reforms must be stepped up and suitable incentives must be provided for individuals and companies to help them invest in training. We must help create favourable conditions for job creation, inter alia by cutting administrative burdens and taxes related to labour and mobility.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we are to devise effective policies for employment, education and training, we will need to improve the capacity of the Member States and the Union to forecast and anticipate the nature of future skills and ensure that they are in line with labour market needs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Although it tackles some positive points such as universal access to lifelong learning, social inclusion and the combating of discrimination, this report on the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs includes issues with which we cannot agree. We believe investment in promoting entrepreneurship and freelance work are measures aimed at absolving the Member States of responsibility for creating jobs, so placing all the responsibility on the public. Neither do we agree with the strengthening of rules on flexicurity, as this means greater precariousness, less security and more flexibility.

      <p sl="ro">Increasing the European Union’s global competitiveness requires major changes to be made to the labour market, especially as demographic changes are affecting the availability of labour resources. I find it worrying that, at a time of economic crisis, employers are finding it difficult to find a highly skilled workforce. After all, it is precisely these skills which can add value to the European economy. There are numerous solutions available for us to achieve our labour market objectives: from anticipating skill requirements better to establishing closer ties between universities and the business sector; from raising the profile of non-formal education to encouraging cross-border mobility among as many citizens as possible and mutual recognition of qualifications; from creating more green jobs to making vocational training more attractive and also instilling a culture of lifelong learning. Unfortunately, education and training are the very areas which have suffered huge cuts in expenditure in a number of EU countries due to the economic and financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="fr">According to forecasts from the International Labour Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, no fewer than 110 million jobs need to be created by 2015 in order for the G20 countries to return to pre-crisis levels.

This is one of the levers that Europe needs to use to avoid economic decline. Recovery is dependent on job creation and solidarity. In this context, in order to promote sustainable, green growth, the EU needs to focus particularly on SMEs, which are real growth drivers and generate 58% of added-value in the EU; on bringing more women into the labour market (only 30% of business owners are women); on integrating people with disabilities; on guaranteeing a flexible, inclusive and active labour market, and on improving research and innovation.

      <p sl="de">When this report states that the current economic, financial and social crisis has invalidated some of the progress made in the past, then it needs to be made clear that the crisis has merely further intensified a trend that has been developing for a long time. In the past, there was constant praise for the fact that more jobs were continually being created. However, the fact that most of the new jobs were part-time posts, filled by workers in limited part-time employment, and many people were forced into poverty as a result of ‘mac-jobs’ was quietly ignored.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the EU constantly preaches that a good education is the guarantee of a job and believes that lifelong learning can put a stop to this trend, then it is taking action that is completely divorced from reality. One indication of this is the number of unemployed academics, who have been displaced by the cheap competition pushing its way in from abroad. To now impose even more flexibility on workers and increase the precarious situation is the wrong way to go and something that I reject in the strongest possible terms.</p>

      <p sl="it">In recent years, various economic, social and cultural factors have led to a radical change in the labour markets; this report clearly identifies certain key points and challenges for the future. Firstly, we need to close the current gap, which is too large, between the world of education and training and the world of work. This is why we should welcome continuous exchanges between the two worlds, with greater involvement of employers and production facilities in the training of young people. Once they have received suitable training, these young people must have full access to employment with appropriate recognition.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, the report places the right emphasis on the need to safeguard the manufacturing and handicraft sector, since it is in danger of meeting a slow, painful demise. Apart from frequently representing a region’s excellence and traditions, it can be a genuine, powerful driver for development. Lastly, I would like to stress an important aspect regarding senior citizens: I think that it makes a great deal of sense to establish serious, coordinated volunteer programmes to make the most of a wealth of experience and knowledge which otherwise would inevitably be lost.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I am delighted that the European Parliament today approved its position on one of the seven flagship strategies of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs. Today, as the EU grapples with the problem of very high unemployment, particularly among young people, I believe that the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs can provide some solutions. We must above all focus on much higher quality and more inclusive education, not only education in primary and secondary schools and universities, but also lifelong learning. We must define the profile of graduates, so that we do not needlessly produce and educate graduates who have no chance of applying their skills. We now know very well that some fields of study are completely worthless. I am, of course, in favour of retaining programmes for the training of traditional skills, as this is part of the EU’s cultural heritage which we must preserve for future generations. I do not agree, however, with the constant rise in numbers of politics graduates, for example, as it is clear we will not need so many of them. We should focus more on training in practical skills, such as languages and IT, and particularly on teaching our students how to learn.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this report because it calls on EU Member States to better coordinate their economic policies in order to create jobs and facilitate effective competition. Throughout Europe, there are various inequalities within employment policies. While maintaining budgetary discipline is crucial to avoid debt, spending cuts in areas such as education and the labour market would increase the shortage of skilled workers in Europe. Competitiveness and employment must be promoted to move towards a sustainable, stronger and greener economy. To improve competitiveness in the EU, as well as create new jobs, there must be better education and employment strategies. I support the rapporteur, who urges the EU to combat discrimination of any kind, whether based on gender, age or nationality, more effectively. The flexicurity arrangements that exist must be strengthened and adapted to each Member State. Member States must improve workers' rights. Even at a time of economic problems, social and unemployment protection can not be sacrificed. Additionally, Member States should help workers integrate their jobs and their family life. Innovation is necessary to further boost employment. Pursuing full employment must go hand-in-hand with improving working conditions.</p>

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the report in its entirety. There are currently 21 million people out of work in the EU, approximately 10% of its active population. If you look at unemployment among young people, especially in countries that have been hit by the crisis, the figures are terrifying: 42.9% of people aged 25 or under in Greece and 46.2% in Spain. One in two young people are unemployed. These figures certainly do not reflect the dreams and visions of united Europe, let alone the dreams, visions and ambitions of the young Europeans that are the future of this continent. We all understand that, in this sort of strategy, in this sort of agenda on new skills and jobs, quantified targets need to be set for 2020. However, it is contradictory to adopt this agenda and set ambitious targets for it, on the one hand, and for numerous Member States, of which there were five in 2011, to cut spending on education when growth rates in Europe are stagnant. There is no alternative. The Member States need to put money into research, education and innovation. We need to create the opportunities that the young generation deserves.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Agenda for New Skills and Jobs is one of the seven flagship initiatives to boost growth and jobs contained in the EU 2020 strategy. Achieving sustainable growth has to be based on an inclusive labour market to maximise the full potential of Europe’s labour force, to increase employment rates and to improve job quality, equal opportunities and labour and social protection. I strongly support the negotiated labour market reforms; negotiated flexicurity combined with strong social protection systems; strengthening pension systems; investments in public education systems; respect for labour and social rights in the European legislation; labour law to cover all types of workers and labour contracts with rights. We should do more to guarantee that mobile and migrant workers in Europe enjoy equal treatment with residents, in the workplace and beyond. The gender gaps are a major obstacle to the functioning of EU labour market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that more needs to be done to tackle discrimination against women, young people, elderly workers and people with disabilities, minorities, with regard to access to employment, pay gaps, career progression, training, or working conditions.

      <p sl="en">I welcome this report by Ms Bastos on the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs. We must not neglect investment in social, health, care and educational services and infrastructure. Such an investment would not only lead to an increase in the standard of care for service-users but, due to changes in the demographic structure of the European Union, it would also promote sustainable employment. Secondly, we need to enquire into the working conditions for carers and workers in the care sector. In Ireland, over 160 000 people identified themselves as carers at the last census. However, only 56% of these carers were in paid employment. This is despite their contributing an estimated EUR 2.5 billion to the economy. More needs to be done to ensure greater recognition and working conditions for carers. Thirdly, a more inclusive labour market is needed, particularly where young people are concerned. Across the 27 Member States, youth unemployment is at a record-high with 20.5% of European youth unemployed. There is undoubtedly a need to promote traineeships and apprenticeships for school-leavers, but also to ensure that these programmes are accessible and lead to sustainable jobs and long-term employment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Structurally, the employment problem is one of the key issues in macroeconomic analysis of the social reality. While from one point of view it is the principal factor of production, from another perspective it is a singular route to personal achievement and well-being. An agenda for jobs cannot fail to take both of these aspects into account: firstly, the very economic development of the EU involves making available resources fit for the job; secondly, and above all, this is probably the most delicate problem that the authorities have to face, because of its deep immersion in the social reality. An agenda for jobs, then, must be founded on high levels of professional training of workers, and on a regulatory framework that transforms innovation and business development into incentives for people. In turn, job security must, rather than appearing to be an end in itself in the labour relationship, be reduced to the condition of the worker’s guarantee against the profound asymmetry of labour ties. This is one of the great challenges for Europe’s future. I voted in favour because I can see this belief explained.</p>

Although the Europe 2020 strategy includes a target employment rate of 75% for the 20-64 age group by 2020, we must acknowledge that we are facing a growing number of challenges as we seek to maintain our social model. Training for workers and the labour market need to adapt to this tough new economic reality. I am pleased to see that is the thrust of the measures proposed in Ms Bastos’s report. We now need to make real headway with support for education and further training, on protecting workers’ social rights throughout their working life, investing massively in research and innovation in order to create jobs for the future, and on improving working conditions. Ambitious policies are needed to reconcile workers’ expectations and the needs of the labour market, not least through the creation of European Sector Councils on employment and skills, as proposed in this perceptive report.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The economic, financial and social crisis now affecting Europe has pointed up the weaknesses of the European economic and social model, and has invalidated certain aspects of the progress achieved earlier.

There are currently 23 051 million unemployed in the EU, accounting for 9.5% of the active population, with grave implications for growth and welfare in Europe. Equally disturbing are the difficulties encountered by some employers in recruiting staff, especially for highly skilled posts. Even during the crisis, certain employers were finding it hard to find people with suitable skills for the vacancies to be filled.

      <p sl="pl">One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to raise the level of employment of women and men in the EU to 75%. The current level of employment of women in the EU is 58.2%, and huge differences exist between the Member States in this regard. In my opinion on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy I pointed out that changing this situation requires urgent improvement of links between vocational training and labour market needs. To this end it is essential, among other things, to improve academic and careers guidance services and encourage traineeships and apprenticeships for women. It is also important to create new opportunities for training, including in scientific, mathematical and technological fields, in order to increase women’s employability in technical and scientific positions, non-traditional jobs and the low-carbon and high-tech sectors of the economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For the new programme to be a success, it is also crucial to take steps to eliminate gender-based wage differentials, to improve the mobility of employees in the EU and to include solidarity and cooperation between generations in the mainstream of employment policy.</p>

As I agree with the Commission, I am voting for Parliament’s document.

The EU’s new industrial policy needs to promote education in technical fields. Furthermore, in view of the estimated shortage of health-care and IT professionals, we call on the Commission and Member States to adopt measures aimed at providing well-qualified human resources and the skills required for these areas.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I voted for Amendment 1, which calls on the Commission to take into account that in labour markets with a high prevalence of SMEs and where workers very often lack proper representation at company level, decentralised collective bargaining might lead to a deterioration in working conditions.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The unemployment rate in Lithuania (34%) is one of the highest in the EU. The rate of unemployment is only higher in Greece and Spain. One of the reasons for such an unreasonably high rate is the incompatibility of young people’s qualifications with the requirements of the labour market. Last year, 52% of all young unemployed people registered with the Lithuanian Labour Exchange had not acquired any vocational training. Acquiring vocational qualifications and education remains the best means of combating unemployment. According to this report, the improvement of workers’ knowledge and skills, taking into account the requirements of the labour market, will increase employment opportunities and will help Europe to recover in the long term. It is also necessary to further reorganise the labour market so that it offers greater flexibility and security. EU governments, including my own, should offer companies more suitable incentives to invest in training. In my opinion, long-term unemployment is an area that requires greater attention. According to data from the second quarter of 2011, 52% of people registered as unemployed in Lithuania have been looking for work for one year or more. The objectives of the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs should be oriented towards this group of people.</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported this resolution, which calls for a focus on matching skills to labour market needs. This is a main objective of the EU2020 strategy and will help to bridge the gap between education and employment. I believe that the focus on increasing participation in lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important; ensuring that people of all ages and at all stages of their careers have the opportunity to develop their skills is essential to an inclusive working society. Encouragement should be given to promote workplace-based training to introduce young people to the labour market from an early stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">There should also be minimum standards in terms of pay and social rights to set decent working conditions and protect trainees in all Member States. With an ambitious goal of reaching a 75% employment rate for 20-64 year olds in the EU by 2020, this initiative places emphasis on human capital and employability through an updating of skills. In voting for the resolution, the European Parliament demonstrates its commitment to the important issue of tackling unemployment in today’s society.</p>

      <p sl="de">On account of the financial and economic crisis, EU-wide unemployment has risen to 9.5% In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Member States have undertaken to aim for and achieve an employment level of 75%. As a result of the changing requirement profiles of undertakings, we need to optimise capacity in the Union in order to adapt future skills and labour market requirements to the labour market. We need to reduce bureaucracy for SMEs in order to support the creation of jobs. Moreover, for early school-leavers and those who do not finish their traineeships, alternatives in the field of training and apprenticeship should be developed and offered.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as part of this codecision process on resettling refugees, which has already gone on a long time, we visited refugee camps in Syria as representatives of Parliament, and it was difficult to explain to the people in the refugee camps how the process could take so long owing to an obstacle that essentially has nothing to do with the content of the codecision itself, which was adopted by Parliament with a large majority a year and a half ago, and which has also received support in debates from the Commission and the Council on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It was difficult to explain that this process was blocked because of Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon, on delegated acts. This was something about which those refugees, some of the most vulnerable people in the world, clearly neither knew nor needed to know. However, there have been several attempts to resolve this issue. There was a proposal by the Hungarian Presidency in May, to which we responded with a counterproposal by Parliament itself in June, and we have been waiting until now for a response from the Council which at long last concludes the codecision that we initiated one and a half years ago, and which, among other things, enables an increase in the funding available to the Member States’ for making voluntary resettlements. It is important to add the word ‘voluntary’ here, as it is the Member States that decide to begin their processes of resettling refugees and decide on the numbers to be resettled by this process, so they do not have to fear any kind of imposition from the Commission or Parliament. All that is needed is for the Council to conclude the codecision on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the meantime, people have already died, which we would have been able to address when emergency situations broke out in the Mediterranean had the codecision been adopted, along with its emergency mechanism for resettling refugees. Today, the only good news is that we have saved that part of the codecision by adopting it through a pilot project of this very Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament, therefore, did its homework a year and a half ago, and continues to work ceaselessly on behalf of refugees, who are the most vulnerable people on the planet and whose numbers are relatively small.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to finish by asking the Council three very specific things: firstly, what does the Council think of the counterproposal made by Parliament in June? Secondly, how does the Council intend to go about concluding this codecision? Thirdly, I would like to ask whether the Council is willing to fast-track negotiations in conjunction with Parliament and the Commission in order to close this file by the end of the Polish Presidency. If not, we will lose not one or two months, but two whole years of resettling refugees, with all the suffering that this entails for the people waiting and despairing in the refugee camps, who may run the risk of fuelling human trafficking networks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually absurd. With regard to this important subject of a resettlement programme, we have achieved agreement across all of the groups. Many of the Member States are already implementing resettlement programmes. In other words, there is broad consensus that this is necessary and, above all, that it is not only an urgent, but also a highly volatile situation – as demonstrated in particular by the current situation in Africa. Thus, it is actually absurd that, even though there is agreement from almost all sides, this can founder simply as a result of the technical implementation. It is the duty of both the European Parliament – we are aware of this and that is why we have tabled a proposal – and the Council to assume responsibility here and to push this matter forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have experienced the Polish Presidency to be very creative, also in connection with the asylum package. It has tabled new proposals. For that reason, I am really placing my hope in the fact that you will now see the opportunity and present us with a proposal that is workable for the Council, the Commission and for us as Parliament, and that now, as we are in any case all in agreement, we can finally also tackle the implementation and – as Mr Tavares also said – can finally bridge that period that costs some people their lives. That is something that we need to be aware of in relation to this matter. I do not mean to be dramatic here, but each additional day that it takes us can cost someone’s life.</p>

      <p sl="es">Holding refugees in custody is both expensive and unjust. It prevents them from overcoming the traumatic experiences they have lived through, it criminalises people who have suffered crimes against humanity, and it is a waste of public money. Let us take a different course of action making use of alternatives to custody.</p>
      <p sl="es">In a world that is becoming increasingly bipolar and with an ailing economy, Europe is doomed to indifference and failure. Let us reinvigorate our values. I fully go along with the questions that my colleague and great friend Rui Tavares has raised here today.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, once again plenary is debating the creation of a joint EU resettlement programme. We debated it a few months ago, when we re-addressed this issue in debates on the asylum package, and we all agreed that the refugee resettlement programme links in directly with the overall asylum package that we need to complete by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, whereas we all have the same intention, we ultimately disagree on who will make the decision and how. Of course, this disagreement, while this debate continues and we make no progress, is being interpreted as political inadequacy.</p>
      <p sl="el">If you think that 84 000 of our fellow men have applied for resettlement and we have only managed to process 6 800 of those applications, then you will understand the magnitude of the problem. Resettlement – as we have to explain every time – is not simply a facility, as we have discussed in the past, that Europe must have in order to demonstrate its solidarity with third countries and in order for us to show respect for those of our fellow men in difficulty. Resettlement means rescuing a person when we cannot protect them in their present situation. That is what resettlement means, especially in these difficult times, with the massive upheavals in the Arab world. Of course, we understand that the Council too has its position, but the delay and constant procrastination are, unfortunately, not helping.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me to finish by saying that it should be self-evident to all of us – we too, here in Parliament, as we have stressed time and again, are willing to take our share of the responsibility – that we should use the EUR 628 million in the Refugee Fund. That the Treaty of Lisbon needs to be applied in connection with the interinstitutional modus operandi should also be self-evident. It should also be self-evident, from the point of view of perception and approach, that Europe has no more room for disagreement, be it on the economy today or on immigration tomorrow; we have resettlement, we have the asylum package. We must, without further delay, all join together and make the maximum possible use of every facility available to us at Union level.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I wish, on behalf of my political group, to voice our surprise at how the Council has handled the question of resettlement of refugees.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Council’s position has still not been made clear to us, because it has done nothing over the long period of time since the agreement was brokered at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="el">As we all know full well, the Member States can already benefit from the European Refugee Fund. In order to encourage the Member States to resettle refugees – because, generally speaking, there are very low resettlement rates at global level – the Member States of the European Union receive EUR 4 000 per refugee.</p>
      <p sl="el">The agreement we brokered together simply upgrades the current practice, by making provision for greater economic aid: EUR 6 000 instead of 4 000 for Member States which have never resettled refugees, so that they can develop suitable infrastructures.</p>
      <p sl="el">Given that this will create a win-win situation – in fact nearly everyone stands to gain something – I truly do not understand why the agreement has been blocked in the Council for so long and why the Member States have not done anything.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to ask the Council representative for an explanation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, the Polish Presidency understands the fears Members have expressed about the delay in establishing the joint EU resettlement programme which would be put in place by adopting a proposal amending the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013. We would like to remind everyone that the present European Refugee Fund for 2008-2013 does identify the question of resettlement as a desirable measure. Furthermore, since 2008 a significant amount has been allocated from the European Refugee Fund to this purpose. Under the present rules, Member States are entitled to apply for the sum of EUR 4 000 for each resettled person falling into one of the categories set out in the appropriate decision.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The main aim of the proposed amendments to the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for 2008-2013 is to create the possibility to establish common Union annual priorities for resettlement. This would mean that action taken on resettlement at Union level would be better coordinated and focussed. Also important is the fact that annual priorities would contain certain specified categories, some of which are mentioned in the current decision on the European Refugee Fund. For example, one of the categories qualifying for financial support from the European Refugee Fund is persons from a country or region designated for the implementation of a Regional Protection Programme.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Regional Protection Programme was established in April 2010. It includes persons resettled from North Africa who qualify for grants from the current Refugee Fund. The same applies to particularly vulnerable groups, such as children and women at risk, and also to persons with serious medical needs. Seven Member States: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden have offered the Bureau of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 408 places to resettle persons from North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="pl">While it is true that participation in resettlement work is voluntary, the European Parliament has suggested the adoption of further incentives to involve a greater number of Member States by increasing the levels of the grants available. The proposal being made is for the provision of EUR 6 000 for each resettled person for a Member State which uses the Fund for resettlement purposes for the first time, and EUR 5 000 for each resettled person for a Member State which has already used the Fund in the past. The Council would be able to support these plans. However, the Council cannot support the suggestion of the European Parliament on application of the procedure of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to adopt common Union annual priorities for resettlement. The Council’s position is based on explanations provided by the European Commission relating to the time frames imposed by the programming period in connection with operation of the General Programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’. The Council shares the view of the Commission that establishing annual priorities for resettlement is a purely executive function, because it concerns the application of detailed principles specified in a decision concerning a specific situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Council is trying to find a way to resolve this issue, and this includes consideration of the alternative approach put forward in May of this year, thanks to which it would be possible to avoid the necessity of using delegated acts. Nevertheless, the Polish Presidency does regret that it has so far not been possible to find a mutually acceptable solution to this particular question and that as a result of this situation it has not yet been possible to adopt the decision in question in full. Considering that measures related to resettlements can be financed from the current Refugee Fund and taking into account the fact that there is now only one annual period left in the present programme, the Polish Presidency thinks it would be better to continue the discussion on establishing a joint EU resettlement programme in the context of the next programming period.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">It was not a point of order but a clarification requested by Mr Tavares. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you may take note of this and answer in your speech at the end of the debate.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, as you know it is not common for the Commission to be present during Council Question Time, and it is even less common for it to participate – although I have often thought its participation would be of value. On this occasion, however, I am pleased to announce that our friend and former colleague Commissioner Malmström has expressed that she is willing to speak and voice her opinion on such a relevant matter as this.</p>

    <intervention id="3-272-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have debated this issue numerous times and I think you are aware of my commitment and my services’ commitment to finding a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very frustrating to be discussing formalities when the most vulnerable people in the world are waiting for us to make a decision. We need to find procedures to overcome this so that we can put the programme in place as soon as possible. I know that the Polish Presidency, like the Hungarian Presidency, tried to find a compromise, but it did not gather sufficient support.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware of the informal counter-proposal put by the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. The problem is that it raises some important legal and institutional concerns, most specifically regarding the establishment of a procedure outside the Treaty which would nonetheless legally bind the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Refugee Fund is a complex fund with well-defined rules; some would say too well-defined. Pledging of resettlement must take place every year in June. As the Resettlement Fund only runs until 2013, next year’s pledging exercise will be the last in his current fund. It will therefore be the last chance for us to establish annual EU resettlement priorities under the present rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any amendment to the fund decision must be finalised in the coming month to ensure that pledging by Member States could take place next spring under the new rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are committed to making every effort to work with the Council, the co-legislators, the rapporteur and Parliament to try to finalise a compromise that could establish an EU joint resettlement programme under the present financial perspective. But such a compromise must respect the rules and the procedures in the Treaty, must ensure the smooth functioning of the Fund and must be acceptable to all parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that we are working hard and we are willing to work even harder to find a flexible way to fund EU resettlement in the future. This is an increasingly important issue, and we hope that increased funding, combined with new more flexible rules in the future, will result in more resettlement in the EU Member States, which would express our solidarity with the most vulnerable people in the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commissioner said two things which I think are very important. One is that we should analyse properly the counter-proposal by the rapporteur, because I think what Mr Tavares is trying to do is get some movement here on something which is frustrating colleagues right across the political spectrum, as we heard in the speeches by the authors of the oral question. Secondly, you said that we need to have future financing and a stable position for future resettlement so that we do not keep coming back with oral questions in this frustrating way.</p>
      <p sl="en">For our group it is very simple: if we do not find a solution before the end of 2011, we jeopardise the planned use of the European Refugee Fund, which lapses in 2013. Secondly, Member States will not receive the extra funds allocated by the European Refugee Fund; and thirdly, of course, the emergency mechanism provided for in this codecision, which we could have used in the context of the Arab Spring, will continue to remain inoperative.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very clear that there is agreement that, while we spend many hours in this Parliament and in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs talking about common asylum policies, resettlement is a way of managing, in a very coordinated and sometimes symbolic way, the pressures that we now see in the Mediterranean. For this reason, we can contrast – as other speakers have said – the way that we operate our resettlement programme (with fairly small numbers and some inaction from the Council) with what has happened with the US and Canada, for example, where so many more thousands of refugees have been resettled in a coordinated way.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order for the EU better to respond to such situations, the European Parliament adopted this codecision report on the European Refugee Fund as far back as May 2010. As the Commissioner has just said, it is deeply frustrating that we are constantly coming back to this Parliament to find a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore wanted this debate today because we need answers. Parliament has put proposals on the table aimed at finding a solution to the delegated acts issue, but this has met with silence from the Council. This is obviously unacceptable, and we fully expect the Council to inform us of its position on delegated acts in a way that is credible, and on all the positive aspects of this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The pressure on the Council must be maintained. We are frustrated in Parliament across the parties, and I think we will continue to push this issue, because it is a managed and humane way of dealing with some of the consequences of the Arab Spring. In future we will have crises on which we want a stable policy, and that is what our group wants, in common with the other groups in this House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I firmly believe that resettlement is a good thing and it is also a positive sign from civilised society to take on those responsibilities. It is a sad reality that, because of conflict or repression and other factors, some people simply cannot go back to their countries of origin.</p>
      <p sl="en">My country, the UK, is one of the EU Member States that already engages in resettlement. It does this in cooperation with the UNHCR and with NGOs. We are very proud of the contribution that we can and do make. However, I question whether it is really necessary for the EU to produce these new plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Surely asylum and immigration issues should remain primarily Member States’ responsibility. Flows of immigrants and asylum seekers vary enormously from one Member State to the other, and this leads to different pressures on those states’ institutions that deal with these issues. Furthermore, it is as yet unclear to what extent these proposals will be based on political priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, historically, EU Member States have ties to different parts of the world. Participation in United Nations programmes, like that for Bosnia, should continue, and I would invite a continuing generosity in connection with these programmes on what is a very sensitive issue.</p>

The European Union must move up a gear by proposing concrete, long-term measures. This is the purpose of this resettlement programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The conclusion – at last – of the ordinary legislative procedure on this issue and, by extension, the application by all the Member States of the common European programme on the resettlement of refugees, at a historic moment in time, would bear witness to our will to react effectively by working together to propose suitable instruments.</p>

This support for the people of partner countries must result in Europe showing solidarity by accommodating refugees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European resettlement programme should be an additional tool for protecting refugees and asylum seekers. It should allow for the implementation of a European hospitality policy for resettled populations. It needs to be implemented urgently. We must break the deadlock before the end of 2011, and it is up to the Council to do this.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the resettlement of refugees is generally considered to be a non-violent and peaceful solution for the most vulnerable refugees, who often face long-term difficult circumstances and challenging conditions. The European Parliament recently adopted a report on the European Refugee Fund. In the interests of a faster solution to the situation, the Union should try to strengthen its European Refugee Fund and adopt a sustainable European programme for refugees.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Later, in June, the Council proposed the informal solution of applying a partial codecision procedure. Parliament immediately responded with a counter proposal based on the full codecision procedure, but the Council has yet to make any statement or response. We have lost a lot of time with such injudicious conduct, and unless an appropriate common solution can be found by the end of 2011, there will clearly be no proper exploitation of the options available to the European Refugee Fund. Member States will lose resources allocated by the Fund and refugees will languish in camps. It may also be the case, sadly, that some of them fall victim to human trafficking networks, or even lose their lives. In my opinion, Commissioner, that should be unacceptable to the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council. I would therefore like to appeal for us to find a common solution as quickly as possible, so that we can jointly resolve this situation.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, in recent months, we have seen more than a million people leave everything behind them and flee Arab and North African nations in the face of persecution, violence and war.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Although relatively few have come to Europe, we have all been moved by scenes of men, women and children risking their lives on unseaworthy boats, trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. Many drowned in the attempt and the exact number of lives lost in this way will remain unknown.</p>
      <p sl="sl">According to the figures, last year approximately 5 000 refugees resettled in EU territory, while around 75 000 resettled in the US in the same period. In fact, as a whole, EU Member States currently accept fewer refugees for resettlement than Canada, a statistic that clearly demonstrates that Europe must do much more with regard to immigration.</p>
      <p sl="sl">But how can we do this, when our failure to agree has already cost us two years and seriously jeopardised additional funding, which countries will be denied if we do not reach an agreement by the end of the year? It is imperative that a European Union joint resettlement programme be agreed as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sl">According to various figures, there should be approximately 6 000 places in Europe for people who can no longer return to their own home, whether they are unwilling to do so for fear of continued persecution or are living in dangerous conditions in their country of first asylum.</p>
      <p sl="sl">By accelerating this programme, which must become an integral part of EU asylum policy, Europeans would show greater commitment to international solidarity and shared responsibility, while receiving the financial investment needed.</p>
      <p sl="sl">If not, we will seriously endanger refugees’ new lives, worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in refugee camps and ensure refugees are even easier prey for people trafficking networks.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The European Refugee Fund and the European Resettlement Programme are both measures that save the lives of refugees. We all hold in our hands responsibility for those who risk their lives. It is therefore high time that we found a solution and that the Council began to inform us of procedures promptly and in an appropriate manner.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am disappointed that we are once again having to discuss the deadlock on the resettlement issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We voted on this over a year ago, but technical considerations continue to stand in the way of discussions. This is a far cry from the concerns of refugees who live in extremely precarious conditions, without any prospect of their situation improving.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now more than ever, we need to take urgent action to finally solve the institutional deadlock that we have been in for too long. Our objective must be to offer practical assistance to the growing number of people seeking resettlement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be honest, granting international protection to those who need it is not simply about granting them a status – even if this is already difficult. It is not just a piece of paper with a stamp on it. No, this is about giving these people the means to rebuild their lives in a safe environment. The figures speak for themselves. In 2010, only 4 700 refugees were resettled in the European Union, which is 4.4% of all those who were resettled during that year. In respect of this somewhat poor record – for that is what it is – let us remember that this programme is aimed at encouraging the Member States to join the collective solidarity movement to which countries like the United States and Canada are already broadly committed. Figures aside, however, it is also the actual content of resettlement and the quality of the European scheme that matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This scheme must be based on a number of essential elements. I will mention three: a clear definition of the selection criteria based on notions of vulnerability and protection needs; satisfactory reception conditions as well as access to health care, in particular in the area of mental health, to help refugees get back on their feet; and access to employment or training, along with language lessons to help them become more independent as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are constantly being bombarded with austerity talk, and the argument that it would cost far too much to accommodate refugees. I should like to take this opportunity to point out that if we do not get ourselves out of this stalemate, the money available in the European Refugee Fund could well be unusable by 2013. This just does not make sense.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union has responsibilities which it can no longer evade. The Member States must commit themselves to making more places available. Good intentions are no longer enough. They must be translated into action.</p>

      <p sl="es">The issue is not whether we should use a procedure based partially on codecision, as proposed by the Council, or the ordinary legislative procedure proposed by this House. The really important matter is to help those who most need it and to ensure the priority regions are chosen promptly so that the ultimate aim of helping persecuted and deprived people can be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, victims of ill-treatment almost by definition come from countries in which ill-treatment is routinely dispensed. It might be tempting to see perpetrators and victims as quite different people. However, victims, when they get the opportunity, very quickly become perpetrators. We have seen this behavioural transition in Libya recently. Rebel soldiers representing the victims of Gaddafi have been found to be as keen as mustard to deal out arbitrary beatings, torture and summary execution to Gaddafi and his men when they fall into rebel hands.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we give sanctuary to people from countries that routinely dispense injustice, are we importing the very behaviour that we condemn and from which asylum-seekers are supposedly fleeing? It all depends on whether you see distinct peoples as the product of distinct cultures or you see distinct cultures as the product of distinct peoples.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in contrast to many of the participants in the debate here, I view the establishment of this resettlement programme as problematic, ineffective and also as not in line with the Qualification Directive, because this Directive gives priority to internal protection in parts of the country from which the refugee comes.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it would be better to use the resources from the fund to provide local assistance. That assistance would be quick and effective. It would help the refugees to remain close to their place of origin, and it would also help them to return to their place of origin if peace and security returned to the region. I consider that to be a priority. I regard the consideration of such an option here to be significantly more effective than holding a debate on formalities.</p>

More could have been done if the emergency mechanism supported by the European Parliament had been in operation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, as we are aware, the procedure for adopting the report on the European Refugee Fund has been blocked. The Council has failed to respond yet to the latest proposal tabled in June. The reasons for this delay need to be resolved, no matter what they are.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, some Member States have been carrying out resettlement for quite a few years. That is excellent and we hope that they will continue to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The point of a joint European resettlement programme is of course to pool those resources so that we can make a real difference: for instance, empty a refugee camp or make a real effort to alleviate a very difficult situation in our neighbourhood or elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current events in our neighbourhood have shown the importance of this, but I am sure that in the future there will unfortunately also be a need for this. We can do more in the European Union. As someone mentioned, the US and Canada are doing a lot more and we should do more to take up this challenge. Hopefully Member States will join. If they see that there is a regional resettlement programme that really works, more Member States will join in and it will have even more effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is of course political will. If there is no political will we can have the best system and programme in the world but that will not help. But hopefully that political will will also exist. There are already possibilities today to support resettlement. We have funding from the European Commission and within the regional protection programme there is also a possibility to assist the most vulnerable. We should do everything we can to have this programme in place so that in the future we are better prepared with a more flexible but still a rapid programme that could efficiently enter into force when there is a need.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again, the Commission will do its utmost to try to find, in the different compromises that are now circulating, something that all the stakeholders could really find an agreement on and that can be put in place as soon as possible.

We do however ultimately expect that the forthcoming Commission proposal on establishing the Asylum and Migration Fund for 2014-2020 will enable Parliament and the Council to achieve extensive improvement of cooperation in this field, taking into account past experience and the undoubtedly growing needs arising from the situation in particular regions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety here in the European Parliament, in the ‘citizens’ chamber’ of the European Union, is tabling a motion for a resolution in order to raise awareness of the threat to public health caused by the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and to call on the Commission and the Member States to establish an action programme to combat this threat to public health. I am the Chair of the committee, not the author of this resolution, and you can see that we had sponsors from all political parties. We are in agreement in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we have a ticking time bomb here, a major problem for the health of our citizens, and that there is an urgent need for action. We need an action plan, because the health authorities in Europe are alarmed. During visits this year to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London and also to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, our attention was once again drawn by these specialist agencies of the European Union to this problem in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the EU, around 25 000 people a year are now dying of infections caused by resistant bacteria. If we look at the situation, up to the end of the 1970s there was a great deal of activity in the pharmaceuticals industry aimed at developing new molecules and new agents. Since the end of the 1970s, the activity has diminished and come to a standstill. So, if you like, we stopped focusing on this problem 40 years ago. We are simply lacking new agents to fight this resistance. Commissioner Dalli, at this point the first demand that I am going to make is directed at you as the Commissioner responsible, and it is a call on the Commission to draw up a road map with the industry concerned in order to show more commitment to the search for and development of new molecules and new agents. Together with the actors involved in research and industry, you should draw up this road map so that we can obtain a new protection mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have mentioned a second issue, with regard to which we would ask you – as well as the Member States – to be actively engaged. Antibiotics help to reduce diseases, but if they are not used properly they can also cause damage. We have discovered that antibiotics are used entirely differently in the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Eurobarometer survey has shown how much ignorance there is. Of the people questioned, 53% believe that antibiotics kill viruses and 43% believe that antibiotics are effective against colds and flu. We can imagine how great the misuse of these substances must be, which then contributes to the resistance and puts other people at risk. We are therefore calling on the Commission to define general principles and best practices for the prudent use of antibiotics for 500 million people, for all 27 Member States, and also to ensure that these guidelines are actually implemented and put into practice everywhere in the European Union. We need a major awareness campaign in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that we also need a well-functioning monitoring and surveillance system in this sector. The ECDC in Stockholm is our sectoral authority. We need good data, sound surveys and, of course, also analyses of trends and early warnings of the spread of such resistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, there is one final issue that we have addressed in a serious way: the cross-transmission of resistance from animals to humans. Antibiotics are used in veterinary medicine as well as human medicine. There are strong indications that crossovers exist. That means that we need cooperation with veterinary medicine in this regard, above all in order to reduce and prohibit the prophylactic use of antibiotics in intensive livestock farming.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, Commissioner, I hope that our resolution will also serve as a mandate for you as well as for the Polish Presidency to take action so that we can protect our citizens against this new threat to health.</p>

    <intervention id="3-289-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Adam Fronczak" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, one of the greatest challenges facing modern medicine and public health is the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of key pathogenic bacteria. Since the end of the 1990s, the problem of drug-resistant microorganisms has been growing at an alarming pace and giving rise to yet more clinical, epidemiological, socio-economic and political problems. A rise is being observed in the number of patients with increased susceptibility to infections with bacteria which are normally non-pathogenic for healthy people and in the number of people in care institutions, who constitute a significant reservoir of resistance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This situation is exacerbated by a fall in the interest of pharmaceutical firms in antibiotics which would be effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria. The effective treatment and control of commonly-occurring bacterial infections may be increasingly difficult in the future. The most urgent action which needs to be taken to combat the phenomenon of increasing drug resistance is to invest in scientific programmes aimed at developing new antibiotics and new strategies. The very strict registration requirements, the huge costs of conducting clinical studies and what the pharmaceutical industry considers to be insufficient profits have caused pharmaceutical firms to abandon work on new drugs over the last 20 years, and this has been extremely negligent. I would like to add that only two new molecules have been approved for therapeutic use in that period. Antimicrobial resistance is far from being a new phenomenon. The increasingly frequent occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of new resistant strains represent a serious threat to public health. This situation was recognised by the Council as long ago as 1999, when it adopted a resolution entitled ‘A strategy against the microbial threat’ and conclusions on future actions in the framework of the strategy against antimicrobial resistance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In many of the European Union’s Member States, strains of bacteria have emerged which are resistant to all available drugs. The list of these pathogens is constantly getting longer. We should not expect to see the approval of new and effective drugs against these bacteria in the near future. At least 10 years will be needed to achieve this. Infection with a drug-resistant microorganism significantly reduces the options for proven and safe therapy and requires the use of what are called ‘last-chance’ drugs, which have been failing with increasing frequency recently. Treatment with these antibiotics often has no scientific basis and leads to an increase in the number of adverse reactions and treatment failures. The increase in the costs of the health care needed by patients with multidrug-resistant microbial infections has many aspects. As well as the costs associated with the antibiotic therapy itself, there are also the costs of other drugs which are used in conjunction with these antibiotics, the costs of treating patients in intensive care units and the costs of infection control measures such as microbiological diagnosis, patient isolation and assigning personnel to care for individual patients. When hospital stays need to be extended it is not just the costs of health care which rise, because there are also greater costs associated with people being unfit for work for longer periods.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Since 2001, a huge amount of work has been done in the field of combating antibiotic resistance. I would like to mention several examples. Firstly, the second report from the Commission to the Council on the implementation of the Council recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, published in April 2010. This report contained an account of the progress made by the Member States under the many different initiatives undertaken since publication of the first report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, specialised agencies of the European Union, and in particular the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Medicines Agency and the European Food Safety Authority are working closely together in this area. For example, two Europe-wide surveillance networks are currently in existence: EARS-NET, the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network, and ESAC, European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption, which monitors consumption in human and to a small extent in veterinary medicine.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, a series of measures has been put in place to fight antimicrobial resistance related to the food chain. For example, European Union law on feeding animals has prohibited the use of growth-stimulating antibiotics in animal feed since January 2006. Also being monitored are trends in antimicrobial resistance in animal disease and in infections transmitted from animals to humans and other factors which might pose a threat to public health.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, at international level the European Union supported the adoption of a European strategic action plan on antibiotic resistance at the meeting of the Regional Committee for Europe of the World Health Organisation which was held in September this year. Together with the United States we have also set up the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the question of the prudent use of antibiotics, the Council has invited the Member States several times to take action intended to ensure the prudent use of authorised antimicrobial agents in human and veterinary medicine, in particular in the conclusions on antimicrobial resistance adopted in June 2008. In these conclusions, the Council called on the Member States to strengthen surveillance systems and improve the quality of data on antimicrobial resistance and the use of antimicrobial agents, and also to promote the prudent use of antibiotics in both the human and veterinary sectors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Development of new antimicrobial agents and the significant role played by systems which encourage investment in research are questions which are being considered by the Council. In its conclusions on innovative incentives for effective antibiotics adopted in December 2009, the Council called upon the Member States to strengthen incentives to conduct research and development of new effective antibiotics. It also called upon the Member States and the Commission to facilitate the development of new antibiotics for which a particular need exists in medicine and also to identify appropriate regulatory instruments to facilitate early approval for new antibiotics.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, what is being planned for the future? All legislative proposals will be based on initiatives from the Commission. I am sure that Mr Dalli will want to say more about his plans for the future in this area. Naturally, the Council will consider favourably all proposals submitted by the Commission. The question of antimicrobial resistance will continue to be a priority for the Council. As far back as 2009, the Council asked the Commission to submit, before the end of 2011, a comprehensive action plan containing specific proposals for incentives to develop new effective antibiotics. We are expecting publication of this document next month. In addition, the forthcoming United States-European Union summit has plans for agreements concerning future cooperation in this area too.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The subject of antibiotic resistance is particularly significant from the point of view of the Council, and so it has been included in the catalogue of priorities of the Danish Presidency, our partners in the Trio. The Danish Presidency has planned a conference on the use of antibiotics, which will be held on 14-15 March next year. The conference will discuss the challenges and threats associated with antibiotic use.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to note that this House, too, is planning to adopt a resolution on the public health threat of antimicrobial resistance. This will be a continuation of a previous resolution adopted in May, which focussed more on the use of antimicrobial agents in animals. These initiatives show clearly that the Council and the European Parliament are equally interested in this matter and that they also have the same objective: to halt the spread of microorganisms which are resistant to first-line antibiotics and to develop new antibiotics which are effective against resistant strains. In closing my speech, I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to you, the Members of the European Parliament, for discussing this issue – one which is so important for the health of the European Union’s citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission shares the concern expressed in the draft report as regards antimicrobial resistance and has already taken action to address this important threat to health.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission plans to strengthen action in support of Member States in this area and will present, next month, a five-year action plan on antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

      <p sl="en">The broad aims will be to mitigate the risk of developing AMR in humans through promotion of the prudent use of antimicrobials, to help Member States address the issue of sales of antibiotics without prescription, to support Member States’ enforcement of the prescription-only requirements for antibiotics and to address the identified shortfalls through new activities, such as guidelines, exchange of best practices, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the veterinary sector in particular the issue of AMR will be addressed in the context of the review of the legal framework for veterinary medicines and medicated feeding stuffs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in 1945, Alexander Fleming already feared the excessive use of antibiotics and said the following: ‘Instead of fighting infection, the risk would be that germs learn to resist penicillin and that those same germs would then be transmitted from one individual to another and lead to an infection that penicillin could not cure.’ Well, that is the problem we now face, as the 25 000 deaths recorded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control each year show. Therefore we now need a comprehensive solution, and I fully agree with our Chair, Jo Leinen, who is calling for further research and development in the pharmaceutical industry in order to find new antibiotics. We have been waiting several decades for the discovery of new molecules and new active ingredients.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I feel it is particularly important for us to control how these antibiotics are used, within human medicine and veterinary medicine alike. We urgently need to set daily consumption levels in the various sectors of livestock farming. Indeed we are starting to find antibiotic residue in meat and in milk, and this has been confirmed by various experts. How can we conceive of giving such food to our children?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly this residue will find its way onto consumers’ plates and will encourage the emergence of resistance. Consequently we need to raise awareness among livestock farmers and technicians of the effects that excessive use of these antibiotics can have, especially since we are aware of the risk of cross-transmission from animals to humans. In this respect we have a responsibility towards our fellow citizens. I say that on behalf of my fellow Members in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are worried and who certainly share the same concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, Commissioner, we await your plan with a great deal of interest, for we are dealing here with a real public health problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when a delegation from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety went to the European Medicines Agency a few weeks ago, we were told that this issue is a top priority for the Medicines Agency: 25 000 EU citizens are dying every year from conditions which used to be treated with antibiotics which are no longer effective. I have someone very close to me who had a little boy who was ill for many months with something which would have been routinely treated with antibiotics just a few years ago. So we know it is a problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know the main cause is overuse of antibiotics and misuse of antibiotics by humans – people not taking their antibiotics to the end of their course. But I just want to say one thing. We have had a lot of lobbying over the last few days – and Ms Grossetête has mentioned this – from companies which make veterinary medicines. They are saying that the science suggesting a link between veterinary medicines and human health is not proved. That is not what the European Medicines Agency says; that is not what the ECDC tells us; that is not what the World Health Organisation tells us. So, Commissioner, I am very pleased that you are going to bring forward a plan which looks at human health, how doctors prescribe and where we can exchange best practice between our doctors and our health services, but which will also look at animal feed and veterinary practices and veterinary medicines. We do need to get this right. We are also revising the common agricultural policy, and we need to look at more sustainable methods of farming as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We look forward to your plan. I think we will need some incentives for pharmaceutical companies, to help them bring forward the right kind of antibiotics. This is an urgent issue, and that is why we wanted to make sure this was on the agenda today in this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, no one expected a tsunami to hit Fukushima. Hardly anyone foresaw the economic crisis in 2008. Our societies are not well-prepared for outlier events. This applies above all to antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, given that, in the Darwinian sense, the development of a superbug resistant to modern antibiotics was only a matter of time.</p>
      <p sl="el">Antimicrobial resistance is a problem which clearly has cross-border dimensions. That is why the Treaty of Lisbon makes provision for the European Union to have competence and an obligation to act in this sector. Our defence in this instance is as strong as its weakest link. We must therefore focus on the countries with high levels of antimicrobial resistance and address the question of excessive use with interventions along the entire chain of citizens, doctors, chemists and the pharmaceutical industry. This will have very important economic and financial implications, because antibiotics are expensive.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why Parliament’s vote in favour of a special action – which I proposed – within the framework of the 2012 budget, to extend research into the social and economic causes of indiscriminate use and to help plan an action programme in the most vulnerable countries, is a positive move.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must also acknowledge that there has been market failure, especially in terms of research and development of new antibiotics. As antibiotics are the last line of defence and must be used very economically, there is quite logically no incentive to develop them. That is why we must step up the debate and find such incentives.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, the key to the endeavour is to limit the widespread use of so-called broad spectrum antibiotics. It is absurd to use weapons of mass destruction where we can use smart bombs. That is why we are calling for more investment here.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, we need to understand that, in practical terms, antimicrobial resistance wastes global resources that are non-renewable. That is why the Commission needs to table proposals and move ahead with the Council recommendation of November 2001 and ensure that it is applied more effectively.</p>

I am pleased with the motion for a resolution, which concerns a serious problem affecting human health. However, I am pleased, too, that the motion has taken note of the problem of large industrial farms and the threat associated with the use of antibiotics on the animals raised on these farms. These farms are very often operated under scandalous conditions; the animals there are crowded together, deprived of space and deprived of movement; they fight each other and are weakened, and – to keep them alive – they are stuffed with antibiotics. Then their meat becomes food for people, with all the adverse consequences this entails.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, what the Commissioner has just said gives us hope because, if we do nothing, antibiotics will prove to be, not a prolonger of, but a threat to life. Every year, 25,000 people die in the EU of conditions which are untreatable because bacteria in their bodies have become resistant to antimicrobial agents.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are not weighing up the medicine correctly and are dispensing it for the wrong purposes. You ought only to be able to get antibiotics on prescription from a qualified physician for a specific problem. But this is not working the way it should. Half of the population already wrongly knocks back antibiotics for a touch of flu or a cold. It is not just ill people that are prescribed antibiotics by doctors; we also have healthy people ingesting them with their food, when they eat meat which has been intentionally laced with them, because antibiotics are added to animal feed for preventive purposes. Now, what is perverse about this situation is that our cattle breeders risk facing major health risks, such as the aggressive MRSA bacterium.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have been turning a blind eye to the side effects for too long, as well as to the long-term side effects and the impact on the environment. We have increasingly been focusing on the current impact and on the impact on the individual but, at the same time, we have been burdening the community as a whole and our future generations with deadly consequences.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have often expressed deep-rooted criticism of the EU’s meddlesomeness, but we are talking here about a health problem which really justifies international intervention. Cross-border action is the only formula that will help contain this serious, health-threatening problem. I hope that the Council and the Commission will not show themselves immune to the action points which we, as Parliament, have drawn up, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will complete the whole course of treatment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The discovery of antimicrobial treatments in the last century was one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of medicine. Humanity found a weapon against an enemy that had formerly destroyed human lives with impunity, often in terrible epidemics. Today, however, the number of micro-organisms that are resistant to these treatments is beginning to increase dangerously. The efforts of micro-organisms to save and preserve themselves force them to adapt to the treatments in use, and if they cannot do this, they perish. Those bacteria that learn to survive in the presence of antibiotics, grow more, mutate, multiply and complicate treatment, often even causing death. They then spread to other people, particularly from hospitals. We have unfortunately not found effective new substances. Only 1.6% of treatments currently being developed are antibiotic. From this perspective, we can therefore reasonably state that we are in a stage of total antibacterial disarmament. The World Health Organisation has therefore proposed a set of measures to halt the spread of resistance to medicines. In addition to the incorrect prescribing of antimicrobial substances, specialists have also defined other factors which encourage the emergence of resistance. They draw attention in particular to incomplete national rules on the use of these medicines, and lack of compliance with these rules. The Council recommendations of 2001 on careful use of antimicrobial substances in human medicine also look deficient today in terms of practical application. I would therefore like to quote the slogan of the WHO for this year’s World Health Day, concerning the fight against antimicrobial resistance, which goes: no action today, no cure tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speaker has already clearly pointed out that the discovery of penicillin brought about a global revolution. We have seen people’s life expectancy increase by 10 years. Now we are seeing this development as a result of the emergence of resistant bacteria. We need to address this threat to health in a serious and thorough manner, in respect of both people and animals. We therefore need to do everything we can to make sure that we still have effective antimicrobial treatment options for the future. That will primarily be achieved – as has already been said today – through research.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need new agents. We would have needed these new agents even if this resistance had not developed, because, of course, a certain amount of tolerance develops in any case. However, a significant part of our efforts to address this problem must be to demand the responsible and careful use of antibiotics, both in human medicine and in veterinary medicine. That includes providing specific diagnoses in human and veterinary medicine. It requires the use of one agent to deal with one particular pathogen and not, as is currently customary in human medicine, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is what has encouraged the developments that we are talking about. If we consider hospitals, the pathogens are constantly in contact with antibiotics, and that is exactly how this resistance that we are talking about today arises.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to mention the subject of hygiene. Everywhere I go I hear that hygiene in hospitals has deteriorated. The number of pathogens is rising here, and the development of MRSA pathogens is also increasing. Obviously it is right to carry out public relations work. However, it will not help anyone if we now, prematurely and out of fear, prohibit the use of antibiotics in certain areas without being certain of the consequences. Just like human medicine, veterinary medicine also depends on the use of these agents. That is something we need to take into consideration, as well as the consequences: if we do not use them in this area, what will happen then?</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the constant criticism of intensive livestock farming, I would like to say that I am a practitioner and veterinary surgeon myself. In my experience the animals in large housing units are healthier than those in small, uncomfortable units.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, not long ago I visited the doctor, and when he discovered that I was a Member of the European Parliament he asked me directly: what are you doing to combat antibiotics resistance? Far too little, I replied, but I also said that it is probably due to the fact that health care is an issue that does not primarily fall within the EU’s sphere of competence, but rather within that of the Member States. He then merely shook his head and said that if the EU does not do something about one of the biggest threats to our lives, with regard to which we are completely dependent on one another, then what is the purpose of the EU?</p>
      <p sl="sv">I actually quite understand this reaction, and I am very pleased that we will have this resolution tomorrow and that the Commission will present a proposal. I am quite convinced that the Commission will have practical proposals for how we are to produce new antibiotics.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would therefore like to focus on something else and present a proposal that I hope you will be able to accept. One of the most important things to do, of course, is to produce comparable statistics that compare how antibiotics are used within the health-care sector in different Member States and in different regions, but also within animal husbandry in different countries, as well as how they are used for different animal species.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Based on these statistics, we would need to establish reduction targets, because there really is no reason why one country should have very high use of antibiotics and other countries should have low use. We would also have a good opportunity to analyse and learn from good examples and to see what it is that is driving up antibiotics use in certain countries compared with others.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Obviously it should be the case, as many speakers have said, that people should only be able to receive antibiotics after a doctor has issued a diagnosis and written a prescription. However, it is equally clear that it must not be possible for animals to receive antibiotics without having been examined by a veterinary surgeon who has determined what disease the animal has, and who then prescribes antibiotics for that disease. It must not be the case that antibiotics are given to animals more casually than to children who are sick.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, there are huge differences within Europe in terms of how we deal with antibiotics. Sometimes, you can draw from your own experiences and that is exactly what I am going to do here. I know from experience, from visits to doctors in Belgium and France, for example, that it seems as if those doctors do not want to disappoint you as a patient, and so you come back from the doctor with a big bag full of drugs, very often including antibiotics. To say nothing of a continent like Africa, where I was once advised to go up to a large sweet jar and take out a large handful of antibiotic pills!</p>
      <p sl="nl">The situation in my own country, the Netherlands, could not be more different. There, we are very careful about using antibiotics in humans. You almost have to go down on your knees and beg your doctor just to get some medicine for your illness, for heaven’s sake. On the other hand, farm animals in the Netherlands do not need to go down on their knees to beg for drugs: oh no, drugs are being pressed on them. They are given large amounts of unsolicited antibiotics without anybody asking their permission first. Unfortunately, the Netherlands has championed the use of antibiotics in animals.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ms McAvan has just talked about the strong lobby of people who are raising questions about the link between the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and resistance, which is now also affecting people. In the Netherlands, pig farmers and their families and people working on pig farms are treated in isolation wards in hospitals. Simply because of the risk of bacterial resistance. The risk is that high. The risks are so high that we should not allow this to run its course. I am therefore really pleased that Mr Dalli from the Commission is planning to come up with a very ambitious proposal. I hope that, after 18 November, this will be followed with firm legislation because, unfortunately, we cannot just leave this to Member States.</p>

I would just like to ask him to ensure that there is a clear presentation and clear analysis of the scientific data in that report, so that we do not have to keep having these discussions about whether the data is good or bad. Let us have some really good, clear stuff from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to address a few remarks to the issue of veterinary use. We have heard about how difficult it is to get funding for research for new products for humans. It is doubly difficult in the case of animals. I totally agree that we should be promoting high standards of animal husbandry, but this is not just about high-intensity farming. The logic of a phase-out programme for prophylactics is absolutely clear, but may I please urge caution against a complete prohibition of such use. As a livestock farmer sometimes surrounded by infection, you do need to have that particular weapon in your armoury, albeit to be used sparingly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I believe this debate is of paramount importance, and I would like to thank those who took the initiative of holding it. Resistance to antimicrobials and antibiotics, in particular, is a growing problem. The 25 000 deaths that occur annually in the EU cannot be justified by any means, and it is just as critical that many people end up trying to treat their health problems and die due to the cure, because they are affected by resistant bacteria. This is why health care, not being a business, cannot be dependent on interest or lack thereof from the pharmaceutical industry when developing new medicines.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is merely a symptom, and a symptom of two things in particular: firstly, it is a symptom of the lack of public investment in this area and of the abuse of antibiotics; and secondly, and I would like to highlight this in particular, it is a symptom of the food industry and the way it has been using antibiotics. Therefore, as this is a public health problem, an economic problem, a social problem and a clinical problem, we have to go much further than producing new medicines.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What is at stake here is new research and new innovation. I apologise for repeating myself, but we should also be able to work better in terms of preventing and moderating our use of antibiotics. All initiatives are therefore welcome; although it is late in the day, they may still be effective.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the initiators. This is indeed an important resolution. Ms Grossetête, that is something that I would like to say to you, and I would also like to thank you for your willingness to speak and for your concession.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also stand here as a farmer, I would just like to make that clear. However, I would also like to say that I am not your enemy. We understand and respect the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for health, obviously has people’s health in mind first and foremost. I would also say to you that we in the agricultural sector also have questions. On 12 May this year, the farmers among us also tabled a resolution, which received broad agreement and discussed the same issues. However, it should not just be about the health and well-being of people. We also need to consider the health and well-being of animals. Commissioner, you are also presenting a strategic plan for animals, as that is part of your job, too. That is also something that we need to consider. It is important – and we agree in many respects: we must limit the use of antibiotics, but we must not prohibit them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say one thing: I come from Germany. No farmer can use antibiotics in Germany without it first being approved by a veterinary surgeon and also documented. The documentation has to be retained and it has to be submitted. We will continue to need prophylactic antibiotics. Mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary tissue, is extremely painful for an animal. I am now speaking to the women here, one or two of whom may perhaps understand what I am talking about.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, you have important tasks to do. I would urge you first to reveal what is happening in hospitals, how medicines are prescribed to people and for animals, how this is controlled and what is happening with regard to plants – because antibiotics are also relevant to plants, of course. However, please consider pets, too, and tell me how many antibiotics are given to pets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am not able to give a clear answer to the question about pets and quantities, but as a starting point perhaps I could give you a few figures, without mentioning the countries concerned, just to give an indication of the scale: a country with a population of around 8 million uses 45 tonnes of antibiotics in human medicine and around 60 tonnes in veterinary medicine, a country with a population of 80 million uses 360 tonnes in human medicine and 780 tonnes in veterinary medicine, and for a population of 160 million the figure is 760 tonnes. This means that approximately twice the amount of antibiotics is used in veterinary medicine. We have very clear indications that where more antibiotics are used, those strains also develop resistance. The Commissioner knows very well that he needs to consider these things together. However, I am convinced that today’s resolution is not intended to be a criticism of anybody in particular, but rather to signify an area of cooperation for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the individual Member States, we now have very good programmes for monitoring how medicines are used and dispensed. However, we need coordination and monitoring of the effects. We have already mentioned broad-spectrum antibiotics today. This is a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In 1928, we had the wonderful discovery of penicillin and we regarded it as the super weapon to fight all infectious diseases. We now know that this weapon is no longer effective in many areas, because we – animals and people – are resistant.</p>
      <p sl="de">I consider it to be an important task of the European Union not to leave the individual Member States to deal with this alone; instead we should combine our strength, knowledge and interests and work on the problem together, because – as has already been said today – if we do not succeed in finding a coordinated approach, the result will be a superbug. We do not want to arouse fear and we do not want to blame anyone; we simply want to find ways out of this crisis. We want there to be a super agent to fight infectious diseases in future, too.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since their discovery, antibiotics have played a major role in the treatment of infectious diseases in human and veterinary medicine. However, the super weapon seems to be losing its effectiveness. I agree with the authors of the motion for a resolution that we need to be more prudent and more careful with antimicrobial agents. The aim must be to limit the use of antibiotics to the essential curing of infections. We also need incentives for further research and development of new agents and alternative solutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is vital that we all pull in the same direction.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is the second time in the last six months that we have discussed antibiotic resistance here: once at the initiative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and once at the initiative of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Now, you might conclude from that that we all consider this a very urgent issue, and that would be a fine conclusion. However, what you might also read into that is that we are, perhaps, far too split on this issue. That is precisely where, in my opinion, we could put a finger on the sore spot. Our approach to this problem has been far too fragmented. This has become a livestock farming-versus-public health kind of debate, but both are inextricably linked and only an integral approach will provide us with a solution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That said, let us give credit where credit is due. This resolution does look at all the aspects but, in my view, it could have been more robust on certain points. I will first discuss livestock farming. It has rightly been pointed out that, despite some small steps forward, the use of antibiotics in livestock farming is still too high. In my native country, in the Netherlands, we have got all the stakeholders together round the table, from farmers to supermarkets, and together agreed to reduce the amount of antibiotics by 20% this year and by 50% in 2013. That is an ambitious target, Commissioner, and perhaps also an inspiration for the plans you are going to propose.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moving next to antibiotic use in humans. In my opinion, the text is still far too soft on that issue. We have to monitor, we have to provide information, yes, that is all well and good, but it is a simple fact that selling antibiotics without a prescription is prohibited, pure and simple. Research has shown that, in some Member States, that prohibition is still being massively circumvented by pharmacies which are offering these products directly to consumers, including in cases where they do not have a prescription. We are rightly demanding considerable efforts from livestock farmers, but we are not going to resolve the problem of antibiotic resistance as long as people in Europe, in some Member States, continue to run to the pharmacy at the very first sign of a cold – and that is where I actually agree with the speaker from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left – straight to the pharmacy for our next dose.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am therefore pleased, Commissioner. We have often been at loggerheads in this Chamber, but on this occasion I am pleased with your proposal and, indeed, we could work to give it even more bite.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are all firmly of the belief that resistance to antibiotics is a life-threatening risk: pneumonias that can no longer be treated, hospitals struggling with MRSA cases, outbreaks of the EHEC virus. On that we agree. You have said that it will be difficult for us to develop an approach, which is why I have come up with six rules for you on how to fight the development of resistance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, let us stop prescribing antibiotics for preventive purposes. Instead, let us only prescribe them for curative purposes and, therefore, only administer antibiotics if the animal is ill, and then only the animal concerned and not, in the first instance, the whole barn. Treat a sick animal like a sick human. Just because one person in the European Parliament has an ear infection, it does not mean that the whole plenary sitting needs a course of antibiotics.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, prohibit the sale of antibiotics by veterinary surgeons directly to farmers. Make sure pharmacies, the middlemen, are properly informed that they should only dispense antibiotics on prescription. In Denmark, this has led to a direct and immediate decline in use.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, that will lead to greater supervision, which brings me to my third point: proper statistics for the use and prescription of antibiotics. We need statistics for individual diseases, individual animals and individual regions. That will enable us to draw comparisons, including when it comes to human diseases, and then we will have a greater insight into the possible transmission of diseases from animals to people and into the development of resistance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fourthly, introduce a leader system. A reduction to minimum health and safety standards. That will enable us to find out what a safe minimum standard is. We need all Member States to comply with that health and safety minimum standard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fifthly, be fully committed to research. It appears that only five of the fifteen leading global pharmaceutical companies are involved in antibiotics research. We have an ambition to become a Union of Innovation and that means that we have to prevent fragmentation and duplication. Let us fully commit to research and explore the possible alternatives.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, put an end to intensive livestock farming, change our meat-eating habits, because that is where it all starts. That is the long and short of it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a serious problem. Ms Grossetête has already said many times that we need to take very clear action now so that we do not at some point move into a post-antibiotics era. I very much welcome the fact that the Commission is also going to submit plans for combating antibiotics resistance this year.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, the Commission’s plans should take into account four particularly important issues. Firstly, the rather casual use of antibiotics in human medicine. Veterinary medicine is certainly important, but the fact that we have antibiotics resistance in humans is primarily down to the casual use of antibiotics in humans. Therefore, we really need to be more sensible in this regard, for example provide more accurate diagnoses before we treat people. We need to know which pathogen is involved so that we can treat the person in a targeted way.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second issue is that multi-resistant bacteria need to be identified, for example in patients who have been taken to hospital, so that these pathogens do not spread there with dangerous consequences.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third issue is livestock breeding and veterinary medicine. There is a connection here. We have been assured of this once again by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It is not the main problem and it does not involve all pathogens. It exists, however, and therefore we need to monitor it very carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fourth issue is that we need to encourage the industry and in so doing also consider new, innovative rules for how we can place new antibiotics on the market, because the industry is faced with a dilemma in that it might invests half a billion euros in the development of a new antibiotic, and then we say: ‘because it is a reserve antibiotic, it has to be placed in a safe and you must not actually use it’. It is not a particularly good business model to pay out a lot of money for something that later is not permitted to be sold.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need new solutions for this. We are confident that the Commission will include all of these solutions in the action plan.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, the precautionary principle is enshrined in our European Constitution, in the Treaty of Lisbon. That is simply because, in the history of mankind, we often had early warning signs of impending disasters, but failed to act promptly and suffered drastic consequences as a result.</p>
      <p sl="el">Antibiotics are a typical example. We already have the first signs and now is the time for immediate action.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am delighted that the Commission is preparing a proposal on how we should take coordinated action on this risk at EU level and I trust that this proposal will manage to cover all the important points.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, antibiotic resistance is a very serious medical problem in Europe. People are dying from nosocomial infections and MRA – and nothing can stop these killer bugs. In the past, useless over-prescribing by doctors (and I happen to be one of them) of antibiotics for viral infections was blamed, but in recent years the issue of massive doses being given in animal feeds as growth promoters was also blamed and investigated and the practice was eventually banned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we need to look again at the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis in animal husbandry. Sometimes it is used to mask poor animal welfare and hygiene, which is clearly unacceptable. However, it is logical that overuse of antibiotics by farmers and vets will eventually lead to microbial resistance in human pathogens. We therefore need more scientific research to settle this controversial issue, but in the meantime I urge farmers and vets to be very cautious.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the studies carried out by STOA – the European Parliament’s Scientific and Technology Options Assessment – indicate that the level of coordination and cooperation in the area of research and innovation involving medicines is insufficient and that health matters are not dealt with adequately in European research programmes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These studies present the following recommendations: to develop a portal enabling access to all documents and legislative provisions relating to the use of antibiotics which are applicable in Member States; to develop a database containing all national and European antimicrobial resistance initiatives, both in terms of policies and specific research projects; to encourage policies on the use of prescription-only antibiotics in all Member States; to channel research funds into reducing antimicrobial resistance and into discovering new medicines; to support rapid diagnostic methods, and to develop a voluntary European accreditation scheme to incorporate European and international hygiene and health standards.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the participants in this debate. What can I say? I am greatly invigorated by the comments that I have heard from all sides of this Chamber and I can say that at present we are finalising the communication that will be presented to the European Parliament and to the Council – unless we find unexpected hitches – on 17 November. I hope that will lead to a creative debate and a concrete plan of action that will see us fight and reduce antimicrobial resistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Basically – and I am not going to repeat the various comments that have been made in this House – the issue is prudent use and research. Prudent use in the human health sphere, both through the discipline of practitioners in prescribing (and I totally agree that we have to move to prescription-only antibiotics) and in the case of patients, who have to be educated in how to use antibiotic medicines. The misuse of antibiotics, even if prescribed, can lead to a continuation of this hazard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning animal husbandry, I believe that we are realising that this is a key issue and that the abuse of antibiotics in veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed is one cause of the problems that we are facing today. Therefore I believe that concrete action in this regard is also going to be called for.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning research, what I can say is that the Commission is fully committed to exploring, with all relevant stakeholders, how to ensure the development of new effective antimicrobials, stimulate antimicrobial development and promote and support research and innovation in this area. We are already in preliminary discussions on this issue, and I hope that we can pull together all European resources to really concentrate and focus on fighting this and creating new medicines as new antibiotics. But I have to remind this House – and I have to remind everybody – that creating new molecules, new medicine, is not the solution. It is the appropriate use of antibiotics that is the solution to this problem.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you all for a productive discussion on antibiotic resistance. Resistance to antibiotics concerns all microorganisms and all antibiotics, but the greatest threat is posed by the group of what are known as ‘alert pathogens’. Therefore, all possible measures should be put in place to enable the activity of currently-available antibiotics to be maintained for as long as possible. I agree with Ms Grossetête of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who thinks that controlling the use of antibiotics in veterinary and human medicine is one of the most important measures which can be used with regard to reducing the problem of drug resistance. I agree, too, with the statements made by Ms McAvan of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and Mr Skylakakis of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and also with what was said by Mr Wojciechowski of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, who drew attention to the poor conditions of production on large industrial farms. The contributions of the other speakers are also helpful in building a strategy and showing the way forward, and can certainly be used as a foundation for further action by the Council and also, I think, by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, the Member States need to strengthen the intersectoral system for coordinating implementation of national strategy on preventing the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and for exchanging information and coordinating work in this area with the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and other Member States. It is also essential to ensure greater coordination of the work of laboratories which monitor drug-resistant bacterial infections and to facilitate the creation of a platform for the exchange and processing of data obtained from monitoring. To this end, it is necessary to set up a European network of reference laboratories which monitor resistance to antibiotics and carry out molecular typing for epidemiological purposes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, it is extremely important to intensify basic research on drug resistance, cooperation between primary and reference laboratories, and ongoing training in the area of rational antibiotic therapy and infection control for people working in the medical and related professions. In view of the importance of the current situation, European Union measures should be put in place in several different areas, such as intensification of the monitoring of drug-resistant bacterial infections and antibiotic consumption, research into reservoirs of resistance in man and in animals raised in the wild, development of basic research, and education of people working in the medical and related professions and of all of society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In closing, I would like to say I am sure that the Danish Presidency will facilitate a thorough and in-depth discussion in this area, and the solutions it proposes will become Council Conclusions and be adopted at the meeting of ministers of health to be held in June 2012. We are waiting for the very important document which Mr Dalli has said will be presented next month and which will also provide a basis for further intensive work for the good of the whole of society.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The rapidly growing resistance of bacteria to antimicrobials is a really worrying issue. This is illustrated clearly by the fact that each year at least 25 000 patients in the EU die from infections caused by bacteria which are resistant to many drugs, and that as a result of the infections these cause, the EU faces additional healthcare expenditure every year and losses amounting to approximately EUR 1.5 billion. Undoubtedly, there is a need for complex measures which would help address the issue of antimicrobial resistance and which would cover monitoring and strengthening control of the use of authorised antimicrobials for humans and animals, increase incentives to find new antimicrobials and reduce the chance of resistance spreading from animals to humans through the food chain or direct contact. This phenomenon clearly has cross-border implications, and therefore I share this concern over the use of antimicrobials and wish to draw attention to a series of shortfalls and gaps in the promotion of the prudent use of antimicrobials which were identified by the latest Eurobarometer survey and encourage the European Commission to investigate trends relating to inappropriate antimicrobial use and to present as soon as possible a legislative package for combating antimicrobial resistance which would promote initiatives for responsible use and appropriate information for consumers.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I firstly wanted to outline our oral question to the Commission. It is, above all, a political act, an acknowledgement to the Commission that it is showing great interest in the issue of protecting and affirming children’s rights. Hence, on 15 February this year, Ms Reding presented a Communication on the European Union’s Programme on Children’s Rights, a package of 11 concrete actions that the Commission intends to adopt in the coming years to ensure greater legal protection for children, so that all 27 Member States will ensure justice for children.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will list some of the measures. First of all, the proposal for a directive on the rights of victims, which is already in discussion in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and has among its objectives the protection of child victims in criminal proceedings. Other important points include the protection of Roma children, the activation in all free states of telephone helplines and early warning systems for missing children, not to mention a commitment to open a sort of information desk for children on the Parliament and EU website. These are some of the points that make up the package I mentioned. It is important to be aware of the extraordinary efforts that the Commission and individual Commissioners are putting into the protection of children’s rights, both within the European Union and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will now set out the proposal for a directive, for which I am the rapporteur, on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. I should first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Sippel, Ms Lambert, Ms Wikström, Mr Triantaphyllides and Mr Kirkhope, who have helped me on this journey, which has not always been easy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Above all I should like to thank Ms Malmström, who was a strong supporter of this directive, the Council, the Hungarian and the Polish rotating presidencies, which followed this legislative process very carefully, as well as all the non-governmental organisations (NGOs), beginning with UNICEF, ECPAT, Save the Children, and all the main NGOs that followed and assisted us in putting this directive together. To reiterate: this is the second criminal law measure since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, following the directive on human trafficking, and the first legislative measure on a specific area of criminal law, namely the protection of children against sexual exploitation, abuse and child pornography. Among other things, the directive brings together all the outcomes of a resolution that was adopted in Parliament in 2009 and takes the Lanzarote Convention as its point of reference.</p>
      <p sl="it">A few key points: How do we define these crimes? The text defines the crimes of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, child pornography and child grooming for sexual purposes. We added a specific definition of child pornography, making reference to the Lanzarote Convention. Furthermore, uniform and effective punishments are introduced across the European Union and aggravating circumstances are specified, in particular when a child is in a vulnerable situation, disabled or if the crime has perhaps been committed by a relative or someone who has any case abused their position of trust and authority. Turning now to disqualification, anyone who has committed a crime and been definitively convicted shall have their actions restricted and will also be banned from carrying out voluntary work with children. We have provided for the seizure and confiscation of assets and proceeds connected to the crimes set out in this directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Much has also been done in the areas of assistance for victims, in order to avoid so-called double victimisation; sex tourism; grooming, by which I mean the online solicitation of children; and, lastly, we have provided for the removal of all online child pornography. I will conclude by saying that obviously this is not a matter of censoring freedom of expression and freedom of opinion: only content that objectively contains images of violence and exploitation will be removed, that much is certain.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, when an adult sexually abuses a child it is a horrendous crime that results in trauma for the child and will affect the rest of his or her life. The brutal violation often does not end when the perpetrator has finished and moved on. Soon images and video clips are posted on the Internet showing the assault over and over again.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the directive that we are to vote on now, the EU takes strong line against both of these types of crime, that is to say those that happen in real life and those that occur on the Internet. After long and difficult negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the European Parliament can now be pleased that it has a well thought-out legislative proposal, which for the first time in the EU’s history requires the Member States to prosecute child sex tourists who commit crimes in a country outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Angelilli, and the other shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation, which led to a result that we can all be very proud of.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It was not previously possible for an EU citizen, a Swede for example, who engages in so-called child sex tourism, in other words abuses children, outside the EU, in Thailand for example, to be prosecuted in his or her home country. At the same time, legal proceedings have very rarely been brought against the perpetrators in the country in question, in Thailand for example, and so they have been able to exploit children with impunity. The directive we are debating today will put a stop to this by requiring the Member States to prosecute any citizen who commits these horrendous crimes in a country outside Europe. This will make a significant contribution to limiting these crimes, and since the extent of these crimes is due to the fact that it has quite simply been easy to avoid punishment, fewer children will be exploited.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Abuse on the Internet can also be tackled by forcing the Member States to take measures to remove the child pornography at its source, in other words from the servers. When the websites are located in a country outside EU territory, we must be able to remove them by blocking them. Thus, we cannot guarantee that they will be removed from the servers, but we are instructing the Member States to increase their cooperation with third countries in order to obtain access to the websites. Blocking material could be a supplementary option for the Member States to use if they have not succeeded in deleting the material at source.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With the Angelilli report, the European Parliament has issued a clear message that what we cannot accept in real life, we cannot accept on the Internet, either. The work on this directive is a huge success for us all, and I would like to thank everyone once again for their cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I would first like to express my very sincere thanks for the effort which has been put into drafting the proposal for a directive on combating the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. I would like in particular to thank the Hungarian Presidency, which in its negotiations with the European Parliament was able to forge a valuable compromise. I would also like to extend very warm thanks to the European Commission, and would like to give my particular thanks here to the Commissioner, Ms Malmström. It is appropriate that I also offer particular thanks here to Ms Angelilli, who acted as rapporteur for this report. Her commitment to children is widely known, and the best confirmation of this is the fact that she serves as European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction. It is important that we have been able to make use of her experience in these difficult negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased that the Union is not falling behind developments in a changing world. It is keeping pace with threats related to the development of the modern world, threats concerning a particular kind of victim, because the defenceless child is always a specific kind of victim. We have tried to achieve solutions which are as comprehensive as possible in the directive, and it has also been possible to establish principles relating to the special treatment in criminal proceedings of persons under the age of 18 years who have been the victims of sexually-motivated crimes. On the other hand, we are introducing measures intended to reduce recidivism by creating mechanisms for working with persons who have a propensity to commit sexually-related crimes. We would not want a situation in which moving to another country could mean a lower risk of punishment for those who have committed crimes of this nature. Therefore it should be greatly appreciated that the report provides for a ban on offenders working with children which also applies if an offender moves to a different Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am extremely pleased by the fact that it has been possible to resolve the technical issue concerning correlation tables. We do not want such technical details to slow down much-needed action in an area where there was complete consensus. The route to adopting this instrument at first reading is now open. I hope the compromise which has been worked out will allow the rapid adoption of this directive. Once again I would like to express very warm thanks to all Members of the House who helped arrive at this solution, to the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency who worked on this before us and to the Commissioner, who is with us in the Chamber.</p>

    <intervention id="3-321-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will start first with the oral question. As you know, with the Treaty of Lisbon the protection of the rights of the child was introduced as an objective of the European Union and this is made legally binding by the Charter of Fundamental Rights that guarantees the protection of the rights of the child. Now we must of course step up the efforts and put some action behind these beautiful words – within the limits of EU competences – with concrete actions and concrete results. That is the aim of the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child that the Commission adopted in February this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agenda pointed out something that you have raised in your questions; the significant lack of reliable, comparable and official data on the situation of children in the Member States. This is a serious problem for the development and implementation of a genuine evidence-based policy. The Fundamental Rights Agency has carried out important work in finding indicators to help develop policies in the area of the rights of the child. Thanks to the financial support of Parliament, the Commission will also be able to carry out a pilot project on developing child rights data collection for developing evidence-based policies. I am really grateful that the Members of this House share the interest of data collection, for instance in children’s effective access to justice. With the pilot project I mentioned, we will be able to have reliable and comparable data on children’s effective access to justice from all the Member States by 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear, of course, that if we want our policies to be effective we need money. There is no specific budget line called ‘policies for children’. But there are various programmes within our budget that provide funding aimed at children. We have, for instance, the Daphne programme with a budget of EUR 117 million providing financial support to NGOs and local authorities to combat violence against children. We have the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme providing funding on children’s rights issues to national authorities and NGOs; and we have the Safer Internet Programme with a total budget of EUR 55 million aimed to empower and protect children online by awareness-raising initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the new multiannual framework programme 2014-2020, we will continue to fund policies to deliver child-friendly justice, to protect children and safeguard their rights. With a similar amount of funding as in the current generation of programmes, we will ensure a more efficient delivery for these actions and this will be achieved through streamlined programmes and a better response to the needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU agenda emphasised the importance of access to education and care services for small children. In the communication on early childhood education and care adopted earlier this year, the Commission set out key policy issues to be addressed at the European level to improve the accessibility and quality of service from birth to compulsory school age.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Council conclusions of May, the Member States were invited to analyse the current situation, to reinforce measures to improve access to high quality services and to invest in childhood education and care. The Commission will set up a thematic working group of policy-makers, academics and practitioners in early childhood education and care.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters the Commission carefully monitors the correct application of the Brussels IIa regulation which provides for common rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgment in matters of parental responsibility and cross-border parental child abduction.</p>
      <p sl="en">The correct implementation of the Hague Convention on Child Abduction is critical here. The aim of the Convention, as you know, is to restore the status quo by means of the prompt return of wrongfully removed or retained children through cooperation between central authorities. In external relations the Commission actively promotes the signature of this Convention to other countries. Child abduction and missing children is a growing and a common problem, and unfortunately it will not go away. We need to find tools to deal with this; and tools for Member States to be able to cooperate with each other in cases where a child is abducted.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have child alert systems designed especially for cases of extremely worrying disappearances of children, such as child abduction. To date a child alert system works in ten Member States and the Commission is committed to work with the other Member States so they are also rolled out in the remaining seventeen. We have been encouraging Member States to set up their own national child alert system and we support them operationally through the exchange of best practices, and financially in order to make sure that they are operational on a cross-border basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few years ago, with the financial support of Parliament, the Commission launched a pilot project aiming to introduce a child alert mechanism across Europe. This project consisted either of establishing a child alert system in those Member States or/and improving cooperation mechanisms amongst neighbouring countries. This is crucial and there are some good practices. For instance, we have the Lutte anti-disparitions d’enfants between France, Belgium and Britain that respects national sovereignty but has laid down procedures and provides the possibility to share information. Some Member States have not yet realised the values of these systems and my colleague Vice-President Reding has called on Member States who have not yet introduced child alert mechanisms to take all necessary steps for their implementation without delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">Child alert is not the only tool. We also have the 116000 hotline in Europe designed to report missing children and offer support to the families of missing children. Sixteen Member States have signed up to this and we are of course making every effort for the rest of them to join as well. We will continue to support and encourage Member States, within the powers of the Commission, to ensure protection and promotion of the rights of the child.</p>
      <p sl="en">Passing now to the Angelilli report; sexual crimes committed by adults towards children is the most horrendous form of criminality. As adults, we cannot and we should not accept this, and the report today is the proof that we will not accept it. It is a delicate compromise with a lot of people involved and I would like to pay tribute to the work of Ms Angelilli and her collaborators, the shadows, the coordinators and the Polish and Hungarian Presidencies. It is a compromise, and it is true that the Commission would have liked to go further in criminalising child sex tourism by including EU habitual residents as well as nationals in the extra-territorial jurisdiction against abusing children abroad. The compromise has considerably strengthened the proposal by criminalising child grooming more extensively and adding important provisions on victim protection, providing the right for employers to ask for information on criminal records and providing for awareness-raising and training of professionals as preventive measures. This directive equips us much better than the current one from 2004.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the prosecution of offenders there are 20 criminal offences, including new trends like grooming online, webcam abuse, web viewing child pornography; different levels of penalties from one year to ten years’ imprisonment; the elimination of hurdles that may be set by statutes of limitation or confidentiality rules and special police units specially equipped to identify child victims – which will be a very important investigative tool.</p>
      <p sl="en">On child tourism, there is extra-territorial jurisdiction for nationals; the removal of procedural hurdles and the prohibition of organising travel or advertising opportunities to abuse children. There is extensive assistance to protect the victims with an individual assessment of each child. There will be risk assessment for convicted offenders and intervention programmes as well as education, awareness training, etc. to detect child sexual abuse.</p>
      <p sl="en">On images of sexual abuse of children on the Internet, we have agreement on the removal of web pages hosted in Member States, intended action to have them removed abroad and the possibility of blocking, subject to transparent procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again, I would like to thank Parliament for your true commitment to this. It has been a difficult journey but I think we have skilfully navigated in this complicated file. With this we show that our collective aim is to protect children and we do not tolerate children being used as objects to satisfy the sexual needs or greed of adults. Thank you very much for your hard work in this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sexual abuse and sexual violence against children and young people as well as images of this are indeed among the worst possible crimes that anyone could commit against young people. Our highest priority must be to protect the victims, to prosecute the perpetrators and to punish them in a procedure that follows the rule of law. It is therefore good that, together, we have found a way to tackle this crime throughout the EU and to obtain a common basis for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Committee on Culture and Education, in addition to the issues of prevention, effective prosecution, information and more instruction in the use of media, one principle was particularly important to us and that was the principle of ‘deletion rather than blocking’. I am therefore pleased that, after a long struggle, we have succeeded in stipulating the deletion of websites depicting sexual violence against children and young people. The Commission proposed making it mandatory for all Member State to block these websites. However, it is no help to any child at all simply to draw a curtain, so to speak. Internet blocks are ineffective, imprecise, easy to circumvent and do not help to combat sexual abuse. In contrast, they create a censorship infrastructure, an instrument for controlling communication streams and are thus a threat to fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Germany, this has now been implemented. I very much hope that this example will also be followed in other Member States and that they will not use the option of blocking, as stated in the directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">I led on this report for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and believe our support of the Commissioner’s ‘three P’ approach – prevention, protection and prosecution – strengthens this report. Prevention is always the best form of protection. I am pleased that the report has included in it consideration of implementing an EU-wide telephone helpline.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the United Kingdom we have a successful helpline run by a charity called the Lucy Faithfull Foundation. The helpline offers support and counselling to prevent sexual abuse and protect children at risk. One of the most controversial challenges addressed in this report was the blocking and deletion of child pornography content online. I support the deletion of images and subsequent investigation by the police. Everything should be done to stop people accessing illegal images, including blocking.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to ensure a zero-tolerance approach to child pornography, and we need to take a child-centred approach. A society that protects the vulnerable, such as children, is one we must strive for.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, I would like to talk about the child exploitation directive. First of all, I would like to congratulate Roberta Angelilli for her invaluable work. I think we all agree that children are vulnerable persons; this is why they have needs that go beyond normal protection. In the last few years, a number of child abuse cases have been exposed on different levels, all over Europe and worldwide. While such cases are certainly shocking, they serve to make us aware of this problem and its extent. Nowadays, we are more aware of the considerable void that exists when it comes to providing greater protection for our children. Something needs to be done as soon as possible. Child abuse has probably been around since the dawn of time, but only now are we becoming aware of it. In the past, there was no Internet. Although the progress that came with it is undeniable, it has also brought about new ways with which children can be abused and exploited. On the Internet, potential abusers can get in touch with their unprotected victims, often using devious means. Moreover, the Internet allows the mass distribution of pornographic material. The directive on which we will be voting sends a clear message: abuse must end. The directive we will adopt defends children in the way they deserve. As a Member of the European Parliament I shall vote in favour. As the father of two children I am proud to do so.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I too welcome the Commission’s proposal for a directive and the report. Sexual abuse and maltreatment of children and young people via the use of new technologies is on the increase. Child pornography content available online – however short-lived it may be – is accessed by a great many people. An increasing number of primary school children are contactable via the Internet, mobile telephone or even directly.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In February 2011, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs demanded the removal from the Internet of online material containing child pornography and observed that concrete steps were needed to protect, help and support the young victims and develop educational programmes to help them when they become victims. We must actually ensure that victims’ fundamental rights are respected, and that they have access to legal remedies without being subjected to additional trauma as a result of participating in legal proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Every year many – nearly two hundred thousand – Russian and eastern European women and children find themselves forced into prostitution. There is no decline in the number of people in the most vulnerable groups; indeed, their number, too, is growing in tandem with the crisis and the rise in poverty. I drew attention to this on the website of the European Women’s Lobby, and in the present debate too I would like to emphasise that protection of children is our shared responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly I too would like to thank all those Members who have worked on drafting this fine text that is the directive being presented to us. I also welcome the firm political expression found in this text; it manages to balance things in such a way that we are able to protect children in Europe, by taking practical steps to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse they suffer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finding balanced solutions in a rapidly developing, technologically advanced world, a world that offers us wondrous things but that can also pose serious risks, even despicable risks at times, to everyone, especially to children, is a real achievement. Protecting children, either by removing child pornography websites at their source, if possible, or by blocking them, is one practical solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you have listed the measures that can be included among the priorities of our policy agenda regarding children in Europe, given that 10% to 20% of European children are victims of sexual abuse, and that, in the current crisis, which is set to last, 19 million children are exposed to the risk of poverty on our continent. I welcome these observations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You talked about the Hague Convention and, therefore, indirectly about legislation to facilitate the implementation of court decisions. I wish to draw your attention to the difficulties that bi-national couples experience with regard to the application of court orders pertaining to the custody of their children, particularly in relation to the Jugendamt issue in Germany.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in an era of rapid and apparently effortless global communications, particularly through the Internet but also now through mobile phones and iPads and the like, it is vital that we in the European Parliament work ever harder to protect children and young adults from the continuing threat of sexual and violent abuse.</p>
      <p sl="en">We as lawmakers have a responsibility to make laws and policies which protect and promote the interests of the most vulnerable in our society. Children, for instance, should not be viewed merely as small adults. They are not always capable of asking for help or even knowing when they have been wronged. It is therefore the adults in society who must take responsibility for these children and be their strong and robust advocates.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been working on this issue for many years, first as a minister in the UK Home Office involved in the UN Convention on Children’s Rights, the meeting in Stockholm in Sweden in 1996 and then as rapporteur on a previous European parliamentary report back in 2000 to combat child pornography on the Internet. I called for stronger preventive measures to tackle this menace and I asked Member States to work with each other and the law enforcement agencies and units such as Europol to make sure that illegal websites were closed down and perpetrators brought to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was a very similar backbone to Ms Angelilli’s report. It concerns me that, despite the legislative, financial and specialist input into this problem, millions of children across the EU are still at risk today. The violation of children’s rights must be stopped, so I am pleased that the ECR Group and my government in the UK are supportive of the aims and proposals of this directive, which goes even further than what I proposed in 2000.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am grateful for the work which Ms Angelilli and others from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Culture and Education have done in this area. I particularly welcome proposals to introduce a new offensive aiming to criminalise online grooming. I am also pleased this report advocates a more robust approach to criminal checks on professionals who want to work with children and encourages Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that children who report abuse from within their own family are protected.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to conclude my remarks by referring to the comments made by the British Prime Minister recently at an event in London last week which I attended. He reiterated that child trafficking and child exploitation were inexcusable and had to be stopped. Although this dossier finally does not deal specifically with child trafficking, I believe there is a political will at UK and EU level to continue our efforts to work on behalf of children and act as their advocates; they are our future, they are entitled to grow up free of these threats.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my group would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadows for the good cooperation in difficult negotiations. Whilst we certainly welcome the offence of online grooming being created, I must admit we found the attitude of Council in not wanting to incorporate grooming in all senses into this on the grounds that it already exists in national legislation a little surprising, given that many of the other offences here also exist in national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group, too, welcomes the inclusion for the first time in EU legislation of sex tourism related to children and the jurisdiction over nationals travelling for the purposes of child abuse, but we also agree with the Commission that it is a pity that we have not been able to find a solution on those enjoying habitual residence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also welcome the recognition of the need to deal with the associated advertising and facilitation of such travel. We, too, welcome the measures to deal with the exclusion of convicted offenders from employment involving direct and regular contact with children. We welcome the move to make it possible for employers to request information about the potential employees for professional or organised voluntary activities with children, according to national law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Article 25 relating to websites was particularly difficult to negotiate, as has already been said, and obviously the priority must be to protect children. However, there are legitimate concerns that measures employed for this crucial purpose become co-opted for other purposes of state control. The solution reached in this directive is important and has the full support of my group.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also welcome support for survivors knowing the tragic consequences that such abuse has for so many children throughout their lives. Finally, we welcome the recognition, too, of the difference for consensual sexual activity between young people, whom we do not want to criminalise for behaviour that may be foolish but which is certainly not exploitative.</p>

While I should like to offer my warmest thanks to the rapporteur for the long hours she has worked on this issue, I wish to underline three basic reasons why my group will be unable to support the report.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, because of its legal basis, the present directive adopts an overwhelmingly penal approach to the question of the sexual exploitation of children, which does not allow a suitable victim support and protection system to be developed.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, it puts a disproportionate emphasis on the ‘online’ aspect, despite the fact that, in most cases, this sort of crime is committed in the real world; the Internet is mainly a means of mass distribution of images of the crime.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, it introduces new provisions into European legislation to prevent access to certain websites, thereby creating a precedent which may prove to be inadequate in terms of future judgments in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, it goes without saying that we must protect the innocence of children, that we must provide them with sexual education at the right time, in keeping with the results of scientific research and, more importantly, that we must protect them from sexual violence that damages them emotionally and scars them for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p sl="el">By creating mentally stable individuals, we can, at the same time, create stable societies. Unfortunately, however, we witness violence in the education system, violence both in and out of school, and the sexual exploitation of young people at tender ages, even at home and at school.</p>
      <p sl="el">This very dangerous problem has taken on worrying proportions, as it is being promoted via various forms of online communications. This development makes finding those who promote child pornography a very difficult exercise; they are skilled in the use of misleading methods to guide children to pornographic websites.</p>
      <p sl="el">Particular emphasis needs to be placed on timely prevention and proper information for children, including about the direct and indirect traps that are being seen on websites at an increasing rate. The basic objective of the proposal for a directive on combating sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is to adopt European rules and provisions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this report into the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. In Northern Ireland, my constituency, recent figures show us that 18% of all children on the child protection register are in a category that includes sexual abuse. It is therefore vital that we enhance the protection of these children, especially in the face of new challenges posed by global communications which transcend national boundaries. With more children having access to the Internet and social networking sites, it has become easier for sex offenders to prey on their young victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the United Kingdom Internet service providers such as BT are active in helping to combat the issue of online child exploitation by voluntarily blocking inappropriate sites. Although this is a step in the right direction, it must be highlighted that many of these sites are hosted outside of Member States and cannot be taken down. I would like to see agreements in place that target such websites on a global scale. This is an area where Member States can, and must, act for the common good.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst we discuss the current threats facing children as a result of ever-evolving channels of communication, I would also like to remind this House of the many children, now adults, across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, who have been the victims of horrific historical, clerical and institutional child abuse stretching back many decades. Just last month an inquiry into historical institutional abuse was launched in Northern Ireland. For these victims of child sex abuse, their issues are as real today as when they first happened, and we must support them too.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I must commend the fact that children’s rights have become an integral part of the fundamental rights protected by the European Union following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, any European Union policy that directly or indirectly affects children must be devised, implemented and followed through in the best interests of the child, in accordance with the fundamental rights enshrined in this Charter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I should like to focus my speech on the special attention that the European Union should pay to children and their rights, in view of the increasingly rapid growth of new communication technologies. The latter can unfortunately be a way of facilitating encounters between paedophiles and their victims, but they can also act as a vehicle for disseminating child pornography content.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must respond to these two dangers in a strong and uncompromising manner. As far as the risks associated with children using the Internet are concerned, I believe that prevention should be at the heart of European policies. It is our duty to educate children about the online environment. To this end, the European Union must draw up a proper prevention policy that is suitable even for the very young, in order to inform children of the risks they run when they use the Internet. Internet usage must be safer and better adapted to children’s expectations and needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Alongside this prevention policy, the Member States must combat new forms of abuse and sexual exploitation such as online child grooming for sexual purposes, where adults, using their false profile information as a cover, take advantage of this situation to commit their crime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I wish to say a word about the fight against child pornography disseminated on the Internet. We have a duty to shut down sites with child pornography content, and we must make every effort to do so as quickly as possible. If, however, it took too long to shut down these sites, particularly in third countries, a temporary solution should of course be applied so as to block access to them, in the best interests, I repeat, of children who are victims of these atrocities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography sends out a clear message. This subject is an important one and one that concerns the whole of Europe, and uniform rules for the definition of offences and also for the penalties apply universally. Common arrangements for the prosecution of crimes committed outside the EU are still needed. The same applies to common standards for calling legal persons to account. The directive gives specific penalty options in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">One key area, however, was offences committed on the Internet. Here ‘grooming’ is now made punishable. It is also important that all Member States are obliged to take measures to get websites containing child pornography deleted. However, in addition to this there remains an important requirement for all institutions of the European Union, in their international cooperation with other states, to ensure that the principle of deletion should take precedence in other countries of the world, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">A great deal of abuse takes place in real life in our children’s immediate environment. Therefore, prevention mechanisms are particularly important, as is instruction in the use of media, so that, when using new media, our children and young people are able to recognise the sources of danger. Protection measures are obviously particularly important from the point of view of those affected, both for children during criminal proceedings and also in the form of special support for children and their families outside the context of such proceedings. The Member States have a particular duty here. Overall, after difficult negotiations, we have obtained a good directive. Following its adoption, it will be up to the Member States to implement it and put it into practice as quickly and as comprehensively as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">To finish I would like to make one more personal comment. Even though a different decision has now been taken, I would have liked there to be correlation tables for all directives in future. The fact that we will not now have this quick overview of the implementation of measures is something that I personally find very disappointing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the EU has a good story to tell about its work to protect children. Earlier this year in the strengthened law on trafficking, we included a requirement to appoint a guardian for unaccompanied child victims which hopefully will help to stop their disappearance from care back into the clutches of the trafficking gangs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new directive will mean child sex abusers and porn merchants would face a greater prospect of life behind bars. MEPs rightly fought for tougher sentences. It is also very important that we successively insisted on the ability to prosecute EU citizens who go abroad as sex tourists. I heard horror stories on this on a visit to Cambodia a few years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Among many other initiatives I would mention mutual recognition of disqualifications from working with children, cross-border exchange of criminal records – so that abusers can be tracked when they move – and particular protection of child victims and suspects in the criminal justice system.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would like to say a word about something Commissioner Malmström mentioned, which was the 116000 number for missing children. It is still not operational in, I think, 11 Member States, although that was required by last May. In addition there are problems with using mobile phones outside one’s home country because there is a dispute about who picks up the roaming charges. I would urge Commissioner Malmström to get to grips with this problem and talk to the mobile phone companies – in fact all the phone companies – and try and resolve this problem of the roaming charge because, until that is sorted out, we will not have a universal hotline for missing children.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, the sexual exploitation of children is a particular offence that leaves deep scars on children’s psyche. The legal frameworks of the Member States provide for certain penalties aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children, but we must improve our children’s level of security. The report by my colleague Roberta Angelilli is a step in the right direction. Legislation must therefore be changed so that criminals from the European Union are prosecuted, even if a sexual offence against a child was committed outside its borders. We must support organisations combating paedophilia. Support is also needed for citizens’ initiatives where the justice system is ineffective, corrupt or caught up in sex crimes involving child abuse. The paedophilia scandal that took place in Lithuania a few years ago is an example of this. High-ranking justice system officials were entangled in this case. The case only came to light thanks to an initiative organised by citizens, which prevented a cover up. It is also important to introduce simpler access to legal protection for children and parents who have become victims of sexual crimes. This is very important, particularly as far as the underprivileged are concerned because, as we know, this is the most vulnerable social group in terms of the sexual exploitation of children. Let us not forget that in this Parliament it is our duty to guarantee protection for children.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on combating child abuse that we are to vote on here is an important and positive step in the fight against the continuing exploitation of numerous children in the European Union and throughout the world. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are therefore extremely pleased that a workable agreement has been reached between the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">Particularly when it comes to such a sensitive and important matter as combating child abuse, it is essential to provide the correct political answers. I am therefore pleased that we have succeeded, after an in-depth debate, in agreeing on a clear commitment to the compulsory deletion of child pornographic content on the Internet, following the procedures of the rule of law. At the same time, it was right for us as Parliament to have persisted in our view that an obligation to block content on the Internet is not the right path to take. It definitely will not help victims of child abuse if we simply erect stop signs in the virtual realm that are easy to circumvent, while abuse and rape continue in the real world. For us it is not an option simply to push this distressful matter out of sight without taking the necessary steps to remove it. Both within the EU and its Member States and also in relation to third countries, this criminal and abusive material must be removed at source.</p>
      <p sl="de">Crime statistics show that most activity does not occur on island states somewhere in the Pacific, but here in Europe, in the US or, for example, in Russia. In view of our close cooperation with these countries, it cannot be asking too much to employ effective methods to prosecute child abuse.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we adopt this directive tomorrow, it will also signify a decision in terms of the direction that law enforcement on the Internet is to take. Instead of blocking infrastructures, which are highly questionable in terms of the rule of law, and arbitrary measures by the providers, we in the European Union want to create an effective framework to combat crime and abuse where is occurs. We do not want merely to sweep the problem under the carpet at the expense of judicial procedures, but to tackle it in an open way.</p>
      <p sl="de">A society must remain vigilant, particularly where abuse is concerned, and work to combat the causes of it outside of the traditional means of law enforcement, too. We now need to make some serious efforts in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Ms Angelilli for this initiative. Sexually exploiting children is without doubt one of the most degenerate crimes there is. Anyone paying or exploiting a young boy or girl for sexual purposes must be severely punished. Moreover, we need to take action against those who travel to other countries where it is easier to pay for sexual gratification from children, who often live in such poverty as to induce their families to sell them. Disseminating child pornography through the Internet must also be banned and the competent authority must be able to shut down the sites that put such material online.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no doubt that Internet users often come across sites containing pornographic material and it is hard to distinguish whether the people shown are under age or not. It would be good if there were campaigns designed to encourage those who stumble on suspected child pornography sites to flag them up to the competent authorities, perhaps providing a dedicated site where the suspected page could be downloaded. It will then be up to the competent judicial authorities to determine whether the reported site should be blocked or not. I am in favour of the report, since this problem should be dealt with seriously and carefully in order to protect children.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my constituency is suffering a hidden epidemic of sexual grooming so I appreciate the efforts of all those involved in producing this report. The grassroots campaigners for the protection of children tell me that the report misses the most important target. To concentrate on online pornography while relegating real-life child sexual abuse to a page 33 annex is to worry about a speck in one eye while ignoring a splintered plank in another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Real-life abuse is described in the report as ‘offline grooming’. Such terminology is an insult to the victims and their families. It is not offline: it is on our streets. It is not a matter of images: it is a matter of real-life degradation, gang rape, and even murder. But because a disproportionately large number of street groomers are Muslims, politically-correct censorship prevents the issue from being properly discussed. Because of this deliberate downplaying of the problem, on-street grooming is not even a specific offence in many countries. As a result, the crime remains statistically virtually invisible. This undermines attempts to secure justice for the victims, effective responses from the authorities, and proper penalties for the perpetrators.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my own constituency, the family of Charlene Downs still waits for justice following the botched prosecution of those arrested over the grooming, rape and murder of their little girl in 2003. Despite their belief that 60 other girls had been groomed by the same gang, and that Charlene’s body was disposed of in kebabs, the police regarded their report as too sensitive to publish. The consequences of such cowardice became clear four years later when 15-year-old Paige Chivers went missing, believed murdered, at the hands of the same gang.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, not all police officers are politically correct cowards, any more than all Muslims are groomers. The vast majority are as sickened by these things as we are, but the playing down of the problem in reports like this aids the criminal minority and leaves new victims at risk. The more serious crimes should get the attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am pleased that, with the report by Ms Angelilli, we have together succeeded in initiating a strong, effective directive, and I would like to thank Ms Angelilli for this. The directive represents a significant step forward in the fight against child abuse. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of crimes still take place within children’s immediate social environment. The perpetrators are to be found within their families, in their schools and among their acquaintances. In this regard, we are still at the start of our work to raise awareness. Therefore, our children need to be made strong – strong enough to have the courage to confide in someone close to them in an emergency, but also strong enough to recognise dangers such as grooming when using the Internet. Together, we must therefore ensure that a sense of responsibility plays a greater role when it comes to the use of media in the education of our children. In this regard, the provision of information is of major importance, as many teachers and parents do not know what it is possible to do with their children’s computers or mobile phones. There is a great deal of catching up to do in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore to be welcomed that this report also attaches a great deal of importance to prevention, as the authorities, but also schools and families, need to do everything they can to prevent these sorts of dreadful crimes from happening in the first place. As a result, the EU also needs better strategies for negotiating with third countries, such as the US and Russia. Websites hosted outside the EU can only be quickly and effectively deleted if we also cooperate closely with these countries in the hunt for the perpetrators and, together, send out a clear signal criminalising the sexual abuse of children. Up to now, once the perpetrator has been caught, the legislator has, unfortunately, often been surprisingly lenient and most of the penalties have been suspended sentences. The seriousness of the offence must be given greater consideration in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, however, it is important for the public debate to continue, as there are many different dimensions to this issue. Prevention, the protection of victims, technical development, the principle of deletion rather than blocking, case law, the provision of information and intensive scientific documentation of the facts must also continue to be pursued after the vote tomorrow. Under no circumstances can we just sit back and relax. Instead, we need to accept the call to action for us all – every one of us – and work to achieve prevention and the provision of information.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, today we are debating a very important report, into which the both the rapporteur and other colleagues have put a lot of effort, because the sexual exploitation of children is the most serious and cruel crime committed against children, in which the sexual abuse and physical and psychological suffering experienced traumatise children for the rest of their lives and have an irreversible impact on their personal development. Such crimes are also a dirty business that profits from exploiting children as sex objects, torturing and abusing them. It is therefore very important for this directive to make the penalties for such crimes more severe throughout the territory of the European Union because then individual Member States will be unable to give child abusers lighter sentences. We need to punish online grooming and sex tourism and it is also very important to strengthen victim protection. This directive sets great store by crime prevention such as education, training for officials working in this area and cooperation with relevant civil organisations. We must educate children and parents about the dangers lurking online. It is very important to provide victims and their families with psychological and other kinds of help.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to stress that, during an investigation, it is important for there to be cooperation between the police, non-governmental organisations and providers of social services so that child victims obtain the appropriate help and support. It is also very important to properly train specialists, teachers, psychologists, social workers and lawyers to participate in this work, particularly in the area of victim prevention and protection. Indeed I agree with my colleagues who spoke previously and who agree unanimously that all European Union Member States must be obliged to remove material placed on Internet servers throughout the entire territory of the European Union. This means that we can only achieve results by working together internally and with other European Union Member States, and by cooperating with third countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the sexual abuse of children is not only a crime, it is a disease, a market of disgrace and defilement that we need to bring to an end. We are gathered together here today in order to find the best way of doing that.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for their efforts to find a common position in this House. We have agreed on the principle of deletion rather than blocking of websites. We have agreed to implement the complete removal of child pornographic material from the Internet and to give the Member States the task of enforcing an access block if they do not achieve the removal of the material. However, we have also decided not to cover up what is going on, but to deal with the source and causes of this problem and to do so, above all, by means of this directive and the work that my colleagues have invested in it.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, however, this obviously forces us to act at international level. Mr Albrecht has just made this clear. Most of these websites originate outside Europe’s borders. It must not be the case that phishing sites are eradicated from the Internet quicker than child pornography sites. It is the job of all of us to remind states, whether European or otherwise, that they cannot escape their responsibility to take action here rather than to turn a blind eye.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to identify the people behind this, catch the people who profit from it and provide lasting protection for children in Europe and in other countries.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, tomorrow we will be taking a vote on a very important directive to combat the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. These violations must stop and I therefore support the proposal. I would call your attention to three points.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, cooperation. Criminal gangs which are involved in child pornography and sexual exploitation often work across borders. By working together, the police and judicial authorities will be able to map the whole chain of their evil activities. We need penalties which will apply to all aspects of their work. Obviously, international criminals will always mendaciously claim that they operate in relatively small gangs, in order to minimise their role, but we need to debunk that myth. After all, criminals are responsible for human trafficking, they are ruthless and work across borders.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, victim support. Last week, together with Mr Buşoi, my Romanian colleague, I organised a meeting on human trafficking and sexual exploitation, which was also attended by aid organisations from Western and Eastern Europe. They help women and children who are victims of sexual exploitation. They are doing this because various authorities responsible for this are failing to do much. In countries such as Hungary and Romania, women and children who are victims do not always receive proper support. However, Article 18 of the draft directive says that Member States ought to help underage victims. Several women’s shelters in Central and Eastern Europe are full of young girls, sometimes younger than 16. I call on the Eastern European Member States to heed the directive and take victim support seriously, and on the Commission to ensure that such support is, indeed, provided.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, prevention. There is very little mention of it in the directive and, so, we need to make a lot of improvements on that score. I support the rapporteur who has called on national authorities to do more work on prevention. My question to the Commission is: how are Member States going to report on their prevention programmes?</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, sexually abusing children is more shameful and debased than one can even imagine. Besides the crime itself, violent abuse of children has devastating consequences in terms of the victim’s development. It is no accident that many adults that commit abuse have themselves suffered trauma in their youth. It is therefore right to be as severe as possible in punishing this kind of crime, which often descends into the worst possible kind of horror when committed against vulnerable people, such as children with physical or mental disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to reflect in particular on one aspect of this report, namely the voluntary prevention and suppression measures for convicts. Chemical castration is certainly among the possible solutions we could adopt. This subject has not yet been broached in Italy, but it seems to have provided satisfactory results in various European countries where it is already in use. We must therefore proceed in this direction, even though I think that in the most serious cases it should be compulsory rather than voluntary.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, as a mother of four myself I am particularly pleased that we are at last taking action at European Union level against this most despicable type of crime, which is constantly selecting its victims and poses a threat to all our children, because it can reach into the places we believe are the safest, children’s bedrooms, via the realm of the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Credit is due to Commissioner Malmström for her initiative, and to the Hungarian Presidency for carrying forward negotiations on this important directive almost to completion by concluding the discussion on points of substance. I also congratulate the Polish Presidency on managing to put the dot on the i in a process that has lasted several years. My special thanks, however, go to my colleague Ms Angelilli for her excellent work and her perseverance. I can only hope that Member States will begin the process of transposing the directive into national legislation without delay.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We all know, however, that even the transposition of this directive into national law cannot eliminate child pornography completely. This is why there is room for all kinds of other initiatives targeting websites with illegal paedophile content and identifying the people or organisations behind them, those who support this sort of criminal activity either directly or indirectly, even just by providing server space.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I also want to stress again the need to raise awareness among children, families, and those involved in the care and education of children, regarding the dangers that can materialise from anywhere via modern technologies. I would like to emphasise that nothing can take the place of child care and protection within the family. We cannot afford to sit back; the fight must go on. One only has to think of how new technologies constantly change as they evolve. Child safety must remain a key issue in every EU Member State. We must continue to protect our children.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, sexual abuse, the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography represent serious violations of human rights, particularly the right of children to the protection and care essential for their happiness, as laid down by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. These crimes cause unimaginable long-term physical, psychological and social harm to their innocent victims. I would like to emphasise that the actual nature of these reprehensible crimes undermines confidence in the basic values of modern society in the area of the special protection of children, and, in a sense, also weakens confidence in the relevant state institutions and European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore firmly believe that serious crimes such as these require a comprehensive, common European approach, including the prosecution of offenders, as well as consistent protection of children. Above all, however, we need to make an effort and put all available resources into effective prevention of these serious crimes committed against minors. When implementing any strong measures to combat such abominations it is always vital under all circumstances to take account first and foremost of the interest of the child, in accordance with the previously mentioned conventions and documents, as well as generally-applied moral principles of society. When such a crime is detected, however, we should not shrink from publicly pillorying and condemning those that commit these crimes against children, whether they are private individuals or representatives of the Catholic Church.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I am very pleased at the fact that the European Parliament is giving its attention to this extremely important document about the fight against paedophilia and crimes perpetrated against the weakest and most defenceless. We should do everything possible to enable those very people – children – to feel much safer here in Europe. For it is the world of the Internet, a world associated with permissiveness and the popularisation of a liberal approach to sexual activity, which sometimes goes so far that it means causing harm to an innocent child. Therefore I greatly welcome the fact that the directive induces individual Member States to adopt much more rigorous measures which impose suitably severe criminal sanctions on these crimes. Yes, such crimes should attract suitably severe punishment and should be prosecuted with the appropriate degree of consistency. It is also extremely important to react to this kind of problem, too, when it appears in the Internet. Therefore it is very important and appropriate to see that these points have also been noted in an applicable directive.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should straight away like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Ms Angelilli, for her excellent work. Achieving a balance on an important directive that we obviously completely support was no easy task.</p>
      <p sl="it">The debate on such a sensitive subject can be seen as fruitful. There is no more deviant crime than crime against young people and children, given their defencelessness, fragility and vulnerability. In particular, sexual crimes should always be punished decisively and severely. The parts of the text on child pornography, on the possibility of blocking these sites or deleting them if they cannot be blocked are important, as are the references to subjects such as trafficking in human beings, which is often in the hands of organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must also strengthen relationships with local bodies, Ms Malmström, because as we know, after the reception centres these children move to family homes and then often disappear without a trace. I approve of individual rehabilitation processes that follow an interdisciplinary approach, as someone said not long ago, to strengthen a sense of well-being that must, of course, be rekindled in these children. The early warning system is also a good thing: it will be important to share it among a greater number of Member States, just as it is now important to underline the need for increasingly strong cooperation based on trust among Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reference to seizures is also important. Let us confiscate assets from people convicted of this type of crime and use them for good in these areas, nurturing these children back to mental, physical and social well-being. This directive is an important and necessary step, but Parliament still needs to come up with many more.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, child abuse is a nightmare for any parent and an indescribably traumatic experience for the child and for society as a whole. Nobody, not even institutions, can be allowed to get away with child abuse or be above the law.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have reports of horrific things coming to light in several EU countries. In the Netherlands, we witnessed a terrible and widespread abuse case. A whole network of abusers was rounded up. A man born in Latvia, who had already been convicted in Germany, was allowed to work in a crèche in Amsterdam, just like that, without the staff being made aware of his previous conviction. He used the Internet to spread pictures of his abuse of extremely young children.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Employers, as well as organisations working with volunteers, ought to be made aware of any previous convictions. A certificate of good conduct, which is necessary for these kinds of occupations, will be linked to the European criminal register, which will be put into operation in 2012. I am very pleased that this proposal of mine has been adopted by both Parliament and the Council. We will tackle cross-border abuse, such as sex tourism. Nationals of Member States who abuse children in other countries will be punished.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, we need to protect our children online, because every click, every glance at a photograph or a film of an abused child constitutes the repeated degradation of this child. Approaching children online for sexual purposes will be made punishable. Victims need protection and very thorough aftercare, including during criminal proceedings. The adoption of this improved legislation will help us create a safer Europe for our children.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, child abuse material has been rapidly increasing in prevalence on the Internet and the severity of such content is worsening. Indeed the statistics reveal a truly harrowing story. In the UK, for example, BT Internet alone estimates that their blocking technology prevents 40 000 attempts to access known child abuse websites every single day. That is over 14 million attempts every year.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I am pleased to see the Commission’s proposal for a directive on combating this issue. Sadly there is one aspect which, as well as causing significant controversy, provoked an emotionally charged debate; this of course was the issue of blocking versus deletion. No-one is suggesting that blocking is 100% effective. However blocking is a quick and crucial short-term disruption tactic. Quite simply, it is my belief that the protection of our children and the apprehension of the criminals who perpetrate these abuses should take precedence over freedom of the Internet and the human rights of those sick individuals who view this material. I am sure that the majority of European citizens will share this belief.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sad truth is that, whilst action on the online sphere is valuable, the best way to prevent child abuse images circulating on the Internet is to stop child abuse – full stop!

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I fully support the proposal for a directive; it is a real breakthrough. Furthermore, Ms Angelilli’s commitment to the cause of child protection is one of the most noble objectives that a parliamentarian can undertake.</p>
      <p sl="es">Children are weak and vulnerable and therefore deserve the highest level of protection. Sexual abuse of children must be prevented with new legislative measures and punished harshly under criminal law. So-called sex tourism and child pornography are forms of exploitation which should be a matter of priority for law enforcement, including international agreements on the matter. In my opinion, all agreements with third countries on free trade and development aid must include a child protection clause.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must also focus our serious concerns on the child indoctrination that occurs in some countries suffering structural poverty, where they hand over many children, the offspring of polygamous unions, to apparently religious schools to avoid lack of food and hunger. Child assassins, child soldiers and child drug runners are among the most heinous forms of exploitation, a widespread phenomenon on two continents which has irreversible social repercussions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Programmes to rescue child victims of forced prostitution must be a political and social priority of the European Union. Line 11600 must have the commitment and unwavering support of all Member States.</p>

Despite the lack of statistics, studies illustrate that, in the European Union, between 10% and 20% of minors have suffered sexual violence. The offenders are usually people in their close social environment. These days, with the quantum leaps being made in new technologies, mobile telephony and the Internet, there has been a parallel eruption of child pornography and sexual exploitation websites, with ever younger children falling victim to skillful paedophiles.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to give my full support today to this report, which allows for significant progress to be made in the protection of children’s rights. It stresses the need for more prevention and introduces harsher penalties. In this regard, I would like to highlight the importance of tougher sentences for those who have taken advantage of their position of authority, confidence or influence to abuse a child.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also insists on follow-up measures for victims and their families. I mention their families deliberately, because they are also victims. Admittedly, they are indirect victims, but they can be deeply affected by the sexual violence that their child has suffered.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Aside from certain differences that have surfaced during the negotiations, we were keen to ensure that the best interests of the child were our main concern at all times, and I believe it is important to highlight that today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I must admit that there is something that has left a bitter taste in my mouth. This does not directly relate to Ms Angelilli’s report; it is a more general issue. Commissioner, why is the Commission refusing to declare itself in favour of the Union’s accession to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child? Like other Members, I submitted a written question on this matter. Why, when the Union now has a legal personality that allows it to ratify international treaties, can it not go further in recognising children’s rights? The argument that the Union is not competent to intervene in this area does not satisfy me. This legalistic answer is not valid. Ratification by the Union is a strong political message that we have a duty to send. If the Union undertakes to enforce children’s rights, then it must ratify the Convention, especially since we now have the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including Article 24 thereof, which obliges us to enforce these rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must be bolder and prove that it is equal to its new responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is never appropriate to rank crimes in order: they are all, clearly, despicable. However, the crimes we are talking about this evening are especially contemptible. Perhaps it is not by chance that one of the harshest pages of the Gospel is the one where Jesus says: ‘Whoso shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.’ Rarely are the words of Christ more damning.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some days, you go home pleased at having done a good job: today is one of those days. Thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Angelilli, and to the other European institutions, the Commission and the Council, we are launching an important piece of legislation that includes: measures against sex tourism; a clear definition of the crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation, and of child pornography, as well as the aggravating circumstances; a guarantee of as much free psychological help for victims as each case requires; a decision on the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of these crimes; a focus on prevention; and much else besides.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even these days, when anti-politics seems to have the upper hand, politics is able to provide a clear and tangible response, in the first instance for the benefit of the many associations and volunteers who deal with these issues on a daily basis and for the police forces that carry out a highly sensitive and extremely valuable job which, in some countries including my own – Italy – has reached standards of genuine excellence and constitute examples to be followed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today the important thing was to produce a European strategy to make our citizens feel that the Union is there for them, especially on such crucial issues as these. We can be quite secure and proud in saying that we have succeeded in doing so.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I welcome Ms Angelilli’s initiative to raise this subject again for discussion. I have noticed my colleague’s constant concern for sensitive issues affecting children, like this one, and I want to congratulate her for this. I wanted to take the floor in this debate because, unfortunately, in the recent EU Kids Online study, my country features in the increased risk group. The study was carried out with the backing of the European Commission and concerns the amount of time children spend on the Internet unsupervised. Children in Romania, who exceed the average European time of 88 minutes per day, are therefore much more exposed to abuse from cyberspace.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that cooperation between Member States needs to be strengthened, especially in terms of implementing the legal framework. Cooperation between the police and agencies involved in protecting and educating children is important in order to prevent such behaviour. Child pornography is one of the most common offences committed online, in addition to cases involving the transfer of personal information, cyberbullying and fraud.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The general public could play a role in preventing this by simply reporting incidents of this kind. For example, in Romania, FOCUS – the Centre for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children is extremely active. Set up in 2007, it is involved in campaigns to raise public awareness and prevent this problem. At the same time, it runs an emergency number for reporting cases of child pornography and is cofinanced by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I call on Member States to step up their cooperation with third countries to combat this problem globally.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament, working together with the Commission, is flexing its muscles in the interests of the children of Europe. Ms Angelilli’s report, which is the result of exemplary cross-group cooperation, is our strongest weapon to date against the abuse of minors, which, as we know, has reached such dimensions, throughout both Europe and the world at large, that no single Member State can hope to achieve something in this area by acting alone. Child welfare must be given priority in our political work. This is the proof. Building on this excellent report and the forthcoming directive, we must set our sights on the next steps, intervening before such horrific acts occur, in other words we must strengthen preventive measures. I refer particularly to the way in which children are portrayed in the media: here we find children presented as sex objects and depicted in suggestive and lascivious poses. This is precisely what happened recently in French magazine ‘Vogue’. An issue that was distributed throughout Europe showed 10-year-old girls in provocative poses – something the experts tell us provides a clear stimulus for criminality among paedophiles.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to take action both on the Internet and beyond. In future, we need to raise the clearly declining threshold of acceptance, after all anything that impinges on our children requires maximum protection. We need to put a stop to the perversion of the principle of the freedom of the press, which is a red herring anyway, before children are abused. The media should not be allowed to provide an impetus for those with paedophile tendencies, who can interpret such publicity as a prompt for action.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this in mind, I would encourage the Commission and Parliament to continue with this joint campaign.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Ms Angelilli for her outstanding work. Her perseverance and knowledge have produced a clear text that lays the foundations for increased child protection, thanks to unambiguous and relevant definitions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This text recognises that every abuse situation is different and proposes a framework appropriate for each case. No form of violence is overlooked, and the vulnerability of children is fully taken on board.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report takes full account of the Internet and its associated risks. One can only applaud this large-scale harmonisation, which allows for significant progress to be made in the prevention of child abuse and in the just conviction of abusers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was high time that the European institutions got a grip on this issue and clearly showed that the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children, no matter what form they take, are unacceptable. In that respect, Ms Malmström also deserves to be thanked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must protect our children, who are often faced with abominations that they do not comprehend. Much progress is being made. The report fills a harmful void by taking into account sex tourism, even when it takes place outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that many Member States will restrict access to child pornography, either by removing sites or by blocking the web pages concerned quickly and effectively. Our children need the best possible protection in their living environment, whatever their social background.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I think children’s rights should be looked at from a broader perspective. Despite the fact that 90 million children live in the European Union, they are still treated more as the object of law than the subject of law. In all Member States, children are protected by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and many national regulations, but their protection, both in the real world and in cyberspace, is not sufficient. Measures for their legal protection are not sufficiently coordinated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Often in various countries there is talk of insufficient support for education, health care or social care. However, there is no institution which coordinates and monitors work on behalf of children. Furthermore, not all the Member States have a child protection service which would be the first point of contact for children when they are being abused. The system of foster care is not sufficiently well developed and functional in all Member States. Extending this system needs the right effort to be made, and this includes funding, and it also requires specialist support for foster families.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As for the rights of children with disabilities, a system should be established for the early support of children with disabilities. Education for doctors and medical personnel should be introduced in the field of work on behalf of children and their parents and the help which can be given them. Without doubt one difficulty in doing these things is the fact that a European fund still has not been established which is aimed specifically at solving problems involving children. Therefore, Ms Malmström, I appeal for consideration to be given to the possibility of establishing such a fund. I think the European Union should be playing a key role in protecting children’s rights by introducing additional regulations and strengthening cooperation between the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the sexual abuse and exploitation of children is becoming notably widespread in the Member States of the European Union. This worrying fact is facilitated by the use of new technologies, especially the Internet. Children of both sexes are affected by these attacks, although the majority of reports relate to crimes against young girls.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think the European Union needs to set itself up with a legislative framework that can condemn these despicable acts and harmonise the criminal laws of the Member States. Recognising phenomena such as grooming, introducing a definition of sex tourism, creating telephone helplines sponsored by the Union, and blocking and removing images from websites to avoid abused children being repeatedly victimised are all measures that are on the right track to help combat this situation, which we must deal with firmly and decisively. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Ms Angelilli.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I think it is essential to support the development of facilities to provide assistance to victims, as well as roads to rehabilitation for offenders. The role of women needs to be put back at the heart of this process, since women are the main carers in families and in society, including by toughening up the legislation in force in Member States and harmonising punishments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, a crime is a crime, regardless of whether it is committed physically or on the Net. Criminal gangs commit organised crimes, regardless of the means they use. Kids deserve our full protection and deserve to feel protected. That is why I have been so committed to this work. They have the right to live in freedom and security, and they also have the right to integrity on the Net. I am glad that we have finally been able to agree on adopting common, legislative, concrete measures to truly combat child abuse – as is called for, by the way, in the Stockholm Programme. There is strong support to enhance prevention, protection and prosecution, and to protect the victim throughout the European Union. Child pornography images, grooming and sex tourism are finally criminalised.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully embrace freedom of expression and freedom on the Internet, but that is not the issue now. What we are voting on is the protection of innocent children from brutality on the Internet, not on limiting the Net. It is not about blocking the Internet, it is about blocking images that are illegal on the Internet. It is not about ideology or censorship, it is about violence and exploitation that can traumatise children for the rest of their lives. With this directive I believe we will succeed in strengthening the means to combat child abuse without creating a Big Brother society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States will have to remove pornographic content on a webpage hosted in their territory or block such content if the server is in a third country and removal is not possible. But the directive also provides for transparent procedures and adequate safeguards. We should, of course, also engage in dialogue with the industry and service providers to make the best use of information technology, and I also call on the IT industry to continue to play its role and be responsible.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this directive and in the European Union Programme for Children we are finally putting children at the centre of European policy and creating a culture of zero tolerance. I would just like to finish with a call to nominate, in every committee in Parliament, an MEP responsible for children’s rights so that we can really unite forces and stand up for children in all our work.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, according to UNICEF data, the child pornography industry continues to flourish, unfortunately, and about 1 million children are abused and exploited for this contemptible purpose. Child pornography and the sexual abuse and exploitation of children are a gross violation of the basic rights of a child enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, it is the duty of lawmakers at EU and Member State level to adopt concrete legislation to prevent this particularly serious crime from being committed.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The duty to protect children, who are the most vulnerable members of society, surely requires solving the problem through the toughest legal measures of criminal law. The serious nature of the act therefore justifies the adoption of sweeping criminal penalties and measures, including custodial sentences, which should be differentiated according to their level of seriousness, in order to achieve the necessary deterrent effect.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The nature and method of committing these crimes is mutating considerably in the anonymous environment of the Internet, which often encourages crime, and laws must take account of this and respond sufficiently flexibly, leaving no loopholes. The supranational and even global nature of this crime allows the perpetrators to avoid penalties outside the EU, and international cooperation is therefore essential, in my opinion. I therefore support the idea of the Commission initiating a discussion aimed at achieving an internationally binding agreement.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would first like to thank Ms Angelilli and also the Commissioner for their effective cooperation in producing this directive. Child pornography does not exist in reality. It is only the crime of sexually abusing children in the creation of a visual recording that exists. It is only the production of photographs and video recordings of particularly serious crimes that exists. If we bear this fact in mind, it is clear that blocking Internet pages that have this content is not an adequate response. Our priority must be to protect the human dignity of children. This will be ensured by removing such content from servers. Blocking access to specific sites should be used only in situations where harmful content cannot be immediately deleted.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would also like to mention another aspect. We should take every means to involve parents in the fight against child abuse and sexual exploitation, particularly in relation to the Internet. Imagine the number of mothers and fathers waiting for help from psychologists, teachers, sociologists, doctors, police officers, criminologists and judges. This is because their children are in difficult situations and the parents look for an excuse in the fact that they were ignorant of the threat to their children. I would like to ask the Commissioner: What is the European Commission doing to encourage parental responsibility? What, according to the Commission, is the role of parents when it comes to respecting and protecting the rights of the child? Perhaps I have overlooked this aspect in the documents of the Commission. Parents figure there usually and almost exclusively as those who fail to fulfil their obligations to children, or commit violence against them.</p>

In future, the European Union as a whole is to have mandatory minimum sentencing for child abuse, child prostitution, child pornography and child sex tourism. Internet providers and travel agents, who indirectly profit from these shameful acts, can expect stringent penalties. Child sex tourism will be subject to criminal prosecution in all Member States, even if the crime itself was committed outside the European Union. For me it is also important that Member States should be obliged to shut down child pornography sites and to block access to foreign sites.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the need to adapt our child protection policies to effectively tackle the realities of the 21st century is undeniable.

      <p sl="en">It has been said of this policy that it is unproven and that it potentially undermines freedom of information and communication on the Internet.

It has gone on for years but it has only recently come into the public domain and perhaps no place more than my own country, where reports have highlighted the abuse of children by clergy and members of religious orders. As a result certain actions have been taken to protect children and to deal with the offenders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, I am pleased to say that the government is introducing a referendum to the constitution to further guarantee the rights of the child. It is good that we are discussing this here today, because we can give it a broader dimension, particularly in terms of bringing legislation onto a European-wide basis which can guarantee the rights of children and protect them in the future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the sexual abuse of children has an increasing number of dimensions. It is an alarming trend. The possible consequences are appalling for the abused children and for society as a whole. One of the current manifestations of child sexual abuse is the dissemination of child pornography on the Internet. Unfortunately, current legislation is not enough to fight this problem effectively. We must therefore look for a solution that will limit the dissemination of child pornography and the abuse of children as much as possible. There is talk of identifying and blocking websites, and of stricter punishments for those who commit these offences. The objection that this might lead to a restriction on freedom of information is irrelevant, in my opinion. There is often an international dimension to this type of criminality. The lack of mechanisms for enforcing the law in this area must therefore be counterbalanced with tougher penalties at European level, and greater coherence between the legal systems of EU Member States.</p>

The Internet is the main arena nowadays for child pornography.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It also needs to be noted that children and young people are in the most vulnerable situation.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, children’s rights are enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by all 27 Member States. The fact that children’s rights exist is one thing, but their implementation is quite another. It is essential that these rights should be monitored. According to a survey conducted in 2009, only about 22% of children are aware of the existence of children’s rights. This is an untenable situation because children need protection. The Commission must establish clear framework conditions that are as simple as possible. These framework conditions must support and protect parents, who have custody of their children and who are therefore responsible for them, in observing and exercising their parental duties.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to say thank you very much to all who took part for a most interesting and very important debate. I would like to highlight a few things, because much has been said.</p>
      <p sl="en">Baroness Ludford asked me about the countries that have not acceded to the hotline number 116000. In the revised Universal Service Directive it says that the Member States should have made every effort to accede to this by 25 May of this year, and still 11 countries have not done so. It also says that the Member States shall inform citizens that it exists and facilitate the operation of services in order to comply with this. It is up to the Member States to choose how they promote the hotline. In order to raise awareness, allow exchanges of best practices and identify practical tools, the Commission is organising best practices meetings and high-level meetings with stakeholders and will continue to do so every year until all countries have made sure that it is operational.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also had a question from Ms Nedelcheva on the Convention of the Rights of the Child. It is more complicated than it might seem to adhere to this, because the European Union can – as the Members well know – only act within the limits of the competence conferred on it by the Treaties. Moreover, in accordance with the articles in the actual Convention of the Rights of the Child, the instrument is open only to state parties. For these reasons the Commission does not, therefore, envisage acceding to the Convention. However, the EU agenda for the rights of the child reaffirms the importance of the Convention and will do everything to make sure that all EU legislation and proposals are in line with that Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to highlight something that might be a misunderstanding; I do not wish to open the debate again but want to assure you that nobody has promoted, proposed or envisaged introducing blocking instead of deletion; that has never been an issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we should do – and this is very clear in the Commission proposal, and I am very happy to have the huge support in this House – is ensure that Member States delete at source. This is the only way to combat child pornography on line. We shall delete at source. However, we all know that with the majority of these horrible sites – and I do not know if you have seen them (there are toddlers on these sites) – there are a lot of people making huge amounts of money every time someone sees those babies being abused, and every time someone looks at it they are abused again, again and again.</p>
      <p sl="en">The majority of these sites are not hosted in the European Union: that is why the Commission proposes that the Member States should block access to the content until it can be removed at source. In this proposal it says that Member States may now do so. Of course, we must also cooperate with the countries which host the majority of these sites, and we are engaged in very active negotiations, talks and collaboration with, for instance, the United States on this – they are moving forward – and also with Russia and other states.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said this, I think you, Ms Angelilli, with the massive support and praise you have got in this plenary from the Left to the Right, can be very proud of what you have achieved. We can all be proud: the Council, the Commission, Parliament and yourself, because with this we are providing good tools to prevent, to protect and to prosecute people who commit these offences. We are also sending the very important political signal that sexual abuse of children like this is not acceptable, and this is a clear message from the whole of the European Union. Thank you very much for a very important debate and very important work.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Ms Malmström, I am pleased by the unanimity which prevails in the Chamber on the need to fight sex crimes committed against children. We can say today that the route to the formal adoption of this instrument at first reading stands wide open before us. I am also sure that the compromise which has been agreed, thanks in great measure to the efforts of the rapporteur, will allow the rapid adoption of this directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have listened with interest to all of the speakers here in this debate. Each one showed enormous interest in the needs of children, who are a very special kind of victim. The situation demands that we react as new developments arise. We must respond to threats as they appear, particularly because very many of them are related to the development of modern technology such as the Internet. Therefore, with this directive we are bringing in measures which make a radical contribution to strengthening the protection of persons under the age of 18 years by creating new offences, which include a number of crimes associated with the use of modern technologies. As the European Union we do not want to lag behind international organisations and we must not allow this to happen. May this resolution be a very plain, clear and unequivocal signal to the European Union’s citizens that we are treating the work of protecting children as very important and as a priority. In this case it is a signal which is all the more important because it is on us – on adults – that there rests here a particular responsibility to remember the children – those who themselves are not able to protect their own interests.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like once again to thank very sincerely everyone who has been involved in this work, and in closing to express the conviction and the hope that the instrument – the proposal for a directive which we have discussed today – will not become a paper tiger or just a law on paper, but will be a real instrument for improving the legal protection of children and for prosecuting crimes perpetrated against them.</p>

I also think it is important to say to adults, parents and teachers that we need to fill the generational technology gap that often keeps adults far removed from social networks and the Internet, and therefore far removed from a world that is very familiar to children.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to clarify something with regard to the Internet and, in general terms, the virtual world: there must be no fears that removing child pornography could be tantamount to censorship, limiting freedom of expression or information, or even that it could represent a criminalisation of the Internet and new forms of communication. Quite the contrary. The Internet is a huge asset and offers an enormous opportunity for communication and socialising: our goal and the goal pursued by the directive is simply to tackle the abuse, violence and exploitation that could, unfortunately, be fostered on the Internet through photos, images or films. Therefore, only items related to these extremely serious crimes will be subject to removal, so there will be absolutely no censorship or limitation on the freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should also like to spare a mention for Ms Sippel, whom I thank once again for her input on this task. I too am perhaps a little disappointed that the text does not contain concordance tables. We initially included them in the recitals and therefore within the body of the directive. As we know, negotiations have been tortuous and very difficult, but in my opinion we should in any case be happy and satisfied with the outcome.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by stating my agreement with something that Ms Malmström mentioned: perhaps something more could be done on the issue of sex tourism. True, something more could be done, even though the directive gives Member States that want to do more the possibility to take action.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, we can say that this is a rigorous, exhaustive and groundbreaking text. I am very pleased with it as, I think, are my fellow Members. I should like to thank once again the shadow rapporteurs and all the Members who contributed to the positive outcome of this text, as well as Ms Malmström and of course the Council, the Hungarian Presidency, and above all the Polish Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="nl">With the agreement that we are going to seal tomorrow, we will be better able to protect our children against all forms of sexual abuse, including that which takes place on the Internet. The punishment for violations will be substantially increased and there will be a lot more attention on the protection of victims of child abuse. Online grooming (befriending children for the purposes of sexual abuse) and child sex tourism will become illegal in all Member States, both on EU territory and abroad when EU citizens are involved. As regards child pornography on the Internet, not only will the possession of child pornography be made punishable, but also visiting child pornography websites. Parliament has ensured that Member States are now required to remove child pornography from the Internet and thus to allocate all their resources to detecting their source. After all, it is not sufficient to block access to websites and leave tackling the problem at that. In addition, the website blocking technology is not perfect and the risk of blocking more websites than is necessary is very real. It is therefore good that we are requiring Member States to ensure that there is transparency about website blocking and that there are sufficient safeguards to prevent collateral damage.</p>

      <p sl="it">Sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, are serious violations of fundamental rights, in particular the rights of the child to such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, as stipulated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The directive we are shortly to adopt is the first measure looking at a specific area of criminal law: the protection of children against sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and child pornography. Having spent years fighting actively against paedophilia, I can only welcome this new directive, which works on three fronts: preventing the crimes, harsher criminal sanctions for offenders and greater protection for victims. Furthermore, the directive introduces innovative measures designed to combat all kinds of abuse: it introduces the crime of grooming, defines the crime of sex tourism within the Union, brings in restrictions to avoid offences being repeated and provides for the seizure and confiscation of assets deriving from the crime of child pornography. Lastly, I think that giving Member States the power to take the necessary measures to ensure the immediate deletion of web pages containing or disseminating child pornography is a significant step forward in the fight against abuse</p>

      <p sl="pt">International law sets high standards for the protection of children, yet its implementation at national level often falls short of its objective of ensuring that they are adequately protected. National legislation makes up for some of these problems, to varying degrees, but it is not sufficiently rigorous or consistent to provide a vigorous social and criminal law response. The new directive should ensure that there is a comprehensive legal framework covering the following aspects: repression in terms of the effective, proportionate and prohibitive punishment of sexual abuse and exploitation of children by introducing stiffer penalties and new kinds of criminal offence; increased protection for victims through adequate and ongoing assistance, always with a view to the child’s best interests; and prevention through prohibitive measures, reduced demand and measures to reduce the risk of children becoming victims. Adequate and effective research techniques and instruments are also necessary, as are initiatives to raise awareness and provide education, along with the creation of help lines or emergency hotlines. However, it is imperative that the policy objectives set out by the Commission in the EU strategy on the rights of the child also be translated as quickly as possible into concrete action.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Statistics show that from 10% to 20% of children in Europe fall prey to sexual molestation in their childhood. It is an alarming fact that the scale of sexual violence among children is continually on the increase. Also growing is the number of Internet pages featuring child pornography. To tackle sexual molestation and child pornography it is necessary to have not only the commitment of social activists and politicians, but also the cooperation of parents, teachers and school psychologists. Also needed is improved cooperation in organising effective social campaigns which aim to make society aware that pornography is not a minor problem but a real threat to society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Personally, I think the EU’s response to the phenomena of child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children must be sharp and decisive. I hope it will be possible to establish a transnational cooperation programme which will enable the tracing, location and punishment of people who exploit children and the removal of Internet portals which engage in the distribution of pornographic materials involving the participation of children.</p>

      <p sl="en">The status of children has been the focus of international attention for a number of years, most notably in the drawing up of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Children are also increasingly affected by a whole range of EU policies and legislation. The Commission has made an effort to define a so-called ‘EU agenda on the rights of the child’. However, its communication focuses mainly on legal dimensions, which – although of major importance in their own right – do not take proper account of the critical importance of appropriate socio-economic policies for children. We may not achieve the target of curbing the level of poverty by helping 20 million persons improve their standard of life by 2020, if we do not have a strategic approach on children and children-related components. We should develop and implement an EU Strategy to halve child-poverty by 2020, and break the spiral of poverty in general. We consider necessary to mainstream individual children’s rights in all EU policies, monitoring and evaluating the steps undertaken to end child poverty, identifying and developing priority actions, aiming to enhance data collection and to further develop common indicators at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As the Commission pointed out, it is estimated that between 10% and 20% of children in Europe will suffer sexual abuse during their childhood. Those macabre figures are enough to make you shiver, and if nothing is done to curb this sad phenomenon, the situation will inexorably worsen, affecting ever younger children, with ever more violence. The Council and Parliament have agreed to harmonise and strengthen the preventive and coercive measures to combat sexual abuse and child pornography. Child grooming, sex tourism – including outside Europe – and the production and use of child pornography material will be more severely punished where EU nationals are involved. The text on which we are voting today provides the Member States with effective weapons to combat this phenomenon. I refer in particular to the possibility of blocking websites with child pornography content, and so not stopping at procedures for removing the site, which can be lengthy and unreliable when the site is hosted abroad. It is estimated that 80% of sexual abuse is committed by people with authority over the child or who are in the child’s close family circle. Let us not add the shortcomings of an ill-adapted legal framework to the rule of silence already hanging over the victims.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The scale of the sexual exploitation of children is very large and affects all the Member States. Research conducted in Poland by the Nobody’s Children Foundation has shown that 9% of girls and 6% of boys have had sexual contact with an adult before reaching the age of 15.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I call upon all countries which still have not done so to ratify the Lanzarote Convention – the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. I appeal in particular to the Polish Presidency to set a good example and ratify the convention without delay. Combating sex crimes requires preventative measures. Public information campaigns are needed for children and parents. It is necessary to initiate Union-funded educational programmes in schools. Children have to be aware of what kinds of situation and behaviour are dangerous, and they have to know where to report such incidents. Only by working in this way can we reduce the scale of the sexual exploitation of children. The Member States should be providing regular training for officials who may come into contact with children who have been the victims of sexual exploitation. Such officials have to know how to identify crime, and they have to have the ability and the skills necessary to intervene. The Member States should also be giving support to child victims and their families. International cooperation on the prosecution of crimes, the protection of child victims and preventative measures requires urgent adaptation to the needs of the hour.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Victims of sexual abuse can come from any socio-cultural background, any Member State and any social level. Therefore, it is important for us to join forces to find an effective method of tackling the problem of the increased incidence of crime involving the sexual abuse of children.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States approach this issue in different ways. However, thanks to the development of state-of-the-art communication media with a cross-border influence, I think that we need a joint strategy for improving global cooperation, not only between authorities in the EU, but also between police agencies and Internet operators. On the other hand, as the sexual abuse of children is very often the result of the interaction between the personality of the perpetrator and the social context that he or she is in, apart from focusing attention on the children who are victims of sexual abuse, it is important to focus increased attention as well on finding suitable measures for decreasing the chances of the perpetrators of this abuse reoffending, in other words, measures leading to their rehabilitation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Protecting the young and innocent of the world is a fundamentally sound human rights choice. Thus, the European Union has continued its efforts to extend its influence worldwide and address the issue of child pornography. Children are without a doubt the future leaders and require the protection of global institutions. Therefore, the legislation being implemented by the EU is determined in its endeavour to protect all children. The European Union has instituted (in brief) the following legislation: sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, constitute serious violations of fundamental rights, in particular the rights of the child to protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, as stipulated by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This legislation cannot and will not be taken lightly and represents the protection of the young and innocent citizens of our Union. I strongly support this legislation and stand behind the EU’s decision to further protect the future and innocence of these children as they continue to grow and develop in the fabric of the Christian values of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection and the content of the protection granted (recast) (COM(2009)0551 – C7-0250/2009 – 2009/0164(COD)) (A7-0271/2011).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadows on this report, the staff members from the three institutions – not least my own office – the Presidencies concerned and the Commission for their interest, effort and commitment over the time we have been negotiating the revision of this directive. I would also like to thank the experts who have supported us.</p>
      <p sl="en">This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. At EU level, it is this directive which sets out the standards for qualification for international protection: for those classic refugees who have a well-founded fear of persecution – such as many of those who dared to oppose Colonel Gadaffi and thus qualified for refugee status; and for those at risk of serious harm – perhaps a teenage girl facing the death penalty in Iran for having sexual intercourse outside marriage, who could then perhaps qualify for subsidiary protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">As well as setting out such criteria, the directive deals with the content of such protection, such as access to healthcare or education. The revision of the directive is limited; it is a recast. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs would like to have dealt with such issues as ‘actors of protection’, where the majority of us believe this should only be the state. That is why we have cited Article 7 as one we think should be looked at in the next review, as should the definition of ‘family members’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wish to put on record my own concern at the lack of change in Article 10(1)(d), where the cumulative definition of a social group was maintained by the Commission rather than being offered as an alternative. I trust, at least, that the ten Member States operating in the optional perspective will continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, some progress has been made. The definition of a social group which could suffer persecution must now include due consideration of gender-related aspects. We have also included a reference to legal tradition and customs in Recital 30. We also include sexual orientation and, for the first time, gender identity. We should not expect people to deny their identity throughout their lifetime in the hope that this will make them safe from persecution.</p>
      <p sl="en">As concerns children – the topic of the last debate – Recital 18 lays down some principles, though not an exhaustive list, to help in determining the best interests of the child. This principle is also linked to entitlement to benefits. In Article 31 we have sought to improve the tracing of family for unaccompanied minors, across the asylum process.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the content of protection, we have tried to ensure the same treatment for all beneficiaries of international protection and have achieved this in many areas, notably in terms of recognition of qualifications and access to employment. People want to contribute to the country that is providing protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, a few Member States have insisted on being able to maintain certain differences between the two groups. This seems to be based on the misapprehension that those at risk of serious harm will need protection for a shorter period of time than those at risk of serious persecution. Our fight – maybe I should say our debate – over the length of residence permits yielded a small victory. However, we would invite the Member States most concerned in relation to difference of treatment to reflect as to whether an annual consideration of status is a good use of public money, and whether it reduces administrative burdens or provides a better context for integration than a period of at least three years. After all, there is a possibility of using cessation provisions if a need for protection changes.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, this revised directive takes small, but important, steps towards a common European asylum policy, but the system is only as common as the consistent high quality of its implementation across all participating Member States. We hope that movement on this directive will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like, first of all, very briefly to thank Parliament for its constructive cooperation in working out a compromise over correlation tables, which has also made possible adoption of the agreed text of the qualification directive. This is the first legal act of the second phase in the creation of the common European asylum system, and in our opinion its adoption is of enormous significance for establishing a good atmosphere in further work on the asylum package.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like here to express my very sincere thanks to Ms Lambert, the rapporteur for the directive, for the huge amount of hard work she has put into the document. Finally, I would like to pledge that the Polish Presidency will do everything possible to facilitate the negotiations on the remaining acts of the asylum package. We want to move work forward on these documents as far as possible and help our partners in the Trio so that there will not be any problems with achieving our common objective of completing work on the asylum system by the end of 2012.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I begin by thanking the House and, particularly, Ms Lambert. I know you have done a huge job, together with your group, in the informal asylum package working group to achieve this. Thank you for your commitment and your relentless efforts to bring this file to a conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The qualification directive is, of course, a key component of the asylum system. It represents a major step towards achieving higher standards of protection and a more level playing field, and it also provides greater efficiency and coherence. By voting for this tomorrow, this House will send a very strong signal that the European Parliament is committed to moving forward and achieving a good result for the whole asylum package.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am going to Luxembourg tonight, together with the Polish Presidency, and will be able to convey that message to the Council of Ministers of the Interior tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">The compromise on the table is balanced, and I think it meets many of our concerns. We welcome, in particular, the criteria for qualification, notably the notions of ‘actors of protection’ and ‘internal protection’. The compromise also addresses the common objective of ensuring the strengthening of gender-related provisions. It fully respects European case law and addresses adequately the issues of potential misuse and adequate standards of protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission would have liked to go further as regards the definition of family members, but we regard this as a step forward. The definition extends to parents or other adults responsible for unmarried minors who are beneficiaries of protection. We also welcome the strengthening of the obligation to take into account the best interests of the child, as well as the progress achieved on the approximation of the rights granted to refugees, and to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, in respect of access to employment and to healthcare. It will ensure a higher level of legal certainty for beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, and will facilitate their integration into society.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards social welfare and residence permits, I regret that the compromise retains the possibility of differentiating between refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. We share that regret. Nevertheless, the deal on residence permits is a step forward because it will be possible to renew it for longer periods, if protection is still needed, than under the present rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The approximation of rights granted to beneficiaries of protection contributes to the streamlining of administrative procedures and will lead to a reduction in costs and the administrative burden of managing different protection strategies. This is clear from the positive experience of the Member States which already operate in this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">A final agreement on the qualification directive would be a very positive sign symbolically, politically and legally. As you said, Ms Lambert, in a few weeks’ time it will be the 60th anniversary of the relevant Geneva Convention. It is a positive sign that we are committed to achieving the common European asylum system by 2012; I know that this is also the goal of the Polish Presidency and the incoming troika.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the achievement, and the vote tomorrow, will provide new momentum for the negotiations on the rest of the package. It will not be easy, but we are moving slowly but steadily forward. You can, as always, count on the Commission to do our utmost to facilitate and be helpful in this very important work, which is possibly the most important package of this legislative term for all of us in this field.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I congratulate Ms Lambert and the shadow rapporteurs on the impetus given to this report, without which there would have been no agreement with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">How to go about deciding who qualifies as a family member was a key factor for my group. This needs to be defined properly to prevent abuse of the Community system for international protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">The distinction between beneficiaries of asylum and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection is essential when agreeing on who has what rights. Subsidiary protection is more limited in time than asylum, the former status providing entitlement to a shorter residence permit (one year) and the latter to a longer residence permit (three years), although both cases can be reviewed if the threat to the beneficiaries remains.</p>
      <p sl="es">The plan to remove the distinction between the two forms of protection was originally rejected by my group and by the Council, which is why we must now congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="es">The need to recognise the rights that legitimately belong to those that are persecuted is consistent with measures to prevent fraudulent use of the European system for international protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must also welcome the fact that the report sets out the need for Member States and their authorities to safeguard the best interests of minors and to extend protection to unaccompanied minors, paying particular attention to their safety, well-being and development, as well as the principle of family unity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, Mr President, the inclusion of references to persecution by customs or traditions, resulting in genital mutilation, forced abortion or forced sterilisation is a remarkable and outstanding achievement.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament sees the Commission proposal to recast the original directive from 2004 as part of the move towards a common European asylum policy by 2012. In the case of the original directive, the European Parliament had only an advisory role. Now, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is in a position of codecision.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The existing directive includes two key elements. The first is the grounds on which someone qualifies for refugee status or subsidiary protection, and the second is the content of that protection in terms of residence, employment and social rights within the Member State responsible for protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A fundamental change proposed here is to approximate these two categories much more closely. The main objective is, on the one hand, to ensure that Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection. On the other hand, the directive should ensure that a minimum level of benefits is available for these persons in all Member States. In order to enhance the effective exercise of the rights and benefits laid down in the directive by beneficiaries of international protection, it is necessary to take into account their specific needs and the particular integration challenges they are confronted with. Efforts should also be made to address problems relating to financial constraints. This restricts the access of these persons to educational opportunities and employment-related training, thereby reducing their chances of becoming an integral part of our democratic society. In conclusion, Commissioner, I would like to wish you success and to urge you to ignore the cries of the various demagogues who are against the asylum policy already, and possibly against the immigration policy as well. We will be keeping our fingers crossed for you.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, ever since 1999, the EU Member States have been talking about establishing a common European asylum system. The commitment to have this in place by 2012 has been made time and again. I regret the fact that, despite this, several of the asylum reports are stuck in the Council and the process is going extremely slowly. I welcome the fact that the Polish Presidency has now breathed new life into the negotiations and I hope that its good example will be followed by the forthcoming Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is very good that Parliament is now voting through the first of the asylum reports, concerning the Qualification Directive. I would like to say a big and heartfelt thank you to the rapporteur, Ms Lambert, who has done an impressive job on this report. It is my hope that the adoption of this directive will provide the necessary boost to the remaining negotiations on the reports that are still outstanding, for example on the Dublin II Regulation, for which I am rapporteur. I have high expectations of both the Polish and the Danish Presidencies.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There remains solidarity with those who flee and are forced to make their way to Europe and solidarity between our Member States when it comes to taking responsibility for those refugees who reach our continent. Solidarity is a linchpin and a platform on which we must build our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and our rapporteur Nadja Hirsch (who is unfortunately not well today) welcome the fact that a compromise has been reached between the institutions concerning the correlation tables. Parliament would like to include such a reference in order to oblige the Member States to demonstrate the implementation of all EU directives in their national systems. Even though we would like to establish clearer requirements for Member States to use these tables, we welcome the compromise that has been reached.</p>

It is very significant that, after our hard work, we are taking a big step forward by adopting this first directive. I would urge all of those involved to continue to work towards compromises so that we can keep to the timetable we have set ourselves and deliver a common system by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With that, I would like to thank Ms Lambert once again for her splendid work and wish all of us luck with the enormous amount of work that still remains to be done.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Ms Malmström, Mr Stachańczyk, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group finds several significant and important things in the directive. For example, the emphasis given to the fact that it is the Member States which are responsible for the conduct of asylum policy, which means they should have the power to introduce or maintain more favourable provisions than the standards laid down in the directive. We see this as something which is reasonable and which should be stressed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another thing we think is significant and worthy of emphasis is the question of maintaining the principle of family unity. However, the ECR Group will abstain from voting on this directive, because we have certain doubts concerning the extension of the definition of family members and the fairly narrow grounds for refusing to grant refugee status. Our group is of the opinion that on questions of asylum and immigration, cooperation between the Member States and the European Union should be subject to coordination rather than compulsion. This is why we are going to abstain.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, allow me, first of all, to thank Ms Lambert and congratulate her on taking this huge step, because we could say that Parliament has finally got its act together. We have confirmed here, once again, that we stand for a common asylum and migration policy throughout Europe and that we are, indeed, responsible for ensuring that that gets off the ground. Promises have been made; we have made a promise to each other that, in 2012, we will come up with a joint policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am a little worried, however, that we might get stuck again in the Justice and Home Affairs Council next week. The European Parliament knows what it is doing, but I fear that the Member States will end up having a stand-up fight in the street over this. I am getting signs of this from the proposals currently tabled by Member States, which are designed to limit the amount of change effected in Dublin and to ultimately thwart an eventual solidarity clause, where countries which receive small numbers of refugees are required to help out countries which receive a lot of refugees.</p>
      <p sl="nl">No, we are looking into new short-term measures, into statistics, into how FRONTEX can be applied even more harshly to protect borders. Nobody is looking into how we might ensure that the European Union is a place where you can feel safe, where you can take refuge, and a place where you definitely know your reception will be coordinated.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What we have here is the Qualification Directive, which, in any case, draws a line as to who may be considered to be a refugee. We now have to wait for the Council’s response and for future directives in order to find out what assistance refugees can count on and how we can ensure that they are able to quickly build a new life in our community.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to warmly congratulate Ms Jean Lambert on the results she has achieved. She has proved to be a star rapporteur. She has succeeded in including gender identity as specific grounds for persecution. That is extremely important for all transgender people, who are, unfortunately, often persecuted around the world simply because of what they are. The protection of children is now better regulated, as well, especially with regard to the tracing of parents of unaccompanied minors. It is unfortunate that, in the field of social security, we have not succeeded in establishing a uniform system for refugees and other people in need of internal protection, but we have, at least, made some progress here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, my group will abstain from the vote tomorrow. We fear that the adoption of the Qualification Directive might be the beginning of a customised approach and that, ultimately, we will fail to reach agreement on the reception and procedure standards and that, as Ms Sargentini has said, we will only go part of the way in dealing with the other issues.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I know that Ms Jean Lambert is aware of this and of which issues we are hesitant about, although she, herself, has come to a different conclusion. I hope that she will be proved right and we wrong, and that the adoption of this directive will not take anything away from the nature of the asylum proposals as a package. It is therefore of great importance that both Commissioner Malmström and the Polish Presidency confirm that, for them, this principle is still set in stone. I wish Commissioner Malmström every success in keeping this package as a unit.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to take my turn in congratulating Ms Lambert, who has done an excellent job on one of the most serious problems facing Europe today.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I am very sceptical as to the efficacy of what we are debating. Reality is more tragic. My country, Greece, as the Commissioner knows full well, has become the main entry point for immigrants, especially from Arab Spring countries and, as a result, there has been a huge influx of immigrants into Greece.</p>
      <p sl="el">Turkey is unable to guard its borders in terms of people leaving and it is impossible to guard the Greek borders to stop them coming in. These two facts are creating an explosive situation and, as a result, hundreds and thousands of immigrants are congregating in Greece and their presence is starting, I would say, to no longer befit a civilised state.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner Malmström, we need to revise the Dublin Regulation; because of the way in which it works, on the one hand, the poor refugees are being sent back to Greece and, on the other hand, the East keeps cramming them into Greece and, as a result, they are ‘stacking up’ in Greece. You need to find ways of helping now, so that, as decent human beings, we can cope with emerging needs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we should be under no illusion during the present discussions. For example, one should bear in mind that the European practice of focusing on child welfare when it comes to asylum petitions, drives many under-aged children from the developing world into the arms of people traffickers and thus into dangerous situations of dependency.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe that we should broaden the interpretation of the term ‘family’. If handled too loosely, this would result in a tidal wave of family members seeking to join those who have already successfully obtained asylum, reinforcing a form of illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are already countless hoards of people throughout Europe who have crossed our borders illegally and who have no entitlement to asylum under the Geneva Convention. Their hope is that they will be legalised some time and huge numbers of lawyers in so-called asylum organisations are slowing down the hopeless cases. In Austria alone, 15% of all asylum cases have a positive outcome for the applicant. Clearly, some shady dealing then goes on at the expense of the other 85%. We should prevent this at all costs.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, in a statement made 61 years ago, EU founding father Robert Schuman said that, with increased resources, Europe could – as he said then – fulfil one of its essential tasks, namely the development of the African continent.</p>
      <p sl="el">I mention this particular statement because today, unfortunately, we have not fulfilled this historic obligation either towards Africa or towards other less developed countries plagued by constant outbreaks of violence and conflict, which is where the refugees come from.</p>
      <p sl="el">The UN High Commissioner for Refugees noted in his most recent report that there had been a 17% increase in the number of asylum applications in the developed countries in the second half of this year alone. Therefore, Europe has a big responsibility and specific resources are needed, as Robert Schuman said at the time, so that we can respond to these needs. We need specific political instruments at our disposal for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="el">The agreement in principle with the Council on the directive we are debating today, to safeguard minimum requirements for the recognition of beneficiaries of international protection is, of course, a balanced, positive and encouraging directive and, as such, the rapporteur certainly deserves congratulations for her supreme efforts. I too would remind the House, as Mr Díaz de Mera said earlier, that our group did not vote in favour of the report in the first stage in committee; now, however, we too are in the fortunate position of being able to vote in favour of it.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, from now on, if we are to be able to bring about the desired results, if we are to be able to provide protection to our fellow men and to implement the vision of the founding fathers of the Union, we need high-level application, as we heard earlier, solidarity, fair burden-sharing and an integrated asylum package, which we trust will be ready by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is the only way we shall be able to respond to real needs; that is the only way – I repeat, with solidarity and burden-sharing – that we shall be able to deal with the serious problems which my country, Greece, as Ms Tzavela said earlier, is currently facing.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, we have wanted to move forward with the approval of the asylum package for a long time, and the ‘Arab Spring’ and the wave of migration triggered by it have made this all the more urgent. The appropriate response would have been to speed up approval of the asylum package, but instead we responded badly, by restoring temporary border controls and restricting freedom of movement. Europe also scored poorly as regards solidarity. In the light of this, the report before us is particularly important.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We know that the debates on the draft report, both within Parliament and among the European institutions, have been difficult. If we are able to approve the eligibility criteria for international protection, this will be a major step forward for common European policy on asylum and migration, and it will help us to adhere to our values and principles, to protect those who would be subjected to persecution in their home country, and to safeguard the rights of those who seek our help as refugees.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Part of this protection involves fostering social integration through an integrated approach to issues concerning the treatment of aliens, education, social welfare, and employment. The directive provides a good basis for this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that a step – a major step – has been taken towards the creation of a common asylum system in the European Union, and like my fellow Members, I hope that the adoption of this report will give a definite boost to the negotiations on the other topics of the asylum package that are still being held up.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Like most of my colleagues, I hope that Cecilia Malmström will summon a great deal of courage – something that she does not lack – in order to make progress with this set of measures, and at the same time I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to our rapporteur for the huge amount of work she has done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I said, a whole series of advances have been made. I shall emphasise just three of them. The first is the merging of the two types of status, that of refugee and that of beneficiary of subsidiary protection, even though I regret that some disparities still remain, especially regarding residence permits and access to social protection, but this harmonisation will come in due course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second notable advance – and all afternoon we have debated rights and child protection in other reports – is the very positive provisions concerning children, including the rights of unaccompanied minors and in particular the granting of international protection, since these minors are clearly often in a very vulnerable situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I am also pleased that the inclusion of gender identity and sexual orientation as grounds for persecution is a key element of the text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the face of world movements, of migratory flows, implementing the right to asylum is more urgent than ever. That is why we need a common European right to asylum as soon as possible, because the interests of these people, of asylum seekers, of stateless people, are at stake, of course, but, above all, so are the interests of the Member States. It is important to point this out at a time when we are seeing, in all the topics we are dealing with, withdrawal and selfishness, particularly in relation to those States at the external borders of the European Union, who are under immense pressure, as our Greek fellow Member has just explained so well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in order to summarise my point, allow me to quote, at this late hour, the philosopher Kant: ‘The right of a foreigner [is] not to be treated with hostility because he has arrived on the land of another.’</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we welcome the report by Ms Lambert, not only because it improves the treatment both of beneficiaries of political asylum status and of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status, but mainly because it includes identical and equitable treatment of them in all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Furthermore, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status have more substantive privileges under the present report; over and above the humanitarian aspect of this issue, this will dissuade some of them from taking recourse to the political asylum procedure, even though they perhaps know that they have no right to political asylum.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I consider that it is very important to add that the Member States too should adopt a way of relieving the pressure on the southern states at the receiving end of immigration flows, namely Malta, Italy, Greece and Cyprus, by allowing these people to enter from one Member State to another, under specific circumstances, in the ultimate objective of facilitating social integration.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, it would be better, of course, if the Commission tabled the entire asylum package at once, because, apart from the delays, its approval in fits and starts is giving rise to doubts as to the intention of applying the requirements for political asylum seekers.</p>

We will all need it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Like others before me, I also wish to raise two points among those that I believe are of particular interest and are a step in the right direction, concerning the outcome of this directive. They are the definition of family members, of course, which now includes the parents of married minors, and also the introduction of the notions of gender identity and sexual orientation as recognised grounds for persecution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my view, the various advances made in this text are important for the remaining negotiations on the asylum package, if we are to ensure that the text of the package is truly consistent, as it deserves to be. We should in fact use these elements of the Qualification Directive as valid precedents for the directives on procedures and on reception conditions, and even for the Dublin II Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I know that this approach is not necessarily shared by some Member States within the Council. In truth, however, what are our objectives? Do we wish to establish common standards, or do we want to carry on juxtaposing national systems, the shortcomings and inequalities of which we see every day, and which serve only to perpetuate a system of asylum lottery? Do we wish to carry on seeing Court rulings for failure to respect international conventions and not do anything about it? The answer is most certainly ‘No’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our aim is to complete the common asylum system in 2012. This does not mean that we should settle for the lowest common denominator. We should not move forward just for the sake of it. Furthermore, the cost argument, which is still regularly heard during our discussions, is not a valid one, even in these times of budgetary cuts. Cost rationalisation, as is sometimes practised by certain Member States, is nothing but a short-term approach that will not succeed in solving the structural problems of the European asylum system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At present, there is a tendency to mistrust and reject those who enter European territory. To combat this mistrust, clear and shared rules must be laid down. This is what the reform of the asylum package is all about. Concluding it in accordance with harmonised standards would evidently be to the Union’s credit.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur. The problems caused by the recent migration flows from the southern Mediterranean were wrongly perceived as some internal weaknesses inherent in the Schengen area. In actual fact, they demonstrate, first and foremost, that the European Union has a problem with the external management of emigration in general and with the asylum system in particular. I believe that once we resolve the problems arising from the refugee management system, the pressures at the Schengen area’s internal borders will also disappear, as the secondary movements of asylum seekers will be curbed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The reform of the Qualification Directive for international protection is of paramount importance. However, we need to bear in mind that the whole asylum package has to be adopted as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The element which needs to be radically improved is solidarity between Member States with regard to refugee management. Unfortunately, however, we sadly note that it is precisely this solidarity that the EU has been lacking of late. Right-wing and far-right governments need to abandon their populist and xenophobic attitudes which they have shown recently, not only towards immigrants, but towards some European citizens as well. This directive will not have any real impact as long as some governments continue to promote nationalist policies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that it is time for the European Union to prove that it can revive the spirit of solidarity for the benefit of both its own citizens and those who need its protection.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the proposed changes to the directive on international protection aim to reduce current differences in the way that the status of refugees is recognised in individual EU Member States. The different national policies and perceptions of EU policies in the Member States, as well as the different experience of national institutions with the adaptation and integration of asylum seekers in their countries, have lead the Member States to try and implement the current Directive in the way they consider best, according to their own experience. I therefore understand how it was necessary to complete as many as six informal trialogues when preparing the submitted document. The Commission’s attempt to interfere in the tried and tested procedures of national institutions under the pretext of greater unification of the asylum system may understandably provoke disagreement, particularly from experienced officials, since certain concepts are defined in a way that is fundamentally different to the definitions formerly in use.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, the updating of the directive should proceed in a pragmatic and sensitive way, paying full regard to the views of the experienced national institutions that will be implementing our asylum policy on the ground. Only thus will we succeed in our task.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I should stress that it is assumed that there is no effective protection available if the state or agents of the state are carrying out the persecution. At the same time, it is vital to establish a causal link among the reasons based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion and persecution. With regard to social assistance, the beneficiaries of this system must have access to a minimum set of rights, which are the same as those granted to citizens in the host state.

I am convinced that this Qualification Directive represents a major step forwards. I believe that it is particularly important that we have succeeded in producing a narrow definition of the term family, thus preventing abuse. In the context of subsidiary protection, I consider it a good thing that internal security is to be prioritised, namely when the prospect of effective protection exists in part of the country of origin. I also believe it significant that, in order to speed up procedures, reasons should be agreed for when subsidiary protection will be provided and when not. Thus, for example, it is made clear that subsidiary protection is not to be afforded if the asylum seeker is guilty of a serious crime.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today someone who is seeking protection in the European Union can be subject to quite a cruel lottery because conditions vary a lot between the Member States. They vary in terms of the procedures, the administration, the rights he or she has, the length of the procedures, whether he or she is considered to be entitled to protection or not, and what he or she can do in the meantime while waiting for the authorities to make a decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is of course not acceptable, because we are all in the same European Union with the same values and standards and laws, and we have all signed up to international conventions such as the Geneva Convention. It is not only us here who think that this is not an acceptable situation. Member States and their heads of states have in their absolute wisdom realised this. That is why they have called for us to set in place, by 2012, a common European asylum system, so that we will have harmonised systems so that every person is treated more or less in the same way. We have heard all about a common European asylum system before, but this time it is really time to put it into action. 2012 is tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need a system with high standards, with harmonised procedures, we need these to be transparent and predictable, and we need special provisions for the most vulnerable. We need quick procedures. If a person can stay he or she can then quickly move into his new society and integrate. If he or she cannot stay, then he or she will have to be sent back under dignified conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, 10 countries of the European Union receive 90% of the asylum seekers. That means that 17 countries could do more if the administration and systems were there. Then we would more equally share the responsibility and we would also be able to give more protection to those who are really in need.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is important, and that is why the vote tomorrow and the report that we are discussing today is so important.

It is true that we have difficulties with our asylum system; we know that the results can be very different from country to country, and we are also aware that this one step forward is not going to solve all the problems – although we know that it will give greater clarity in certain areas and hopefully provide a stronger base for Member States to build on the good practice which exists in some and to share that with the others.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have heard a number of regrets. Well, we all have a few but, then again, maybe not too few to mention on this occasion. Certainly in terms of the correlation tables: yes, we would like to have seen those. We would have liked to see Member States being very clear about their implementation but, on the other hand, what I think we are more interested at this point is actually moving forward in terms of the content and the common asylum system.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it says a lot that the rapporteurs from the other asylum dossiers have all been present tonight at this debate, and many have spoken. The willingness of Parliament to move forward is extremely clear, because this is a team effort. I thank people for their warm words, but this is a team effort and involves compromise and solidarity amongst us in Parliament to try and move things in Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we have heard, we hope that the movement on this directive – and I hope that groups will be voting in favour of it tomorrow (and maybe one or two groups might like to reconsider their abstentions) – will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible, and that quality and consistency build confidence among the Member States and the public and deliver sound humanitarian protection for those in need. I think that is what we need to have at the front of our minds when we are looking at this asylum package.</p>

      <p sl="el">I should like to congratulate Ms Lambert on an important job extremely well done. The review of the original Directive 2004/83/EC forms part of the procedure to achieve a common policy on asylum by 2012. In her proposal, the rapporteur shows due respect for national legislation, gender equality and the protection of minors and calls for protection based on enhanced criteria. We need to be especially careful when it comes to defining who is entitled to subsidiary protection and who enjoys special protection. We need to ensure that these rights are not abused. Burden-sharing in immigration is a necessity. Immigration is a difficult issue to resolve; however, we can manage it if we take the right action. In light, in particular, of developments in North Africa and the Arab world, we must find a European strategy to address the problem of immigration, so as not to leave the Member States to their fate and, at the same time, to ensure that the unfortunate people forced to migrate and the citizens of Europe bearing the burden are not taken advantage of. We need to demonstrate solidarity to refugees as well as between Member States. I trust that the adoption of this directive will help us to move forward, towards a review of Dublin II, which I believe is a necessity.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Sophia in 't Veld on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name records (PNR) data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (09825/2011 – C7-0304/2011 – 2011/0126(NLE)) (A7-0364/2011).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by saying how satisfied I am with the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. Parliament last year set out very clear criteria for the transfer of PNR data to third countries. The Commission then put forward a very good package in line with those criteria, and the Council very swiftly adopted a negotiating mandate. I think this example demonstrates that, if the three institutions work together, Europe is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Axel Voss, Birgit Sippel, Timothy Kirkhope, Jan Albrecht, Rui Tavares and, more recently, Cornelia Ernst. Even if we do not agree on every single detail I think the PNR team has worked in a very constructive spirit.</p>
      <p sl="en">As rapporteur, I recommend in my draft report that this House gives its consent to the conclusion of an agreement with Australia on the transfer of PNR data. I think the recommendation will get wide support, and I am very happy with that.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, that does not mean that all concerns and reservations have been met. There are still some doubts and hesitations. For this reason, some groups in this House will withhold their vote or vote against. I fully understand their objections, and I share most of their concerns. However, they know as well as I do that a ‘no’ vote will not stop the transfer of data. We are not voting on the actual transfer, we can only vote on the conditions governing the transfer of data. A ‘no’ vote, therefore, is purely symbolic. For that reason, I will also not endorse the GUE Group’s call for a consultation of the European Court of Justice, although I have great sympathy for that proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have assessed the draft agreement against the criteria that we set out last year and given a positive assessment on a number of points, in particular the limitation of the ‘purpose’ definition. It has been considerably tightened, and includes only the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime. I think that is a very important achievement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also ensured that the method of transfer will be ‘push’ exclusively. That is very important, also in view of future agreements. There are also some other positive points.</p>
      <p sl="en">However there are also a couple of remaining concerns, as I said initially. The most fundamental point is that the necessity and proportionality of the mass collection and storage of data has been demonstrated only partially, and not sufficiently. Secondly, no justification has been given for the long-term storage of identifiable data of all travellers. The retention period of five and a half years appears to be fairly random, and was not based on any specific evidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the appropriate legal basis for the agreement should be – or in any case include – Article 16 of the Treaties, on data protection. If you retrace the history of these agreements back to 2003, the purpose of this agreement has been, from the very start, exclusively to ensure that the transfer of data to third countries is in line with EU data protection standards. Therefore, the only proper legal base can be Article 16 and nothing else. If the purpose were exclusively police and justice cooperation, the EU could theoretically decide against the collection of PNR data by Australia. But it cannot, because it is a sovereign and unilateral decision by Australia to collect these data.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we need a political assurance by the Commission that the agreement remains the joint responsibility of the three EU institutions, each with its own role. If, in future, the European Parliament notes serious deficiencies in the application of the agreement, we expect the Commission to respond and to take appropriate action including, if necessary, the submission of proposals for the suspension or termination of the agreement. I would like to ask the Presidency of this House to see to it that these assurances, as expressed today and noted in the minutes, are confirmed by an exchange of letters with the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have indeed travelled a long way on this. It was in May last year that we started to discuss the renegotiations of the PNR agreement with Australia and the USA. Considerable efforts and contacts and a good cooperation, including with our Australian counterparts, have been taking place during this time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today we have a proposed agreement that you will be voting on tomorrow. I think we can agree that we have worked hard on this. We have an agreement with very high standards which very much reflects the position taken by Parliament in its resolution and the mandate given by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">From the Commission side, we consider that this is a further improvement of the 2008 agreement. It has clearer language, such as the definition of terrorism and serious transnational crime, it is a further strengthening of police cooperation, with high standards of data protection and it ensures freedom and safety for international air travel.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also recognises that information sharing is a fundamental component of the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime. In this context, the use of PNR data is an essential tool but it recognises that such information sharing has to be undertaken in full respect of fundamental rights and freedoms. The data are transferred to the Australia customs service for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences or serious transnational crime. In exceptional cases, PNR data may be processed for the prosecution of the vital interest of any individual, such as risk of death, serious injury or threat to health.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Australian customs services will ensure that the relevant analytical information obtained from PNR is available to police and judicial authorities of Member States or Europol or Eurojust as part of EU-Australian security cooperation. The data is retained for five and a half years. After three years the data elements which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR data relate will be masked out. Such depersonalised data will only be accessible to a very limited number of customs services officials. The data will, as the rapporteur said, be transferred to the Australian customs service on the basis of the ‘push’ method only.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement applies without discrimination between passengers and prohibits all processing of sensitive data. It lays down provisions regulating rights of access, rectification, erasure and redress for any individual concerned. It prohibits decisions with adverse legal effects being taken exclusively on the basis of automatic processing of PNR data.</p>
      <p sl="en">All data processing is subject to oversight by the Australian Information Commissioner, who has effective powers to investigate and monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement. All data processing is logged or documented for the purposes of oversight and auditing by the Australian Information Commission. Data may be shared with other government authorities of Australia only on a case-by-case basis and only for the purposes of the agreement. Onward transfer of data to authorities of third countries is allowed, subject to the same data protection safeguards as those applicable to transfers of data by air carriers to Australian customs services under the agreement, only for the purposes set out in the agreement and only on a case-by-case basis. The competent authorities of the Member States are also consulted when data concerning an EU citizen have been transferred to a country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement will be reviewed one year after its entry into force. As regards suspension, in general suspension of agreements is regulated, as you know, by Article 289 of the Treaty. Under that procedure, the Council takes a decision on suspension on a proposal from the Commission, but a parliamentary resolution calling for a suspension signals serious problems with the current agreement and would certainly be a very important element in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the House, and especially the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, for their very important cooperation. I think we can be proud of the result.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I recommended Parliament to consent to signing the new text of the Agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name record data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The re-negotiated draft agreement contains safeguards on the transfer and processing of passenger name record data, including: the right of passengers to access their own data, the right to have it corrected and the right of passengers to resort to judicial redress or sanctions in the case of any breach of data security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This proposal will enhance the effectiveness of the measures for combating terrorism and cross-border organised crime and promote international cooperation ensuring citizens’ safety. Passengers’ rights will, in any case, be better protected with this agreement than without it. I want to thank Sophia in ‘t Veld and the PNR team for their work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am pleased that the first of three agreements is finally to be signed and sealed. Naturally I would like to see this helping to speed up our negotiations with Canada and the US, however I also hope that the agreement will become a kind of template for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">When faced with issues like this, we generally always look for the right balance and ways to prevent criminal activity while, on the other hand, seeking to secure the fundamental rights of the individual and to provide legal certainty without restricting everyday functionality. However, this also means recognising that fast, effective exchange of information and data is now essential in order to guarantee internal and external security. In other words, we need to establish a regulatory framework for how we deal with data. I believe that this has been achieved here, although – as the rapporteur has already explained – a number of issues are still outstanding. In particular, close consideration is required when it comes to the question of the legal basis for the agreement, because this may give rise to legal uncertainty in the future. Nonetheless, I believe that the various associated guarantees, such as the entitlement to inspect data, the right to make corrective adjustments or to impose judicial remedies, offer citizens sufficient protection and also ensure effective controls over state intervention in personal rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to be quite clear about one thing: in a mobile world where international terrorism exists, the exchange of PNR data is an effective way to combat crime and means more security for Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe it is unfortunate that we have not been able to convince all groups of the need for this agreement. We would, however, be acting against the best interests of our citizens if we failed to exploit the opportunities available to us to protect them. After all, failure to vote in favour of this agreement means leaving our citizens with a lot less security in relation to data protection than would be available under the terms of the agreement. That is not what we have been elected for.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Ms in ’t Veld for her excellent, resolute approach to this matter and for the transparency that she has brought to the issue. I hope that her efforts will be rewarded tomorrow and that it will be possible for data to be exchanged without further delay.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, PNR data is nothing new – after all this information has been gathered since commercial aviation was in its infancy. Likewise, the use of this data, for example for border control purposes, is nothing new. Nonetheless, a problem arises here which is also familiar in other areas: in an increasingly mobile world with modern information technology, data is available in quite different dimensions than was the case 50 or even 30 years ago. This is also the reason why data protection is becoming increasingly important.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have achieved a great deal with this agreement: a clear definition of potential uses, good data protection standards and clear rules for legal certainty and judicial remedy. The changeover from the pull system to the push system is also important. Data is not simply collected, but is sent to Australia. We have not been able to achieve all our demands, however. One of the major points at issue from our perspective is the five-and-a-half-year retention period. We would have liked to see a much shorter period.</p>
      <p sl="de">So, what can we do about it? Do we vote in favour of the agreement or do we reject it? I would like to make two comments. We will never achieve one hundred per cent of our demands. So, we need to weigh things up. Data would continue to be transferred even if we rejected the agreement, however then we would have no clear rules on how this data should be handled. That is why I hope that this agreement will receive majority support tomorrow, despite many reservations. In relation to the forthcoming agreement with the US, I would like to state clearly: we want an agreement here too, but a 15-year retention period is a much longer time. I genuinely fail to see why we cannot change over completely to the push system here. We need to make improvements in this area. We want uniform standards for all agreements in relation to PNR data, rather than a patchwork of arrangements in which the rights of our citizens are dealt with in different ways.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I agree with others and particularly the rapporteur, Sophie in’t Veld, that this is a much tighter, more focused and stronger agreement than the one in the past. It is a much better agreement because of the role of the European Parliament. I congratulate all those involved in producing an agreement that most of us will be able to vote for, despite some weaknesses. But the strengths include those mentioned: a much tighter purpose definition to limit it to terrorism and serious transnational crime, the fact that it is ‘push’ only and that the data protection safeguards on rectification and erasure and redress and also the data security provisions are good, with for instance an audit record of all access. So like other speakers I hope that this can become something of a precedent for the other two agreements, and I would draw the attention of the US authorities in particular to this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">My main difficulty with the agreement is the fact that it does not deal up front with the question of profiling. The European Commission has dodged this issue for years. I did a report two and a half years ago on profiling, just before the last elections. The European Commission keeps using synonyms and keeps falling back on this phrase (which is in the agreement): that it bans any decision which significantly affects or produces an adverse legal effect on a passenger solely on the basis of the automated processing of data. The whole question of profiling goes further than that, and we need to address it, use the term, define it, say what is allowed, what is not allowed and what the safeguards are. I do not think it helps for the Commission to refuse to face up to this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have heard from others what may be wrong with this agreement, or where it may fall short in their view. Perhaps we should also focus on what is good about it and, more importantly, why we need it.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a vital tool which enables law enforcement agencies to prevent and combat the most serious of crimes and to capture the most serious of criminals: terrorists, murderers, people-traffickers, paedophiles, rapists and drug smugglers, to name but a few. To answer the critics, yes, we have a responsibility to our citizens to protect their data and their civil liberties, which I feel this agreement has done, but we also have an unavoidable responsibility to protect all the people of Europe from harm. That is why I, and my ECR colleagues, will be voting in favour of the agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we did try to hammer out better terms during the negotiations on the new PNR agreement. Naturally, people will disagree about what might be a better agreement. For me, however, it is important to point out that, when negotiating with third countries, we in the European Union must take care only to adopt legislation and negotiate agreements that are valid within the framework of our constitution and laws.</p>
      <p sl="de">Having read it, I must say that the agreement with Australia for the forwarding of European PNR data is not compatible with European law or with the constitutions of the Member States. Both the national constitutional courts of EU Member States and the European Court of Human Rights have declared firstly that the retention and processing of personal data without specific cause is in breach of fundamental rights. Secondly, they found that any practice that randomly compares people and their behaviour patterns with suspect profiles is in violation of human rights. Thirdly, they held that the comprehensive monitoring of all citizens without any grounds for suspicion violates the presumption of innocence.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we have on the table is an agreement that not only makes mass surveillance acceptable, but also infringes the fundamental principles of a democratic state under the rule of law. We in the European Parliament have clearly rejected the existing PNR data agreements for many years. I would like to know what has changed in the interim? There has been no change in relation to the long retention periods. Nor has there been any change in relation to the lack of suspicion when data is transferred. Opinions may differ in relation to what will happen if this agreement is rejected. We, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that there are limits that must be observed when negotiating agreements with other third countries and partners. In my opinion we should not legitimise every proposal we receive, but should simply stick to our principles.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is taking a clear stance against this agreement, and will vote accordingly, in the clear knowledge that there are some aspects of the agreement that might seem acceptable according to the principle of ‘a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush’. Of course we have understood this, thanks to Ms in ’t Veld. The counter-arguments are more convincing, however. We still have no proof of the need to record PNR data. The mass of data, or so-called waste data, actually makes it harder to find potential criminals. Despite everything, what we have here is a willy-nilly approach to data retention, even when no suspicion exists, and this, as my colleague has pointed out, is prohibited, not just in Germany but in several other Member States too.</p>
      <p sl="de">We wish to register genuinely serious concerns that this agreement cannot be reconciled with EU law. That is why we requested a corresponding legal opinion, which we are also presenting for the purposes of the discussion and vote. Even though it is, of course, better to a certain extent to have some sort of retention period rather than none at all, I would ask you seriously why it is necessary to store data for five-and-a-half years. This makes profiling realistic and feasible, particularly since it is not completely and definitively excluded by this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">A word about the scope of the agreement: the Commissioner referred to the fact that serious cross-border crime does not exist as a criminal offence in Australia. It simply does not exist. Instead of a minimum mandatory sentence of four years, we would have been better served with a list of specific criminal offences.</p>
      <p sl="de">Otherwise, our main concern is that this agreement will be used as the template for negotiations with the US, but not because the agreement is so bad, but rather because at least in Australia the data is processed by the customs authorities when it arrives there, while in the US, the responsible authority is the unknown quantity that is the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
      <p sl="de">This agreement turns innocent people into objects of suspicion on a wholesale basis and undermines elementary freedoms. My group wants nothing to do with this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, my mandate here in the European Parliament is to protect fundamental rights. I am not the long arm of the Australian customs authorities or the worldwide travel industry. For this reason, I do not intend voting in favour of this agreement tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore I would like to point out that no other agreement allows data to be retained for so long without depersonalisation. Australia has no data protection provisions commensurate with the EU standards. Profiling is not entirely excluded. This was a key demand from the European Parliament, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">This House would do well finally to question this vast array of security measures, at last taking a stand against this development and against the threat of a preventionist state. A state that tries to be at the scene of the crime before the perpetrator and before any crime is committed will finally lose legitimacy and fail. For this reason, I do not intend voting in favour of the initiative of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. I will vote in favour of the finding of the Court of Justice of the European Union. This is a very good initiative. I hope this initiative will gain majority support in the House tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we all want to live in safety. In order to achieve this, preventive measures are necessary, particularly when it comes to the prevention of terrorist activities and international crime. This is precisely the reason why security authorities throughout the world gather and analyse PNR data. However, in order to ensure that data is no longer transferred, stored and used in an uncontrolled way, as has been the case up to now, but will, in future, comply with legal requirements, the European Union is concluding this series of agreements with various states.</p>
      <p sl="de">While it is, as we all know, quite a complicated matter to reach a result with the US because we have a different legal and security culture, we have managed to hammer out a very good agreement with Australia. I regard a number of points as being of particular importance. For example, I believe that the parameters for application are clearly defined and restricted, namely the combating of terrorist activity and serious cross-border crime, that EU citizens in Australia enjoy full legal protection to a very high standard, that the push system is being followed, and that data protection is assured at a very high level. Last but not least, this agreement also enables passengers to be checked in quickly and securely on flights to Australia.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that this agreement can act as a benchmark for the other agreements that the European Union intends concluding with various states.</p>

The negotiated agreement is basically fine. In the future, however, we should focus on a number of important areas.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should try in future negotiations to reduce the period of detention, and it would surely be worth considering incorporating the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Commissioner, not only through Article 87 on police cooperation, but also through Article 16 on data protection. Last but not least, we must legislate for the option of profiling. The agreement with Australia may not mention the option of profiling explicitly, but nor does it prohibit it, despite repeated requests. At the same time, I would like to call on the Commission in future to request an opinion from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights regarding such specific agreements. Despite its shortcomings, I believe that the agreement with Australia sets a good precedent, and that Parliament will also be able to approve similar agreements with other countries in the foreseeable future.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, it is now quite clear that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is going to vote against this agreement with Australia. What Australia really wants to do with the personal data of European passengers remains totally unclear. This Parliament has asked for a guarantee that Australia will not build profiles based on personal data for the purpose of singling out for different treatment passengers who are under no suspicion. We have not received that guarantee. Obviously, we did not receive the guarantee because profiling is the reason why the authorities – not just in Australia, but also in the United States and Canada, and perhaps in the European Union too, in the future – want to collect passenger data.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why should that be? There is still no evidence that storing passenger data is helpful in the fight against terrorism. If investigation services want a particular passenger’s data, they can request it from airline companies. They are really not going to throw that information away once the passenger has disembarked. Therefore, no authorities anywhere need to store data for five and a half years. For five and a half years in Australia, that is for decades in the United States, and who knows how long the storage time will be in the European PNR in the future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I reject the rapporteur’s argument that this agreement with Australia will have a positive impact on our negotiations with the US and Canada. On the contrary, this agreement seems to be a sign of just how bad these agreements can get. Long retention periods, data transfer to other institutions, even foreign intelligence services, and the risk that Europeans might be refused entry into Australia on the basis of their profiles. No, this is not about the Greens voting ‘no’ as a mere gesture, for if this House were to say ‘no’, that agreement would be illegal and then the transfer of data would be illegal. That is also why we support the request for an investigation into the fundamental rights of the PNR.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it may well be that better terms were negotiated in the agreement on PNR data with Australia than with the US. This changes nothing in relation to the basic problem of data protection, however, because the storing of PNR data has nothing to do with the identification of suspects at border checkpoints. On the contrary, what will happen is that the data belonging to all passengers will be stored willy-nilly where no grounds for suspicion exist in order subsequently to identify risky travellers.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is particularly problematic that this huge infringement of fundamental rights is carried out in the name of combating terrorism, even though there is no evidence proving that PNR data is of any benefit in the fight against terrorism. Experts actually believe that even those individual successful investigations put forward to justify the retention of PNR data would also have been possible without PNR. Thus, we should not regard it as progress that the push procedure is to be used to forward data to Australia, after all this is the only regulation that is even half-way compatible with EU data protection law.</p>
      <p sl="de">Accordingly, data protection will remain illusory, even in relation to the agreement with Australia. In general, we should put an end to the practice of passing on data where no grounds for suspicion exist.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, to me this report proves that if we make an effort to understand and respect each other’s viewpoints and find common solutions, then we can achieve a balanced position in the European Parliament and a good agreement.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would just like to mention one point that perhaps goes beyond the scope of this specific report – but which seems to have been relegated to the background in our discussions recently – namely the principle of reciprocity. In other words, we should not just provide but also receive passenger data from our partners. This is clearly a rather controversial question, and relates to the establishment of a European PNR system.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am aware that opinions vary widely on this issue. Those who fear it and reject it are concerned that it will provide even greater scope for invasion of privacy. But I think that, within an alliance, if one fully upholds and respects relations with one’s alliance partners, but acts on an equal footing – and indeed equality is a condition for reciprocity – then perhaps one is in a stronger position in terms of human rights guarantees too.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is no coincidence for example that in defence policy, too, an idea increasingly coming to the fore at present is that Europe as an entity should be defined more robustly and strengthened, within the alliance too, of course. I therefore think that we should give consideration to a European PNR system in the same way as this report was produced, by seeking consensus, but speed up the process.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is all the more important because, if the Commission decides to proceed with this, and Parliament gives the go-ahead for the establishment of an independent PNR system, then we will have a great deal of work to do, though of course there is no time to go into the details here. I would be very interested to hear Commissioner Malmström’s opinion on this. We will certainly also need to create the appropriate organisational framework, but it would probably be a great help to Member States if data transfer requests were able to take place not only on a bilateral basis.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, despite the reservations and fears expressed here, tomorrow will probably see the European Parliament giving its consent for the first time to a PNR agreement under which the transfer of passenger name record data will more or less conform to the criteria which Parliament formulated in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We know that it is difficult to strike a balance between security and data protection. These criteria are nevertheless important, and this recommendation for a draft resolution contains most of them. Some unresolved issues remain, such as the five-and-a-half-year retention period, but the agreement does ensure that citizens have access to appropriate legal remedies. In fact, data can only be collected and retained if this is necessary for the purpose of preventing and detecting terrorist offences or serious transnational crime. In addition, close monitoring of the agreement’s implementation is a further guarantee that Parliament will, if necessary, be able to propose the suspension or termination of the agreement. An agreement of this sort can serve as a point of reference for future agreements, for example with the USA, Canada, and the other countries that have approached the Commission on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in a conversation with the Australian authorities about the passenger name record (PNR) issue, they told me what it would take for a person, a passenger on an aircraft, to be subjected to greater surveillance at Australian borders: this would happen if the name on the ticket were not consistent with the name on his credit card, for example, or if he made sudden changes to his route, or if had travelled through countries deemed dangerous. I found this strange because, in my case, with my Portuguese name which is made up of five names – that is, two personal names and three surnames – I fell into all these categories, and some of the reasons for this were that I was acting in the service of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, this story has a broader significance, which it is important that the public understand: namely, that we have become used to being investigated as if we were suspected of a crime, and what is happening with this new model of investigation is that we are investigated even when we are innocent and not under suspicion. At this point, when we are going to vote on the first PNR agreement, which is the first time that we are legalising this kind of transfer in Parliament, it is crucial that the public know this, and we have not been sufficiently clear on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In short, I am concerned about several things in this agreement, including the consistency of our arguments about the time for which data should be stored. We in Europe are talking about months, but according to this agreement the data will be kept for five and a half years. As for issues of proportionality and whether a proportionality test has been approved or not, in her explanatory statement the rapporteur herself says that this proportionality test has not exactly been proven. I would like to say here that I am very sorry not to be voting in the same way as the rapporteur, who is a colleague, and I have no doubt that she has major concerns about the freedoms, civil rights and privacy of the European public. Nevertheless, I still do not believe that this agreement sets a good standard for what other foreign countries will ask of us further down the line, and what we say to the Australians now, we will also have to say to the US, Saudi Arabia and Korea.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, first of all, I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms in ‘t Veld, for her exceptional efforts.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The PNR Agreement with Australia is largely satisfactory, marking a step forward compared with the previous negotiations of this kind. The positive aspects derive from the fact that automatic data processing is banned in principle and also that means are provided for administrative and judicial appeals against possible abuses.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, issues still remain with some aspects. I am referring here not only to how long the data can be kept for, but also to the transfer of data to third countries. I also want to point out to the Commission that, just now when cyber attacks have become increasingly frequent and more widespread, we must have a guarantee that PNR data is stored and transferred under maximum security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Future agreements, especially those currently being negotiated with the US and Canada, must take a quantum leap and clear up the current misunderstandings which persist.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the approval by the European Parliament of the first agreement on the transfer of passenger name record data with a third country is an historic moment and it is happening because account has been taken, perhaps not of all, but of most of the European Parliament’s main concerns and comments.</p>
      <p sl="el">Protection of personal data – and I think that we all agree here – is a very sensitive and important issue to European citizens and, as such, the European Parliament needs to fight – and it is fighting – to defend the rights of the European citizens that we have all been elected to represent.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let us hope that negotiations on the agreement with the United States and Canada continue and end in the same spirit. Today’s approval of the agreement illustrates that, despite the differences between our and a third country’s legal system, it is possible to negotiate at European level and dubious bilateral agreements with individual Member States can be avoided.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to take this opportunity to stress that the European Parliament wishes to see a clear link between the agreement being negotiated with the US and the general agreement on transatlantic protection of personal data also under negotiation.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to express my serious concern at the fact that Article 16 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the protection of personal data – which is the appropriate legal basis – was not taken as the legal basis. May I remind the House that the European Data Protection Supervisor has also expressed reservations on this point.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we live in a world that has changed hugely in recent years – unimaginable 50 years ago – where there is great freedom to travel. But with that freedom has come some dangers. In particular we have seen how a terrorist can strike with devastating effect and how criminals have great ingenuity in getting whatever they require. There is a need for governments in particular to try to protect their citizens. The difficulty is where you draw the line, in particular between security and data protection, profiling, etc. But I think that, on balance, we are getting that balance right. What we have is not perfect but is certainly a basis for improving matters as we go forward, particularly when we are talking about agreements with the US and Canada, etc. It is a start: it is not perfect but is a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Parliament is currently examining the proposal for a directive on the use of passenger name record data for preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences or serious crimes. After this has been adopted, bilateral agreements between the European Union and third countries on passenger name record data must be updated accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The length of period for retaining data should be reduced considerably. I should mention that in the case of the Data Retention Directive relating to telephony operators, for the same purposes, the constitutional courts in Romania, Germany and the Czech Republic considered that these provisions violated citizens’ fundamental rights and declared the relevant transposing acts unconstitutional.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call for:</p>
      <p sl="ro">1. the analysis and transfer of PNR data to be used solely to prevent and detect terrorist offences and serious crimes, including for conducting investigations, and to prosecute them;</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the discussions on international agreements on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (PNR) data with Australia, Canada and the US always raise the question of compliance with the rights of EU citizens in the area of personal data protection. In the case of this agreement with Australia, it is also impossible to avoid certain doubts as to whether the handling of data on EU citizens by the Australian security services will conform to EU law. The fact that the agreement bypasses the well-known criteria of the European Parliament for granting consent to the signing of agreements with third countries on the transfer of PNR data, shows that the Commission has either failed to do its work in an entirely professional way, or is to some extent indifferent to the opinion of the European Parliament and thus to the directly elected legitimate representatives of the people of Europe, which is even more serious, in my view. I firmly believe that the European Parliament is determined to cooperate with all countries in the fight against terrorism, but this must not be at the cost of violating the fundamental rights of our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will try to answer a few of the questions raised. On the question of necessity, the Commission has held quite a lot of meetings with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to try to explain, with examples from the US and Australia, the necessity and use of PNR. These sessions have been restricted because they are, of course, sensitive. I know that US representatives have also met members of that committee. We on the Commission side are, of course, willing to continue those meetings and to provide further examples and explanations if you wish.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand your frustration concerning the question of profiling, Baroness Ludford. It is indeed rather frustrating, because there is no legal definition of this: that is the problem. We do not have a legal definition and we cannot invent one. That is something we need to address. That is why we have this non-automatic process, in order to adhere as closely as possible to our own standards. You might not like this, but it is the only basis on which we can move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">A question was raised about the Fundamental Rights Agency. We did ask them for an opinion, but they told us that it was beyond their mandate to give an opinion on an international agreement, so they could not do so. We have, of course, consulted widely in other areas, but we cannot get a formal opinion from the Agency.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are discussing today is the result of international negotiations between the European Union and Australia. We tried to achieve something together. In a negotiation – as we know, because we are very used to negotiating in the European Union – you give and take. You will not get 100%, but everybody will try to get the maximum possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Australia is, like every country in the world, entitled to collect passenger name data from the passengers who land there. All countries are allowed to do that, which is why the Commission has proposed a European PNR system. We will discuss that at some other time. Like it or not, it is a fact. Air carriers can be forced to provide these data, which they have been collecting since the beginning – for decades – for commercial purposes. Those data can be requested by a Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our task is to make sure that these agreements are as robust as possible when it comes to protecting fundamental rights, and as clear as possible when it comes to limiting their scope to what is absolutely necessary. We must also make sure that the freedoms and integrity of passengers are protected as much as possible, and that provision is made for redress, erasure, access etc. I think that we have achieved this, and the agreement is very close to the resolution that you adopted a year or so ago, and the mandate given by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">There will also be a review. The agreement will be reviewed by the authorities in Australia, where of course there are also concerns about data protection, and there will be reviews from the EU side. Again, we have not yet got 100% of what we asked for, but I think most of our concerns are addressed here. I believe that this is a good agreement that takes into consideration both our aim to fight serious organised crime and terrorism, and the need to protect the freedoms and fundamental rights of the passengers. Thank you very much for your collaboration and the good spirit in which this debate has been conducted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to address a few words to my friends in the Green Group and the GUE/NGL Group, though unfortunately Jan Albrecht has left.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are politicians. We are not activists. Sometimes we face very different dilemmas. I think everybody in this House – and this has been expressed by every single speaker – is facing those dilemmas, but we have to take tough decisions. Sometimes it hurts, and it hurts all of us – even the ones who are going to vote in favour.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say to Ms Sargentini, who spoke about the consequences of rejecting the agreement, saying that, if we reject the agreement, the transfer of data will become illegal and can no longer be transferred. That is true, but then what? Are we going to suspend air travel altogether? I recognise that this would fit in with another Green objective, namely that of reducing CO2 emissions, which is a good objective, but it is not very realistic. Frankly, unless you can provide a credible alternative, a ‘no’ vote is purely symbolic and cheap.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to remind colleagues that we have to stick together because this is only the first step, as my colleague Mr Kelly rightly said. This is the first agreement. It is also the first step in a long process. It is the first reversal of the trend of unrestricted collection of data, and we are facing other negotiations. We are in the middle of very tough negotiations with Canada and the United States. It is more important than ever that we stick together, that we show the rest of the world that Europe is united and that we do stand up for fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect I would very much like to echo in particular the words of my colleague, Ms Sippel, about ‘push-pull’. We have emphasised very strongly how important it is that this agreement concerns ‘push’ only and not ‘pull’. That was in Parliament’s resolution and we will stick by it in the agreement with Australia and in other agreements that follow.</p>
