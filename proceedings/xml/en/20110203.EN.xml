      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the proposal for a regulation establishing an ACP Banana Accompanying Measures programme is today being tabled for a second reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a reminder, we appealed at first reading for as many accompanying measures as possible for ACP banana-exporting countries, whose situation is liable to be made worse by the entry into force, within the WTO, of an agreement with US and Latin American producers to end the trade dispute over customs duties on bananas. Under the agreement, import duties on bananas will gradually be reduced from EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne by the year 2017.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, bananas from ACP countries will continue to enjoy duty-free access within the European Union. The deterioration in these countries’ situation following the entry into force of the trade agreement has led them to negotiate Banana Accompanying Measures, or BAM for short, with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Committee on Development, for which I am the rapporteur, was able to secure the adoption at first reading of the following improvements to the initial text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, emphasis has been placed on the eradication of poverty and the improvement of living conditions as main objectives of the recommended measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, small farmers and small entities are regarded as the main beneficiaries of these measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, the regulation pays particular attention to aspects relating to the environment, health and labour standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly, transparent criteria have been introduced for allocating funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, an agreement has been reached on a provisional assessment, which must be carried out 18 months before the programme expires.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement on the financing of the accompanying measures for 2010 and 2011. All of these advances easily meet the expectations of the ACP countries. The only sticking point concerns the horizontal issue of the application of delegated acts to the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI). Our interpretation of Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon backs up our demand.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament wishes to have its say in the strategic decisions that the Commission takes with regard to the financing of external action. Until now, the Council has refused to grant Parliament the role that it deserves in the functioning of the financing instruments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Matters must be made clear, and I would insist very strongly on the following point: we refuse to be called troublemakers. Parliament and the Committee on Development prove this every day in their work. I therefore invite my fellow Members to maintain the position adopted at first reading and to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the text that I have just submitted for their approval.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010-000" speaker_id="96728" name="Barbara LOCHBIHLER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="20-05-1959" birth_place="Obergünzburg" p_group="Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, a guarantee of human rights, the promotion and development of democratic structures and combating corruption are the central demands of those taking to the streets in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen – by peaceful means and in the hope of thereby achieving change, so that people in Maghreb and in the Arab world can assert their right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, their right to free elections and their right to civil participation. The implementation of these rights is precisely what our financing instrument for democracy and human rights wants to promote; up until now, it has had limited opportunities to act in the countries mentioned because the circumstances there are such that in general, those who were of a different opinion could expect persecution and torture.</p>
      <p sl="de">I very much welcome the fact that, as we heard yesterday in the working party, the Commission has already made detailed plans to use the financing instrument in such a way that there will now be short-term, medium-term and long-term projects, which can now be used to support the democratic transformation in Tunisia. It would be good if in the future we could develop a model from this that can also be used should such a fundamental transformation come about in other states. I very much hope that the Commission will take up the suggestions made by the parliamentary delegation to Tunisia, such as on reform of the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="de">The instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights is structured in such a way as to be able to support those in the different civil structures who are working for improvements in the human rights situation. This could be governments, it could be international human rights institutions or it could be individuals who need support as defenders of human rights. Overall, it is a good structure precisely because it makes it possible in certain situations to act without the consent of the government concerned. I do not see this in any way as interfering in internal affairs, because it is in the nature of human rights that we need to be able to resist state compulsion and state violence against the population – against the individual citizen.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, we need to review the individual projects, as well as the priorities of the human rights and democracy instrument, and subject these to continual critical evaluation. Until now the instrument was still relatively new, so there was no point in carrying out an evaluation that would tell us little. It is thus all the more important that we now prepare and implement the forthcoming comprehensive evaluation. The aim must be to clarify the effects of individual measures and to allow us to rethink priorities and working methods where relevant.</p>
      <p sl="de">This financing instrument shares the basic principle that there should be complementarity between all financing instruments. Yet we repeatedly find in practice that this relatively modest financial instrument is being used to fund projects that could be clearly linked to a geographical instrument. This issue also arises in the case of human rights dialogues. For this reason we should definitely not agree to any cuts in this modest instrument and we must also see that it is not used to fund projects for which it is not in fact appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, regarding the delegated acts – a matter on which we have yet to reach agreement for any of the financing instruments. In many policy areas, such as the environment and transport, there is no dispute as to what may be regarded as delegated acts. In foreign policy, however, this is seen as highly contentious. It is very important, however – particularly post the Treaty of Lisbon – that we as Parliament also have codecision rights in foreign policy, at the level of the strategic focus of financing instrument programmes.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011-000" speaker_id="28150" name="Kinga GÁL" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Hungary" m_state="HU">
      <p sl="hu">Madam President, representatives of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, all that Mrs Lochbihler, my co-rapporteur, has said is of very great importance when we consider that the current tense international situation – I am thinking of the North African cases debated yesterday, of Tunisia and Egypt – shows that the attention we devote to, for example, this financing instrument for human rights does indeed matter, and the impact this instrument has in practice in a specific place may be important. This is precisely the first important reason why Parliament demands the right of scrutiny with regard to the instrument.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards the substantive issues discussed in the debate at first reading in October last year, which aimed at promoting the operation of local non-governmental organisations of key importance, the institutions were in agreement. Now, at second reading, the other side of the coin must be addressed, namely agreement on the inter-institutional debate on Parliament’s right to democratic scrutiny. It is well-known that the issue of financing instruments, including the question of this instrument promoting democracy and human rights, has been part of an inter-institutional battle for a year.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Treaty of Lisbon strengthened the European Parliament’s right to democratic scrutiny; this in fact is the institution of delegated acts, which we believe needs to be enforced and applied in the current situation. This specific package, the case of delegated acts, is what could be the first significant example that the role of the European Parliament has indeed grown since 1 December 2009. Thus at second reading, and in all probability during the subsequent agreement process, we, too, are fighting for the recognition of the European Parliament’s right to democratic scrutiny, and I believe, together with my colleague, that this is relevant precisely in the case of the financing instrument for democracy and human rights. This is because, as we have just heard, this instrument is intended to serve human rights, the rule of law and the protection of democracy, and we are promoting specific rights such as the fight for women’s and children’s rights, and the struggles against capital punishment, torture and cruel, inhuman, humiliating treatment. We aim to help defenders of human rights in their work, even under the most impossible conditions. This is another reason why this instrument is especially important. Its beneficiaries are non-governmental organisations, which are subject to serious disadvantages in some countries. All this justifies that we, Parliament, should have a say in shaping the strategy and the framework programmes and in devising future plans, as we can take more serious steps through annual monitoring than simply by having our opinions asked at the biennial financial cycles. This is what we are asking your support for, so that now in the period following the Treaty of Lisbon we may truly act in the spirit of the Treaty as well, and I trust that both the Commission and the Council will understand the necessity of this during the forthcoming agreement process.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012-000" speaker_id="96646" name="Helmut SCHOLZ" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="21-06-1954" birth_place="Berlin" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (ICI) is being fundamentally amended in this parliamentary term. We plan to jointly allocate up to EUR 348 million to cooperation in areas such as science, academic exchanges – including Erasmus Mundus –, culture, environmental protection and renewable energy, as well as the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration should be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new aspect is that with what is known as ICI Plus, projects in developing countries can now also be financed – and specifically projects that do not fall under the general definition of development aid measures. These include projects and measures such as sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America – a completely new element. In the current times, when the EU has a greater responsibility to realign its cooperation in partnership with a growing number of states, allowing self-determined development has a particular part to play in this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The recast of the regulation needs to clearly mark the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It clearly states who can obtain financial assistance, for what purposes and on what terms. Another new element of this instrument is that the regulation specifies that the allocation of funding must ensure that the partner countries comply with the core working standards of the International Labour Organisation and that they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an important contribution to the international fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">Equally important, the rule of law and human dignity in work are elevated to cooperation objectives. As we are going into the second reading, allow me to restate that I consider it essential to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. In the plenary vote at first reading it was decided – albeit by a narrow majority – that none of the funds allocated to development aid thus far should be devoted to ICI Plus.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are going into the second reading with an accelerated rapprochement on this, as on all the financing instruments. Following successful compromise negotiations between Council and the European Parliament we have adapted ICI Plus to the challenges of the future. All the matters of substance have been approved by a majority in plenary. So far, so good – or so it would seem. However, it remains undecided how we will deal in future with the division of powers between the two legislative bodies of the EU resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, particularly in the area of communitarised international trade policy. The issue at stake here is democracy, and specifically what are known as delegated acts – which is something on which the European Parliament and the Commission and Council continue to have differing views.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is this all about? We want to do what we see as our duty to our electorate. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulations is in accordance with the spirit of the legislator. In the past the Commission has unfortunately too often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us a new role and duty as a legislator, and we demand a right of veto. The rapporteurs for the various foreign policy financing instruments, the chairs of the committees and the leaders of the groups are all agreed that we must fight for this democratic right.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conduct we have seen so far shows that not all three bodies of the European Union have yet recognised this principle. We are therefore vigorously defending our right of control today because in future the Commission must base its planning on what the legislator has laid down, not on its own communications.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am here to replace Andris Piebalgs, who is abroad due to a long foreseen engagement, on the second debate on these external relations financial instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">My first words are those of thanks to the rapporteurs, Ms Gál, Ms Lochbihler, Mr Mitchell, Mr Scholz and Mr Goerens. We have cooperated very well on these files and, apart from delegated acts, there is a lot of convergence in substance among the three institutions concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">The remaining outstanding issues are due to the wider interinstitutional relationship in a new Treaty environment. We now find ourselves at a difficult political and operational juncture that partners abroad do not understand, because implementation of basic acts is an internal EU affair.</p>
      <p sl="en">Though as Trade Commissioner I am not responsible for any of these instruments, they do support a whole range of EU policy objectives, including trade, and allow us to remain relevant as foreign policy actors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since your last debate in October, the year ended without a first-reading agreement. You know the situation. Parliament expects Article 290 of the Treaty, outlining the procedure known as delegated acts, to be applied to the adoption of strategy papers and multiannual action programmes. But in its first-reading position the Council rejected those of your amendments relating to delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very important that we come to an agreement soon, in particular for ICI Plus and the proposal for banana accompanying measures. Otherwise the Commission is unable to implement the relevant budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">More specifically for ICI Plus, I think that everyone agrees that this instrument is designed to promote EU interests in industrialised countries, some of them key strategic partners who will not wait for us to be administratively ready. Others are competing to fill in gaps we create, whether it be energy cooperation, business support, digital agenda objectives, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the banana accompanying measures, I can only stress, with some resonance I hope as Trade Commissioner, that they are integrally linked with the Geneva Agreement which brought an end to our longest trade dispute in WTO and GATT, which lasted almost 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The accompanying measures are intended to support 10 banana-exporting ACP countries in their adaptation to a reduction in their preferential margin as a result of the Geneva Agreement. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that we preserve the EU’s credibility as an international trade negotiator by honouring our commitments and, in this case, we owe it especially to ACP banana-producing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Look at the broader picture of world food trade at the moment and the hardship faced in some countries that are heavily dependent on export revenues from one or few commodities. I really feel a sense of urgency here.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand Parliament’s concern to be involved in the strategy papers and multiannual programming. The Commission has come forward with proposals to enhance parliamentary scrutiny and offers other compromise solutions, but these have failed to gain traction both in Parliament and in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am here today to reiterate the commitment Catherine Ashton and Andris Piebalgs made to you last October to seek practical political solutions. Let us, Council, Commission, Parliament, work towards agreed outcomes now during the second reading and all engage purposefully to achieve this objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Further delays carry with them budgetary, political, legal and even socio-economic consequences. At the same time as the Lisbon Treaty changed the comitology system and assigned new powers to the European Parliament, it endowed the EU with a stronger role and new structures to pursue foreign policy more coherently, more comprehensively and with greater commonality. Thank you for your attention and I am looking forward to the debate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today give its verdict for a second time on the amendment to the financing instrument for development cooperation providing for the establishment of Banana Accompanying Measures for the main ACP banana-producing countries. These accompanying measures are justified by the reduction in tariff preferences granted to the ACP countries following the conclusion, in December 2009, of the Geneva Agreement with the United States and the countries of Latin America. The European Union made a commitment at that time to provide EUR 190 million in support to the ACP countries to help them cope with this new competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We amended both the form and the content of the Commission proposal at first reading. The Council disagreed with us on the form, which is why the regulation has been submitted for a second reading today. Indeed, the Council refused to allow the delegated acts procedure to be applied to strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes, and hence refused to implement the advances of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament decided to react quickly, and that is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore sending a strong political message to the ACP countries. The European Parliament is behind them and is doing everything in its power to ensure that the EUR 190 million are released as quickly as possible. Yet we are also sending a message to the Council. The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. The ball is now in the Council’s court. The European Union made a commitment to the ACP countries. The Council should therefore shoulder its responsibilities, as Parliament has done.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Thank you for your question, Lord Dartmouth. All I would say is that there are international agreements in place that require the European Union to invest in its relations with the ACP countries, and this is one of the agreements that the European Union must prioritise.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the position unanimously adopted today by our Parliament shows just how vitally important the issue of implementing powers is to this House. Nevertheless, to turn to the subject of the Banana Accompanying Measures, this agreement is embarrassing with regard to our ACP banana-producing partners. Indeed, one year after these countries legitimately obtained compensation from the Commission, they have still not received the funds, even though the Geneva Agreement is hitting them hard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, they are the ones I am addressing again today when I say that it is precisely because we want to relay our demands even further that this House must have its say in the EU’s strategy and general guidelines for external aid.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this issue has technical considerations and it also has human, poverty considerations. In this joint debate I would first like to tell the Council that Parliament is here to monitor and check, and look with openness and transparency and accountability at the way we spend our taxpayers’ money in terms of international development.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the Council cannot recognise that, and cannot recognise that delegated acts should go through Parliament’s internal procedures so that it can avail itself of the right of scrutiny, then what the heck are we doing here? Why are we here if we are not allowed to be accountable to our voters, constituents and taxpayers over the money that they give us in good faith to spend, through the Commission, on international development?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on the issue of bananas, in which Parliament’s considerations should also be taken into account, the European taxpayer has lost on both counts. We had a freer trade agreement which has now gone ‘phut’, and what we now have to do is to indemnify and compensate those banana-producing countries again.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to address a few points. First of all I want to raise the issue of flexibility of financing instruments in the external area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last few weeks and months we have all seen a lot of unforeseen catastrophes and events unfolding, and under the external heading we have almost no more margins left, while there are still a few years to go. At the same time there is one instrument which is flexible, namely the Stability Instrument, which is then often used for other purposes than it was actually created for.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think we can agree that we need more flexibility in the foreign policy instruments, but we must underline that this can only go with enhanced democratic scrutiny at the same time. We are currently fighting on this issue, and we also need to signal that, while for the future of the financial instruments there needs to be more flexibility, we cannot go ahead with that without the enhanced democratic scrutiny that we ask for.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second point: we have to rethink how we do our work and provide our aid in fragile states. Just yesterday the UN made once again the link between development and conflict, and pointed out that those countries that are in conflict are, of course, those that have the hardest time getting out of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">So far the EU instruments have not really been adapted. We have EU missions in some of these fragile states working alongside, but not always together with, our financial instruments. So we have to reflect on what would be a good way of combining these two.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should make it clear that in the case of these financing instruments we attach importance to making a distinction between legislative and executive tasks. It is not the job of a parliament to carry out detailed management or to actually implement projects.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, legislation must not result in a carte blanche being given for years on end with no ability to intervene if the action taken is not in accordance with the legislator’s will. Consequently, whether or not this is a delegated act in legal terms, we must have the possibility of revoking decisions if, in the legislator’s opinion, they are not being executed in accordance with the spirit intended by the legislator.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason – regardless of the legal ruling under which it was carried out, or whether or not it was carried out within the framework of delegated acts – the Commission and the Council must act in this matter in order to find a reasonable, objective solution; this will also lead to us interfering less in executive matters and therefore, where everything runs properly, will give the executive body greater freedom.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to endorse what Mrs Brandtner said. Parliament implemented the instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights years ago, providing the possibility of bypassing governments and dictators in order to support civil society and democratic forces. We are only now establishing that contrary to the will of the legislator, the Commission or now the External Action Service has never used this instrument in this way, which is a decisive element of the fact that we find ourselves in this situation in North Africa today. Since this is a political failure – a failure to execute the will of the legislator – the regulation must be amended, and we intend to fight for this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, out with Mubarak, now! The resistance forces are still shouting on Tahrir Square and I am shouting with them. The demonstrations in Egypt, Tunisia and other Arab countries, with millions of citizens braving the streets to bring to an end to decades of oppression and corruption, show that human rights and democracy are universal aspirations and also how all those calling for stability to sustain dictatorships are flying in the face of history.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The democracy and human rights instrument is a tool of the European Union that can and must be used, without the consent of governments, in support of the defenders of human rights and those who promote gender equality, the rule of law, free elections and democracy. Therefore, it must be strengthened financially, made flexible to deal with emergencies and be better coordinated with geographically focused instruments in the promotion of the same objectives. It must be under adequate parliamentary scrutiny. Hence the insistence of this Parliament on the delegated acts procedure.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, both Mrs Gomes and Mrs Lochbihler are right when they say that the events in Egypt and Tunisia should be receiving our support and should be attracting our attention, and indeed the instruments which we are debating, today, do create this possibility, particularly the financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide. It is my conviction that this should be very strongly supported, because, indeed – as Mrs Gomes said – these rights are universal, and, this being so, the right to live in a democracy and the right to live in a country which accepts human rights are something which is quite obvious.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is important that the second instrument allows for this assistance to be given irrespective of the consent of the governments of third countries and other public authorities. This is something very important. Our assistance is needed by Belarus and Ukraine, it is also needed by other countries of the Eastern Partnership, and I think these instruments should be used, too, for these very countries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we are discussing here a series of packages concerning financial instruments, such as the Goerens report on a financial instrument for development cooperation, the report by my colleague, Mr Scholz, and others. The majority of the reports aim for specific measures that could improve the lives of millions of people: in other words, legislative practice at its best.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the Council insists on not completing the codecision that these instruments require. It is here that the process of codecision becomes a process of co-indecision by virtue of a tacit veto by the Council, which nothing in the reading of the Treaty justifies, and which is founded solely on capricious displeasure and an esoteric reading of Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which describes delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is putting people’s lives at risk. With regard to the refugee resettlement policy, for example, we have been prevented from giving extra money to resettlement countries and closing refugee camps, which means that if the Council persists in continuing with this whim, people’s lives will be detrimentally affected. It is time for this to stop and for delegated acts to develop normally in the codecision process.</p>

      <p sl="bg">We must also have subsequent control because billions and billions of euros are being poured into some programmes, which usually end up in the pockets of various dictators, financing their fine lifestyle, while, at the same time, millions and millions of people are living in our own countries, who are also leading very miserable lives.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This also means that we are using European taxpayers’ money to finance the luxury lifestyle of dictators who are oppressing their own peoples, while our own citizens are badly off.

However, we may need more money, and when it comes to the new financial perspective we must not go back to the old argument that we should get rid of this regulation.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, development aid is always costly, often unfortunately ineffective and sometimes even harmful, because it all too frequently does not deal with the specific problems of the country in question. There is rarely any attempt to take a long-term approach and the activities are poorly coordinated. In my opinion, it is doubtful whether an EU-wide financing instrument for development and human rights can improve the situation, particularly as there is no consistent coordination within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Giving aid to small African farmers, while at the same time bringing them to the brink of ruin with our subsidised agricultural products, ultimately means that we are throwing billions of euros down the drain. This will not change to any significant extent as long as we continue supporting large companies in the EU and indirectly in the developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">China’s development aid, which the government in Beijing is using to secure raw materials and new markets, is in competition with our traditional development cooperation methods. In this area too, we will have to come up with some new ideas.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this Parliament is asking for what every parliament in the world is asking: democratic scrutiny of the development and implementation of policy. The European Union should serve as a model, as an example, in that respect. The Treaty of Lisbon has been a major step forward in developing the European Parliament’s influence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is in this House a large majority which has not given into Council and Commission efforts to curtail parliamentary scrutiny, which is contrary to the spirit of the Treaty.

This is therefore about strategic choices, about the content of policy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we would probably not have discussed cooperation with the developing countries if the European Union’s founding states had not requested a special mention in the Treaty of Rome for the colonies that they possessed, which casts a shadow over the concept of democracy to start with. The European Union’s very foundation has gradually transformed into a policy whose key concepts have become eradication of poverty and the promotion of human rights, basic freedoms, decent work and good governance.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nowadays, developing countries are strategic partners for the European Union. This is why I believe that a financial instrument for developing countries which do not meet the ODA criteria facilitates economic, financial, technical, cultural and academic cooperation.

Although our High Representatives in the European Union are not in a position or are not prepared to support and encourage those people who are fighting for democracy, it is good at least to be able to take action and provide help, even if we are not talking. However, it is very important for us to combine the aid we provide with a requirement to comply with our values, including democracy, the rule of law and core labour standards. It is essential for the European Union to provide help. In addition, we must not only help these people, but also ensure that they understand the values which have made us strong.</p>
      <p sl="de">Given that this is the case, it is clear to me that this aid must ultimately be controlled and managed by a democratic Parliament.

I support the idea of the Union adopting a pragmatic approach in its economic relations with partner countries.</p>

Proper implementation of our external actions should not be taken hostage by a dispute between the institutions.

      <p sl="en">In the current instruments, which are in force until 2013, which means another two years, multiannual strategy papers are considered to be implementing measures necessary for the implementation of the budget. Such measures are subject to the comitology system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Strategy papers are technical documents, and so by their nature are not suited to take the form of binding legal acts. The current instruments have only two more years to run and there remain only a few strategy papers to be put in place.

We do not want to be troublemakers, but neither do we want to give the Commission carte blanche to implement fundamental agreements adopted by the European Parliament without there being any parliamentary oversight. Between having everything or nothing, Parliament insisted on a sensible solution that consists in closely monitoring strategic acts. We are demanding nothing more and nothing less than that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say a word about those who were more critical in their remarks, specifically those who spoke rather sceptically about development cooperation policy, and those who always refer to the taxpayer in order to reject any support for development cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From my point of view, the taxpayer finances a budget. A budget is an instrument for showing solidarity with the least well off. Hence, thanks to taxpayers’ contributions, the budget generally provides an opportunity for our countries to help the weakest in society. The alternative would to be to ignore the basic, fundamental rights of people thus deprived of resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would, however, recommend that those Members consult the reports of the United Nations Development Programme, to see that those who contribute the most in terms of cooperation and external solidarity are the ones who also spend the most on internal solidarity within their country. In other words, there is no inherent contradiction between internal solidarity and external solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those who would like the rest of the world to believe that any money of ours that is spent on external solidarity is money wasted in the four corners of the world would therefore be well advised to reread the statistics in the United Nations Human Development Report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I believe that it has become very clear during the debate why we in Parliament want these delegated acts. We do not want micro-management, but we do need to be able to use this instrument in a responsible and well-informed way, so that we can, if necessary, correct what has gone wrong. If we talk about Parliament’s position with external bodies, for example, with human rights organisations which could be affected by this and if we fail to come to an agreement, although I hope that this is not the case, and if individual projects cannot then take place, I believe that there is support and understanding for Parliament’s position. It is not true that Parliament and the concept are not understood.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say something briefly about the criticism that too much money is being spent by Parliament on human rights and the development of democracy. I think that the opposite is the case. If we consider this instrument for human rights and the promotion of democracy, which has only been in existence since 2004, we can see even now that a great deal can be achieved with relatively little money. We cannot simply look at this as a whole. Instead we need to focus in detail on what these projects have achieved. Projects have only had to be discontinued in a few individual cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we really want to see the fundamental values of the EU being put into effect, if we really want people to live in freedom, free from poverty and free from fear, we must promote human rights. This instrument makes a very good complement to our policy for requiring other states to support human rights. We are not spending too much money. On the contrary, we need much clearer financial support.</p>

Mr Brok made it quite clear that we really want to make a distinction between executive and legislative duties. Our aim is not to mix these but, as it has been stated here by both the rapporteurs and my fellow Members, Parliament must have the opportunity to have a say in planning and in strategy to make execution really function effectively and to direct the funds to where they are most needed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to remark with regard to the opinions about the use of the funds in particular that I do not believe that any taxpayer would question the importance of us being able to help or save human lives, the lives of human rights activists, through this financing instrument for defending democratic and human rights, so I believe that this is exactly the instrument which would be accepted by any taxpayer. I take extremely seriously what the Commissioner, too, has said, that Parliament has been assigned new powers and stronger rights after Lisbon. For this reason we would really like the Council and the Commission to show openness so that a good compromise may finally be reached, since we all have an interest in making these instruments work really efficiently, and for this all three institutions are needed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I understand I have some injury time for not being able to get in at the beginning of the debate. My apologies – I got held up in traffic.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, a British colleague has criticised the situation with regard to the importance of democracy and human rights. If democracy and human rights were functioning in our Member States, then we would not have children going to school on bread and jam, and that is the reality of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whether in Britain or in any other Member State, I think it is clearly a matter for those Member States to ensure that does not happen. Let us be very clear about what this is all about: not just democracy and human rights. Twenty-two thousand children die each day, every day, a short plane journey from this building. Twenty-two thousand. The good news is that it used to be 34 000. We and others have brought it down to 22 000 because of democracy and human rights and the sort of financial instruments which the Union has approved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us not pit those people against children in our own Member States going to school on bread and jam, which I deplore also. Let our Member State governments get their act together in dealing with those children.</p>
      <p sl="en">This issue is about implementation or delegated acts. Is it implementation, or is it a delegated act – in which case it is legislation?</p>
      <p sl="en">I propose to stick completely to Parliament’s first reading and thus to say that we will reinstate – have reinstated – all amendments. These have not been accepted by the Council. The issue at stake is one of principle and is crucial to the future nature of interinstitutional relations in the area of external action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The amendments proposed by Parliament do not concern the substance of the DCI or the other instruments, but the role of Parliament in the practical implementation of the law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective is to protect the democratic prerogatives of the European Parliament, as provided for in the Lisbon Treaty. As co-legislator, we must be able to control, on an equal footing with the Council, the adoption and the execution of strategic decisions on the spending of development aid: how much, where and how. In technical terms, the amendments ensure that certain draft decisions taken by the Commission are recognised as delegated acts as defined in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">This would give the two branches of the legislative authority the possibility to object to draft decisions which are not in conformity with the requirements of the law. This veto would ensure that Parliament’s suggestions are taken into account when the Commission programmes EU aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear that we are not talking about micro-management, as a colleague has already said, or individual programmes and projects. The amendments will ensure that legislators keep control over strategic decisions concerning funding allocations and sectoral priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">All proposed amendments were already included in Parliament’s first reading position, which was adopted by plenary with a large majority on 21 October 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Council has flatly rejected all amendments on democratic scrutiny and delegated acts, without proposing any alternative solution which would satisfy Parliament’s demands.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is unfortunate that during the many months – almost one year – that have passed since the first discussion of the dossier in committee, interinstitutional negotiations have not made any progress. I can assure this House that we have really tried very hard. Negotiations with the Council and the Commission – which should incidentally facilitate these negotiations – started in February 2010. We held three dialogues and several meetings at technical level, both on the contentious issues of delegated acts. On these issues, there has been no rapprochement. Only towards the end of last year did the Commission negotiators come up with a compromise proposal. Parliament immediately reacted with a counterproposal, but this was not reflected in the Council’s position. We understand that it was not formally transmitted to the Member States in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the hard line of the Council, which is shared by the Commission – something I regret because it is not its constitutional position to do so – Parliament insists on its position. Legally, our arguments are sound. The strategy papers are multiannual programmes, decided under the DCI for example, which fulfil the criteria for the application of the delegated act procedure. They supplement the basic regulation and are of general application. The criteria mentioned in Article 290 are compulsory if they are fulfilled. The Council and Parliament must have a veto right.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not a matter of political bargaining or any special arrangements, as that would be contrary to the Treaty. It is a legal obligation. Politically, we have the full support of our Conference of Presidents, which decided on two different occasions – most recently earlier this month – that in all dossiers negotiators should insist on the application of the delegated acts procedure for decisions concerning objectives, the choice of priorities, expected results and financial allocations in broad terms.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have a common line among the committees: the rapporteurs in the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs – respectively responsible for instruments for cooperation with industrialised countries and instruments for human rights and democracy – have adopted the very same approach as I have. All amendments concerning delegated acts from first reading should be reinstated. Our position is plain and simple and fully in line with the mandate of the Conference of Presidents. We will not be divided or have our role as a legislature ignored.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that the introduction of the new procedure would also be in the interests of the intended beneficiaries of our financial instruments. Parliament could play its role as watchdog much more effectively and ensure that the money is spent on the core objectives of the Union’s development cooperation defined in the Treaty: the reduction – and ultimately the eradication – of poverty. Twenty-two thousand children do not need to die each day, every day. We demand to have our say on how this issue is addressed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I agree with Mr Deva that we gave up certain of our rights. I was the rapporteur on the Development and Cooperation Instrument. It took us two and a half years to agree that instrument because we simply would not give up on certain core rights of Parliament, but we did have to compromise towards the end.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the end, there was an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council which said that we, through our Committee on Development for example, would have scrutiny rights over the DCI, and we set up groups to carry out that agreement. These instruments are in the spirit of that agreement, which should be continued.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr De Gucht, you are absolutely right that the outside world does not understand why we cannot come to an agreement with the Council. The Council is not even present for this debate, which I very much regret, because that is not a good omen for the completion of the second reading. However, we must ask why a normal principle and a normal right, which are enshrined in the treaty, are not being recognised. I believe, and Mr Brok has discussed this in detail, that this is only about giving us the opportunity to intervene.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps I can give one more example with regard to the content. In the Commission’s multiannual plan for my industrialised countries instrument (ICI), the reference document was not the amended regulation, but instead the Global Europe strategy. This uses language which has become obsolete since the advent of the economic crisis and the resulting trade problems when it says that the objective of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can only repeat that this is not what the legislators intended the instrument to achieve and they have not put aside any taxpayers’ money for this purpose. In our view, the ICI should be a modern cooperation programme and not a weapon of conquest. To give another example, this time in more blunt terms: For us, the countries of south-east Asia are not just junior partners, as the Commission has stated. As part of the cooperation with central Asia, the instrument must not focus solely on EU access to the gas reserves there.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we look at the Maghreb region and the developments in the Middle East, it is clear that we need to take a long-term, large-scale approach to cooperation. I hope that the new regulation will be future-proof. I also hope that this financing instrument will encourage exchanges on an equal footing between the EU and third countries and will help to create openness throughout the world and promote responsible support for sustainable development processes which are in the interests of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European financing instrument for promoting democracy and human rights is one of the EU’s only foreign policy instruments which still maintains a rigid system for allocating funds, due to the fact that it does not offer the opportunity for an exemption from the principle of ineligibility of costs relating to taxes, duties and other charges financed by the EU. In a situation where we are faced with deteriorating protection for human rights worldwide, I believe that it is an absolute necessity for the European Union to reassert its role as a global leader for democracy and fundamental rights. In this respect, it is especially necessary to make the European financing instrument more adaptable to enable the Union and beneficiaries of European financial assistance to enjoy a certain degree of flexibility in managing the projects they undertake. On the other hand, this flexible approach to granting EU funds will be monitored closely to prevent the occurrence of abuses. Apart from the exemption which should remain regarding the approval of the financing of costs relating to duties, taxes and other charges and carried out on a case-by-case basis, the European Parliament must have the right to monitor the activities carried out by the Commission and the strategic documents adopted by it.</p>

      <p sl="en">The recommendation for a second reading on the establishment of a financing instrument for development cooperation, mentions the high level of agreement over the measures, and in principle adopts all of the amendments from the first reading. I personally consider it a priority to resolve the systemic issues relating to the multiannual funding of development assistance, and I agree with the rapporteur that we must sort out the funding method for 2012 and 2013. The recommendation states that the regulation radically reduces spare capacity within the framework of the ceiling for Heading 4 of the multiannual financial framework for the period 2007-2013, and does not leave sufficient room for manoeuvre in respect of addressing and responding to any future crises. The recommendation also addresses legislative issues in the procedural approach of the Council, which Parliament criticises, since Parliament should have the same monitoring powers as the Council when it comes to adopting strategic decisions over the issue of where and how development aid will be spent. In accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, I therefore support the urgent incorporation into the regulation on the instrument for development cooperation of a properly integrated procedure for delegated acts relating to the planning of other external action financing instruments which are currently under review, that is, the stability instrument, the instrument for human rights and democracy and the instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries.</p>

      <p sl="cs">One of the main aims of EU development policy is the reduction and definitive eradication of poverty, to which the proposed EUR 190 million Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) for 2010-2013, approved by the Commission on 17 March 2010, should make a clear contribution. It is also true that in the past, plans in this area were drawn up more from a commercial perspective than from a development perspective, and it is precisely the development perspective that should be reflected in the new proposal. It also seems right to support the BAMs with the aim of improving living standards for people in the ACP countries which supply bananas, and which are affected by the duties levied on bananas imported into the EU. Nevertheless, the Commission’s proposal has certain shortcomings, such as the absence of an impact assessment in respect of the proposed measures, the timing of drawdowns, the questionable large-scale use of EU reserves or the continuing problem of insufficient funding for Heading 4, which the Commission correctly pointed out in its assessment report on the functioning of the interinstitutional agreement. On the whole, I think that the report submitted by Charles Goerens presents an accurate analysis of the issue both from a commercial and a development perspective, reflecting the comments approved by the Committee on Budgets on 13 April 2010, and that it also contains relevant recommendations in the BAM area, and I therefore recommend approving the proposed version.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I understand the Commission’s demand for greater flexibility in the funding of politically sensitive projects aimed at supporting democracy and human rights. However, at the same time, I firmly believe that if this Parliament has to give the Commission a freer hand in financing such projects, it must retain its monitoring role. In the final analysis, it is we who are responsible to the people for the EU budget. If we are talking about financial instruments for supporting the spread of democracy, legal certainty and respect for human beings, we should also be talking about the effectiveness of these instruments, and about whether we might promote democracy and human rights in even more effective ways. In the debate on the persecution of Christians worldwide, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs assured us that every bilateral agreement on cooperation now includes a clause on democracy and human rights. To make any financial assistance or commercial agreement conditional on the fulfilment of these obligations might help to spread democracy and respect for fundamental human rights more than supporting various more and less sensible projects.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Potočnik, firstly I would like to thank all the kind people in this House and in the Commission who have helped me during this phase. The process has not been exactly straightforward. The cooperation with the Commission was excellent and I would like once again to give my sincere thanks to the team in my office who worked around the clock on this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue of electronic waste is not about implementing exaggerated environmental standards. On the one hand, it is true that these are environmental standards, but on the other hand, this also concerns the question of safeguarding our supplies of raw materials in Europe. We all know that in the foreseeable future raw materials will be in short supply. What use are advanced technologies if we no longer have any raw materials?</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we also need to look at this report from an economic perspective and then it unfortunately becomes clear that we are weak in a number of areas. The European countries have varying collection rates. The countries in the north are the best, with a rate of 16 kg per head of population. The worst performer is the country where my name comes from, where only 1 kg per year is collected. With rates of 16 kg and 1 kg, it is important not to keep quiet about those countries with a good record, but we also need to name and shame the poor performers and I intend to do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must finally introduce uniform criteria in this directive, because these have been lacking until now. Every country is doing what it wants and using its own definitions. This is why it is not really possible to bring the countries with such poor collection rates before a court, because they are acting correctly according to their own standards. The situation in the European Union must change, because we are living in an internal market. Sometimes we seem to have forgotten that.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must not give up the huge benefits that the European Union can bring. This is why it is right that this piece of Swiss cheese which is full of holes is finally being transformed into something consisting of more cheese and fewer holes. The Commission is now on the right track, but unfortunately it has neglected to carry out checks in recent years. I would have liked to have seen greater commitment from the Commission in this respect. However, that is in the past and we hope that the future will be better. It really is not easy when the Member States go their own way and even my own country is not exactly biddable.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are right to define the collection targets more clearly. We are right to put a stop to illegal exports. The examples I can give would make your hair stand on end. In a large port in one country, 420 containers containing high-quality electronic waste were checked and 360 of them were illegal. Our children will be asking us very uncomfortable questions, if we cannot finally bring this situation under control. One tonne of circuit boards contains 200 grams of gold, while one tonne of ore contains only 2 grams of gold. We cannot afford to go on in this way in future and I hope that the citizens of Europe will become more aware of these economic issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is why we want a more dedicated collection system. Specifically, we want it to be possible for small appliances, which can easily be thrown into the dustbin, to be handed in free of charge. We can put in place exceptions for very small businesses, but as a general rule we must make it easier to hand in electronic devices, rather than putting them in the dustbin, because we need the valuable raw materials. That is our main goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must also stop illegal shipments and change the scope of the directive. Today, if you manufacture a lamp, you have to register it in all 27 Member States in order to be able to sell it, simply because of the waste directive. The system must be brought up-to-date and made more attractive. We are on the way to achieving this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would also like first to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, and his team, the shadows and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for their hard work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Their commitment and interest in this matter is reflected in the amendments that were adopted in committee and tabled in recent weeks. I am pleased to see that many amendments fully support the objectives of the Commission’s proposals on the directive on waste electronic and electrical equipment, namely: to fully reap the environmental benefits of the WEEE Directive by setting ambitious collection and recovery targets that are realistic for all the Member States; to strengthen implementation and enforcement by establishing detailed rules to fight illegal exports of EU waste; and to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens significantly for European producers through reinforced cooperation among national authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">By strengthening the WEEE Directive we can make an important contribution towards becoming a resource-efficient recycling society. We are talking about the fastest growing waste stream in Europe, and one with huge potential for reducing our dependence on imported or virgin raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="en">Based on this very positive background of broad agreement between Parliament and the Commission, let me make some introductory comments on the three specific issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is pleased that Parliament fully accepts the ambition level and starting date for the new collection target. It is ambitious in order to benefit our environment and increase the resource efficiency of our economy, and it is achievable for each Member State, which is also important. The committee proposes to define the target in a new way by mentioning the ultimate goal – collecting a proportion of the WEEE generated – explicitly in the wording. The Commission can agree to this approach if an appropriate methodology to calculate the WEEE generated is established. The Commission is willing to contribute to coming up with this methodology, as proposed by the committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the scope of the directive, it is proposed that the link between derogations to the WEEE Directive be abolished. This is acceptable to the Commission, because the principle objective of the Commission proposal in this area was to clarify, but not to change, the scope of the WEEE Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, concerning photovoltaic models, which are one specific issue within the matter of the scope of the directive, the Commission proposes to exclude them specifically from the scope of the directive which, as you know, is in line with the committee’s proposal and the current directive. However, we are aware of the increasing number of concerns relating to the potential environmental impact of solar panels, particularly in their waste phase. A voluntary agreement recently submitted by the solar panel industry clearly fails to meet the criteria for such agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">An evaluation of the agreement by the Commission’s services will be published very soon. We clearly need to assess properly the environmental risks and opportunities of the disposal of solar panels before considering their inclusion in the scope of the WEEE directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, as you know, the new WEEE Directive was proposed under the recast procedure, which combines the requalification of existing texts with designated new or amended elements. We still believe that, when the recast procedure is used, we should in principle respect the agreed rules of the procedure. Only those elements have been truly impact-assessed. However, we sympathise with the intentions, and agree with the direction, of certain amendments which were tabled by the committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am now curious to listen to your debate on the proposal and the proposed amendments, and will make further comments, on behalf of the Commission, in my closing remarks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Florenz for his highly pragmatic approach to this subject and for his stamina. I would like to start with a question for Mr Potočnik. You say that we must deal with the Member States in accordance with their ability to collect waste. It is true that the motto of the European Union is ‘United in diversity’ but can it really be right that one Member State collects 16 kg of waste per head and another only 1 kg? Is this not a misinterpretation of diversity?</p>
      <p sl="de">I am calling on you openly to take a stricter approach on waste with the Member States. We are busy adopting regulations here in Parliament while the Member States are doing what they want. This must not happen in future. I would like to remind you about the interview you gave during the waste crisis in Naples. Italy was condemned at the time and there is still no proper plan on the table. You need to be stricter. It is the function of the Commission, in its capacity as the custodian of the treaties, to remind those Member States which are lagging behind about their obligations.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this area, we have a rapidly growing market and the future of Europe will depend on how we manage this waste problem. We need the Member States to implement the regulations properly. If they are too lax in this respect, then we will not be able to make progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would have liked to have asked you to set realistic targets, in particular with regard to the smallest companies, and to include consumers. It is clear that everyone must take on their share of the responsibility. However, we need to remind those responsible, and when it comes to the implementation this is the Member States, what their responsibilities are.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, on the eve of the energy summit and at a time when the Commission and Parliament are placing a great deal of emphasis on energy efficiency and good management of our raw materials, this is the kind of directive which should effectively translate those fine ideas into practice. That is Parliament’s ambition and with that in mind we have worked on our amendments. This is about an ever-growing mountain of waste, but not just about waste. Each of these electronic products contains several materials which we urgently need to recycle and reuse.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is very clear that the first directive has failed to meet that objective. If we consider the fact that only one in three products is recycled or reused and that we do not even know where one in two of such products are to be found, then we have to set higher collection and better recycling targets. Above all, we should ensure that we curb exports of such products to the rest of the world. What we want, in fact, is for such products to remain here and for us to keep the raw materials. In addition, we have major ethical and ecological concerns about the way in which these products are being dealt with in developing countries, in particular.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In other words, Parliament wants clear and very specific targets. I would very explicitly like to thank my fellow members, the shadow rapporteurs and, of course, Mr Florenz, the rapporteur, for their excellent cooperation, thanks to which we have been able to table a coherent text. We are a Parliament that will stand firm in the negotiations with the Council. Council, be warned, because we really want to translate these ideas into practice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, it is extremely important that we put extra emphasis on illegal export and that we also enter the fray on small WEEE. This is extremely important. We have no one dumping large refrigerators by the roadside any more, but our small appliances are not being properly disposed of yet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, I have listened very carefully to what you said about photovoltaic panels. You know that my group has fought long and hard against these being granted a special exemption. We have not discussed photovoltaic panels here, but I will keep you to your word. You have said that you will carry out an evaluation and that that evaluation will form part of the debate with the Council on whether or not photovoltaic panels will be included. In any case, I ask my fellow members to wholeheartedly support the ambitious text before us today.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, Europe pays more than EUR 130 billion every year to import strategic metals to support its industry. This expense can be significantly reduced with the improved text of the European directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, which we adopted by a large majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in the summer.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why I must congratulate the rapporteur Karl-Heinz Florenz and the other rapporteurs for the exceptionally skilful and responsible job they have done. The compromise text, which will be presented to you today to vote on, marks an important step forward in the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment in Europe. Furthermore, thanks to the new, more ambitious specific target and the improved waste collection scheme with clearly highlighted responsibility, Europe can also resolve its important and, I would say, strategic problem. This is because a great deal of the waste electronic and electrical equipment in Europe contains precious metals such as gold, platinum, palladium, copper, nickel and others, which can be extracted and reused many times over. Just to give an example, in 2006, according to Eurostat data, European Union countries dumped almost 307 million tonnes of recyclable waste and equipment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The report marks a significant advance not only in terms of the increased waste collection target, but also in terms of better environmental protection. This is why I call on all fellow Members to support the report in its entirety.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are trying in this endeavour to address the problem of the spiralling increase in waste electrical and electronic equipment, which is forecast to reach 12.3 million tonnes by 2020. The review of the directive is an excellent opportunity to put a stop to leaks of hazardous substances due to the lack of official collection points, irrational management and illegal shipments.</p>
      <p sl="el">The basic problems we have to address are: firstly, the fact that, although 65% of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the market is collected separately, less than half is treated and declared and the rest ends up in the environment or is exported to third countries. Secondly, the current collection quota of four kilos per person per annum for waste generated by households does not reflect consumption in certain Member States and thus results in very low targets in some countries and excessively ambitious targets in others. Thirdly, there are different procedures for registering and recording output in various countries and, finally, commitments are not applied.</p>
      <p sl="el">What we have done is this: firstly, we have broadened the scope to all waste, with just a few exceptions. Secondly, we have increased collection targets for this waste to 85% by 2016. Thirdly, we have set a separate target of 5% for re-use of complete electronic and electrical devices. Fourthly, the Member States must provide adequate resources for collecting waste from households. Fifthly, retailers should not only take this waste back when a new item is purchased; they should also collect very small volume waste.</p>
      <p sl="el">The producer does not have to come from the country in which he wishes to register and, finally, we want close monitoring of shipments. Above all, however, what we need is to encourage the production of long-lasting appliances.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would also like to express my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur for the work that has been done on this. The aims of the directive are clear, and my group is happy to support them in principle. WEEE is the fastest growing waste stream in Europe and we simply have to have an adequate directive to deal with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are of course many details that still need to be dealt with here. Firstly, I want to mention the costs. Recycling, re-use and ultimate disposal are not cheap and not free. The ‘producer-pays’ principle is paramount. We must not impose a system that increases the costs for the general taxpayer, particularly in this era of fiscal consolidation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I want to emphasise the need to maintain flexibility for Member States. Yes, I totally agree: let us set challenging targets, but let us not confuse targets with compliance. Let us not be over-prescriptive in directing how Member States get there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Echoing Ms Van Brempt, I also want to mention needs in relation to small WEEE. This is an area that has been sadly neglected. I think that the proposed ambitious targets will ensure that a larger percentage of smaller WEEE will be collected in the future. I look forward to that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically. Millions of tonnes of electric and electronic waste are produced in the EU every year and this represents a genuine hazard for people and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that the report by Mr Florenz recognises this problem and that we were able to introduce some pleasing improvements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety which had the support of all the groups. The stricter export regulations for electric and electronic waste are important. I hope that you, ladies and gentlemen, will support this regulation which, above all, will help to protect the people in those countries which are affected.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I still do not agree with the exclusion of solar modules from the directive. I take a very critical view of the voluntary collection of items by producers. A few manufacturers use cadmium, which is a toxic substance, in their solar modules. The fact that modules are frequently removed by do-it-yourself enthusiasts presents an additional risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nanomaterials can also be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear instructions stating that they are damaging to health. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. This is why we have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I would like to ask you to support them. These are Amendments 101 and 102.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure under examination contains some critical issues that can only be resolved if they are discussed again at second reading.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition to unacceptable rules to the detriment of distributors and, down the supply chain, consumers, who will be obliged to recover old equipment and assess whether it can be reused, the collection rate is being raised from an already unrealistic 65% right up to 85%. Since waste management is a responsibility of the Member States, how can we force producers and distributors to recover 85%? If consumers dispose of equipment themselves by giving it away or reselling it, how can other people be held responsible for recovering it?</p>
      <p sl="it">The text also lays down the obligation of recovering 5% of waste for reuse. That means going against the environment and consumer safety, because old, high-energy consumption and potentially dangerous equipment would be put back on the market. If the text remains the one adopted in committee and not the one with the amendments included, we will vote against it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, waste electrical and electronic equipment represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the European Union. It is a problem which exists at many levels, because on the one hand it concerns protecting the environment and human health, and on the other it is about the effective management of resources and natural materials.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Revision of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment should give consideration to goals which are not only ambitious, but which are also more realistic from the point of view of the new Member States. In the new Member States, electronic equipment such as computers, televisions and refrigerators is changed much less frequently, and these appliances are used for much longer than in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The amendments tabled by the rapporteur represent a move towards solving the problem of disproportionate methodology and the unfavourable treatment of the European Union’s new Member States. Such a system takes much greater account of market variances and differences in thinking between individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I do think, however, that new regulations in this area should place greater emphasis on effective inspection of collections and the enforcement of legislation. Numerous irregularities occur in many countries, such as the creation of fictitious documentation of waste collections, for example, in a practice known as invoice trading. This is a common situation, in which false documentation is generated to certify the collection and processing of equipment, to overstate the weight of equipment processed, or to issue certification that different equipment was collected than was really the case. In addition, inadequate monitoring and inspection mean that in many countries a grey market is in operation, in which equipment collected is dismantled at sites other than treatment facilities. It is necessary to show determination in the prevention of such situations and not to allow similar practices to develop.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that, where I live, if I want to recycle any of my electrical goods, I have got to take them to a local council site myself. There are about four or five in my city and they are only open at certain times.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I want to recycle cardboard, paper, plastics or glass, these are collected at the kerbside, from my home. If I want to recycle batteries, I can take my old batteries to any retailer. If we want to see the targets increased for waste electrical goods, we have to have more of that kind of collection. We have got to make it easier for the public to dispose of their electrical goods, and particularly small electrical goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the target of four tonnes per person was set, it was totally inadequate. It was met too easily just by people recycling their fridges or their big electrical goods. We need a much more ambitious target in order to drive the market and to make sure that companies are set up which can strip the useful elements out of these goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, Commissioner, you launched your resource efficiency strategy. This directive is part and parcel of that. It should be the norm that every item of electrical waste is collected and most of it recycled, not the exception. Unfortunately, in Europe, today it is the exception. Tomorrow it has got to be the rule. I am afraid we will never succeed in your long-term strategy of resource efficiency – tackling the problems Karl-Heinz has raised about the lack of raw materials – unless this directive works.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, [opening words lost as microphone switched off] … a recast directive but quite a few of us here worked on the original cast, and it is a good opportunity to close some of the loopholes and put in place the directive we always thought merited our attention. But because we want to ensure that we are properly recycling electrical goods, we want to close the loophole which is leading to so many electrical goods ending up in developing nations, being taken apart by children on bonfires and dumps.</p>
      <p sl="en">To those manufacturers and producers who are writing to us now asking us not to support one or other amendment that aims to close these loopholes, I would say: let them come up with their suggestions. It is their products which are ending up in these dumps and they have to come forward with proposals to make sure it does not happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">This also gives us a chance to finish some uncompleted business. Printer companies have a business model based on selling their printers relatively cheaply and getting their customers locked into a contract to keep buying expensive printer cartridges. They have a constant war with the remanufacturers, who take these printer cartridges and refill them with ink and sell them back to you for a fraction of the price.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nearly 10 years ago we discovered that the printer manufacturers had hit upon a new means of advancing that war by using electronics to stop the printer cartridges being recycled: you fill them with ink and they stop working. So we inserted into the legislation Article 4 designed to ensure that you cannot place on the market products which cannot be recycled.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the printer companies found a way around that. They lobbied one government after another and they said that printer cartridges can be regarded as consumables, not as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). So we are left now with a position where printer cartridges in some Member States are regarded as WEEE, in some others not.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the chance to close that loophole to make sure that we have more competition on the market and to encourage proper recycling. I look for the support of colleagues for those amendments.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, it is beyond doubt that this directive marks a step in the right direction, as it tries to change the quantitative collection targets, to establish rules for the cross-border transportation of electrical and electronic equipment, and to harmonise the administrative steps applying to mandatory subjects in order to reduce bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is because of the excessive bureaucracy that I reject product definition at the EU level, even with regard to the possible enforcement of stipulated obligations by Member States. In this case, we should be guided by the principle of ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As far as the scope of the directive is concerned, I personally prefer a limited scope, because I am concerned that an open scope would include equipment that cannot feasibly be recycled or equipment with a long working life, thereby putting at risk the fulfilment of the agreed collection targets. In this case, I take the view that we should not only be ambitious in setting targets, but above all realistic, and we should not place a greater burden on local authorities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">At a time when Europe is considering a common strategy for its supply of raw materials and especially rare earths, we cannot overlook the huge potential that the intelligent recovery of our waste offers. Strengthening European standards so as to improve the functioning of the collection chain, solving problems relating to the leakage and illegal export of WEEE, and setting more ambitious collection targets: that is what should be at the heart of this legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not forget who is chiefly responsible for the success or failure of this legislation: the consumer. Empowering the public is crucial if we want to implement effective legislation. To this end, Mr Florenz, the eco-contribution, among other systems, has proved to be a very important tool. Of course, electrical and electronic equipment producers must become more involved in the collection and recycling system, but we cannot absolve the citizens of all responsibility for the waste they produce. Our citizens must become actors and not spectators in European environmental policy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with much of what I have heard. I think this is an important, fundamental directive, and so we will of course vote for it. I am also convinced, however, that we need more detail on certain aspects and I hope that will be possible at second reading.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, I expect the Commission to carry out an impact assessment concerning the open scope of the directive because, although in theory it might appear to respect the environment more, I think it could give rise to problems at a practical level. Based on experience with the current directive, a closed scope gives greater certainty and makes the legislation easier to implement.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are other aspects as well, in addition to this impact assessment. I think we have to be careful to ease the burden for producers, distributors and retailers. It is right that they should be involved and made to accept responsibility, but we must be careful not to overburden them, not least in terms of administrative requirements.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think the instruments and criteria need to be adjusted to take the various national systems into account. Member States are not just good or bad. As we have heard and as we have already appraised – although I think we need to go into this area as well in greater depth – there are different systems and different circumstances in the Member States, which need to be carefully assessed so that no countries automatically benefit while others automatically lose out. We are therefore in favour of this directive, but we need more time and greater detail.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the Commission has quite rightly produced both a resource efficiency agenda and a raw materials strategy, because raw materials and their use are becoming ever more limited, and at the same time their prices are rising.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We know that a regrettably large proportion of electronic waste, and, in particular, small waste items, such as mobile phones, have ended up in landfill, not just in the EU but also in third countries, and is ultimately incinerated. That is why this important tool is a good step in the right direction in the recycling of electronic waste, allowing us to guarantee better resource efficiency and the return of raw materials to producers.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Hopefully, in future we could progress towards a better system of reporting, with reference to this directive, so that we might actually know how well the different Member States and actors are implementing its aims. We need to give a guarantee of separate collection which is even better than the one proposed and set better and more ambitious targets for it.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, my apologies for hesitating. I would like to thank Mr Florenz for his excellent professional work. Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) belongs to the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. We must do all we can to ensure its proper recycling not only to be able to prevent damage to the environment and health, but also to reduce the loss of raw materials. Based on the results of current impact assessments, 85% of WEEE is now collected but only 33% of this is treated properly in accordance with the requirements of the directive. Unfortunately, the outbound illegal shipment of waste from the European Union is large-scale, and for this reason it is important that the new directive be able to prevent this. Waste must be collected separately because this is how we can ensure that it is retained and sent for recycling within the Member State. Regrettably, experience to date has shown that Member States have not interpreted the current directive uniformly, and so I would like to suggest that in the future the guiding principle should not be classification into different categories but the directive should cover basically all electrical and electronic waste. I believe that the legislation is particularly important for the countries which acceded most recently as they still lag behind in the area of separate waste collection.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, we really do live in a wasteful society if we regard this as waste. Much of this scrap contains higher levels of gold and silver than is contained in the ore in a gold or silver mine. It is not a question of the cost of dealing with this. It is a question of pure profit. It will reduce our dependence on imports of important commodities and we will not be releasing heavy metals and other toxic substances into the environment.

We also need to vote in favour of the amendments that contain requirements for better checks on nanowaste.

Of course, in Latvia we should like a somewhat smaller chance to make the targets: 45% by 2016 and 65% by 2020.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the amendment of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment has gone through an extensive consultation process in the relevant European Parliament committees. The text drawn up by the Commission has gradually been modified through the amendment proposals of the MEPs, and the current compromise version again places the problem of electronic waste collection further to the fore.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The version of Article 47 proposed by the Committee on the Environment is, in my opinion, a particularly beneficial amendment, because it enables the financial obligations of industry to be directed towards developing an electrical waste collection system, rather than implementing penalties for failing to achieve set objectives for collection. This may be particularly beneficial and useful in countries that have yet to create a sufficient infrastructure for collecting electrical waste.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would also like to support the new Article 93, which responds to the fact that many liable persons, particularly internet retailers, are avoiding fulfilling their obligations. The new regulation attempts to deal with this problem in a sensitive and proper manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, many honourable Members of this Parliament mentioned implementation, which is truly a problem. Unfortunately, it is not a problem in this area only, but a problem across the whole environmental spectrum. To be precise, I know my Treaty duty, and I intend to do it to the full.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also preparing a communication on implementation later this year, which would deal with the question of implementation in a more holistic way. We are already discussing it thoroughly together with the directorate, because I believe that this is one of the questions on which we should focus in the future, including, of course, in the proposals which we are discussing today. By the way, the recast proposal certainly facilitates implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the targets. It is of fundamental importance that we have ambitious targets. Many of you mentioned that this is the fastest-growing waste stream. Many of you mentioned that we are living in a world of electric and electronic devices, and this is something we certainly have to take into account when deciding on targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, costs. Whenever we propose any proposal, we also have to take into account the burden of the costs and make things as simple as possible. However, I want to be clear that the real cost to our society and our economy would come if we were not to deal with these questions. That would be the real cost, to which in the longer term we would not be able to respond.</p>
      <p sl="en">We published 14 days ago the so-called waste report. That very day I also visited Unicor, which is one of the hi-tech companies that recycle electrical and electronic waste. I was struck by what I learned and saw there. It is extremely important that we understand that, for example, the mobile phones we hold in our hands in our daily lives, actually contain precious materials, from gold to platinum to rhodium, which are extremely important for the future. If we continue now and always to extract raw materials, we will never see the end of things. I held in my hands 20 kilos of gold produced from mobile phones. It was very difficult to lift, but to be honest it was even more difficult to leave it!</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you mentioned the most important term to be addressed in this context, and that is resource efficiency. I have already mentioned this fact many times, but it is extremely important that we never forget it. According to UN data, in the 20th century the growth of our human population was four times, our output growth was 40 times, CO2 emissions 17 times, energy consumption 16 times, fish catches 35 times and water consumption 9 times. If anybody thinks it can continue like that in the 21st century then they are simply terribly mistaken.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to do things differently. That is why, as I mentioned, now that we are living in an ever more electric and electronic world, the proposal which is on the table today and which you will debate later, is extremely important for dealing with these questions. Many of you also mentioned better reporting and better sorting. All of this should be given our attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion I would just like to say that, after the first reading, I believe we have a good product, worthy to be worked on at second reading and finalised into something that I am sure will be even better.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Potočnik, I support the final remarks that you made, in particular with regard to resource efficiency. However, over the next few months the focus of the entire decision-making process will be on you, because a common position will now have to be agreed on. You will have to negotiate with the Council and come to a decision and I must say to you that the Council has not moved one millimetre over the last seven months, and that was not the fault of the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some countries are very obstinate and, against the background of the unanimity in this House, I would like to ask the Members who have spoken so passionately today in favour of this report to go home and exert some influence on their governments and to explain that things will not be the same as they have been in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">I could mention the names of a few old friends who would really come to grips with this issue. Therefore, Mr Potočnik, I believe that we will need to have an intense debate over the next few months. You must continue to be tough with the Council. It is also important to point out that there is a clear desire for national regulations when it comes to waste policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, that is counterproductive, because the internal market was born a long time ago and we now need to bring it up properly. It is not the entire internal market, but half of the internal market which is the problem. I would like to highlight once again that the ratio of 16 kg to 1 kg, as Mr Seeber has clearly stated, shows that we still have a great deal to do. However, if we can agree on this, then we will be on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Potočnik, I have no doubt that you know what you have to do. I would like to emphasise the fact that you are doing an excellent job and we will continue to give you an occasional nudge, perhaps a little roughly, in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The collection of electrical and electronic waste is a very topical issue at present. It is therefore highly necessary to update the directive covering this area. In my opinion, some of the amendments that will be voted on in the introductory block represent a very poor way of combining Commission proposals with the other proposals for facilitating the collection, sorting and recycling of the waste. On the contrary, even if they do not bring chaos to this issue, they do bring less light. Unfortunately, there is not much we can do at this stage of the issue in the final vote. It is interesting that the representatives of most political groups agree on many of the relatively decent amendments. If this agreement translates into support in the final vote, the resulting directive may support a dramatic increase in the collection of electrical and electronic equipment, as well as equipment that is easier to process. One of the key points is Article 14, paragraph 1, which – as long as Amendment 91 or the rather less clear formulation of Amendment 103 is adopted – could support the recycling and collection of electrical and electronic equipment. It is important for the overall effort to result in a directive that will clearly set out the obligations of the various bodies, while at the same time enabling the recycling process to be as effective as possible. From this perspective, the bizarre idea of sorting lighting equipment into several categories is not desirable, nor is the excessive number of exemptions for the entire category of large equipment.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Waste electrical and electronic equipment is the fastest growing source of waste. It currently represents a significantly higher risk to the environment and public health than spent nuclear fuel. It was essential to revise the directive. A large amount of electronic waste is either not being processed in accordance with the current version, and ends up in dumps, or is illegally exported out of the EU. It is worrying that we have no idea what is happening to more than half of European electrical and electronic waste. This situation is unsustainable, since annual per capita waste output may rise from 4 kg today to 24 kg by 2020, unless collection and recycling targets are stipulated and complied with. The recycling of electronic waste can return more gold to the manufacturing process than is mined in the EU, and the same applies for other precious raw materials. I therefore unequivocally welcome the creation of new permanent jobs and particularly the reduction in the EU’s dependence on imported precious raw materials. Nevertheless, I take a very dim view of the exemption for solar panels. In connection with the exemption for cadmium-telluride panels from the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, it represents a further increase in the risk of environmental pollution by highly toxic cadmium, which the EU is combating in other legislative measures. There are lobbying interests behind this inconsistency, which does not reflect well either on the EU or on the European Parliament, and will consequently be of no benefit to European industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support today’s WEEE report, but we must ensure that we do not place overly-burdensome regulations on already struggling SMEs and retailers. We must ensure that the burden to take back WEEE rests with the manufactures, not the retailers. I welcome the proposal of stronger provisions which seek to prevent illegal shipments of this waste and to close loopholes in the law. Currently, by declaring such equipment as ‘used but functional EEE’ and not WEEE, it can be illegally shipped to, and dumped in, third world countries. Of course, greater enforcement on behalf of authorities is also crucial, while electrical items should be recycled in accordance with the law in order to prevent the uncontrolled release of CFCs. Criminals often profit from illegal shipments, as traffickers involved in the scam often trick authorities by not labelling goods as electronics, by pretending they are for re-use, or by hiding them in the middle of a container for shipment. Unchecked shipments usually end up in Ghana, Nigeria, India or Pakistan. We need to work together on the second reading to ensure that this dangerous practice is stopped, and also to ensure that valuable European metals remain in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU. The proper management of WEEE contributes to the re-use of some valuable resources, which has a particular impact on the environment, citizens’ health and the creation of green jobs. According to the Commission’s impact assessment, approximately 24 kg of WEEE/inhabitant/year are generated at the moment at EU level, only 65% of which is collected. Recycling WEEE will help create 5-7 times more jobs than in the incineration sector and 10 times more than in the storage sector. The revision of the directive has helped set new targets for collecting, recycling and re-using WEEE (recycling target of 50-75% – depending on the categories, which now number six instead of the initial 10 – and a new re-use target of 5%). It has also helped devise tougher measures for preventing the export of electronic waste to developing countries. The responsibilities of manufacturers, consumers and local authorities are defined more clearly to ensure environmentally friendly treatment. Electronic goods manufacturers will have to provide the funding for waste treatment, with a positive upshot in the form of compliance with ecodesign rules, thereby creating products which are easy to repair and recycle.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I believe that the proper disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is exceptionally important. Increasing the rate of separately collected waste is indispensable but it is important that the entire recycling process be monitored through appropriate documentation. Industry’s responsible attitude is also required for this; the conduct of large manufacturing and processing companies must be controlled more efficiently. At the same time, it must be understood that Member States, mainly the newly acceded Member States, do not yet have an appropriate number of recycling facilities, and thus emphasis must be laid on developing these to guarantee that the WEEE collected is indeed treated properly.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The current recast of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment is not only immensely important from the aspect of environmental protection and public health, but also from the point of view of resource efficiency, so frequently mentioned nowadays. It is common knowledge that numerous illegal WEEE shipments leave the European Union year after year, and so it is in the fundamental interest of our industry to ensure that Member States retain valuable raw materials within the borders of the European Union through the proper collection of WEEE, which is generated in increasing quantities, and, if possible, its recycling. Naturally, consumer habits vary from one country to another, and thus in the interest of successful collection this should not be overlooked when setting targets. In Hungary, for instance, the average consumer will not change his television within two or three years, and even if he did, he would be most likely to take it to his weekend house and not to the collection points. In view of all this, the rapporteur, having recognised this problem, managed to secure the acceptance of a broadly supported compromise which determined the basis of the collection targets not by the quantity of products placed on the market but by the quantity of electronic waste generated. Although numerous professional details still need to be worked out in this area, I believe this may be a good direction. This is especially so because in a contradictory manner even the Commission’s impact assessment itself considers the original collection target realistic for the old Member States and not for the new ones.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The proposal for a directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, in the form submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament, is unclear. This is why Member States can apply different interpretations to the types of equipment covered by this directive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, the Commission will have to establish a common methodology for determining the amount of waste generated in each Member State. However, the amount of waste generated depends on the specific features of the consumption market, products’ different life cycles and the habits of the population in each state.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A reporting interval has not been stipulated either for calculating the amount of waste generated as a percentage. The added value offered by this directive lies in the potential health and environmental benefit. Proper management of electronic waste could help achieve a recycling rate of up to 50-75% and a re-use rate of 5%. Both electronic goods manufacturers and consumers need to assume their responsibilities in order to meet this target. Manufacturers will have to provide the funding for waste treatment, while consumers will have to dispose of electronic waste legally at treatment centres.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote that you are going to cast with the utmost responsibility is a very important one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a case of choosing the chairpersons of the three supervisory authorities – for banking, insurance and markets – and hence of getting these three new authorities up and running. Together with the System Risk Board, they will at last constitute the first real European financial markets supervisory architecture, and they owe you a great deal, since it was thanks to a vote by this House that the authorities were created and their powers strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are going to cast this vote with the utmost responsibility, and we shall respect your decision. As it was my responsibility within the Commission, I undertook the job of selecting the candidates from the 275 people who applied, whom I did not choose. They were people from the Member States and the regulatory authorities who freely submitted applications. It was an open and transparent process in which anyone could participate if they so wished.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the end of this process, I personally met the people pre-selected. I have to say, Mr Schmidt, that I myself regretted the fact that, for one of the three posts – the European Banking Authority post – one of the two people pre-selected, a high-calibre female applicant, withdrew at the last minute, just before Christmas. The first commitment that I wish to make is to ensure that the ongoing process of appointing the executive directors – just this morning, I met the candidates pre-selected for one of the authorities – is more balanced and that there is greater diversity of representation, especially from the point of view of gender equality, which is a legitimate demand of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We selected these candidates on the basis of their skills, expertise, commitment to Europe and independence. I shall do the same thing when it comes to the executive directors, so that these three authorities have the credibility and the authority required.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this vote is important. In a letter sent to Mrs Bowles and Mr Lehne yesterday, I pledged – and I confirmed that pledge to you this morning with Vice-President Šefčovič – that we would give these three authorities the practical, financial and human resources necessary to ensure that they have the credibility and independence they require, and I understand that the Presidency has pledged the same things.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These three authorities have a heavy workload ahead of them, with regard to the stress tests, credit rating agencies and the texts that you are discussing at the moment concerning the regulation of derivatives and short selling. There is no shortage of work. We know that the markets move at a much faster pace than democracy. I have confidence in Parliament as it prepares to vote, and I confirm the commitments made by the Commission to ensure the independence, practical resources and credibility of these three new authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Concerning the appointment procedure, we have all discovered we are bound by regulations in ways that all sides realise is inappropriate, such as the retirement age criteria projected to the end of the term of office and also on the gender issue. These will be addressed in the review, with which the Commission and the Presidency also both agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">The committee continues to insist on a role in the ongoing and future shortlisting procedures for all positions, such as that of executive director.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, in order to go further along the road on which we set out in 2006, to make the European Union’s external assistance more effective and transparent, we could not fail to eliminate the inconsistencies that have emerged regarding exceptions to the principle of non-eligibility for Union financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges.</p>
      <p sl="it">The amendment to the regulation is, in that sense, necessary and timely.

      <p sl="fi">the banana war that almost become larger than life, that it is excellent that it has come to an end. It is quite true that we cannot allow universal rules on trade to be broken.

On the other hand, since 1993 the countries in the import regime have enjoyed an immense advantage and in that time have had the chance to sort themselves out and develop their own banana production. This means that they are also better able to cope in the midst of genuine competition and are not merely reliant on special aid.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the trade dispute involving bananas has been one of the longest-running and perhaps the most difficult in the history of the WTO and it is a dispute where the European Union has been squarely and unequivocally in the wrong. Its policy has been to favour producers in some former colonies at the expense of the principles of free trade which are, of course, enshrined notionally in the Treaty of Rome.</p>
      <p sl="en">This policy has been bad for everyone. It has been bad for consumers in Europe, who have had to pay much higher prices, it has been bad for exporters, it has been bad for international harmony and the community of nations, and it has been bad for the people it was notionally designed to protect. The former British and French dependencies have now become dependencies in the fullest sense, tied to an artificial and unproductive export when they might have diversified their economies and integrated more widely into the world economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say one more thing about this which has not come up in any of the debates. The EU has disgracefully been applying pressure on banana producers to form political and economic unions around themselves, in mimicry of the EU model, which is truly none of our business. The whole point of free trade is to swap on the basis of differences, not to sell each other bananas and indeed, for that matter, not to have an artificial customs union among the industrialised economies of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, when negotiating the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment in the European Parliament, a number changes were introduced which improve the directive. I voted in favour of the amended version of this important directive. The directive allows producers of electrical equipment to provide buyers who are purchasing equipment with information on the costs for collecting, processing and disposing of the waste in an environmentally-friendly way.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It increases market transparency by providing information to the relevant bodies, distributors, exporters or customers. It will boost levels of awareness and acceptance of recycling and the refunding of costs. It is important for the financial obligations of industry to be concentrated on developing an effective electrical waste collection system, and not on the payment of penalties for failing to achieve set objectives for collection, where there is insufficiently developed infrastructure for waste collection in a given region.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the dynamic development and technological progress of the countries of Europe is also, unfortunately, accompanied by less desirable consequences. The huge growth in electronic waste is the most visible example of this. We make systematic use of every possible kind of electronic appliance, and we replace them ever more quickly with new ones, but we do not worry about the need to make the old ones safe. This cannot but have an effect on the natural environment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that the revision of legislation on the collection and processing of e-waste will make it possible to achieve an increase in the amounts of valuable materials recovered, because as well as environmental benefits this will also bring economic ones. The high separate collection rate recommended by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety should result in the retention of these materials and their preparation for re-use.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree that it is imperative to curb the illegal export of e-waste outside the European Union. I also expect a reduction in the practice of storing waste from one Member State in the territory of another, something which is not always in accordance with regulations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, waste does not respect borders and that applies in particular to electronic and electrical waste.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, waste electrical and electronic equipment is rapidly increasing in the European Union and the inefficient disposal and unprofessional collection of the waste represent a serious problem for the environment and human health, as well as a loss of raw materials and resources which are not in unlimited supply.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In light of the new information acquired in the application of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, it appears necessary to make suitable amendments to some parts of this legal measure that have so far caused considerable problems with application in practice. I therefore agree with the provisions leading producers and consumers to take more responsibility for the proper disposal of such equipment.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, as far as the current objective is concerned, I would like to say that this objective fails to take account of the very different economic conditions in the various Member States. In my opinion, a percentage share based on market volumes over a certain period of time would be a better way of taking into account the particular circumstances of the Member States and their specific situation on the electrical goods market.</p>

      <p sl="es">This very week I have prepared several questions, to both the Council and the Commission, so that they will investigate whether some companies really make a considered decision about this and whether, therefore, the volume of electronic waste produced at European and at global level could be prevented by combating this type of practice.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr Florenz’s report on the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment, on which we are voting today, is important not only for the future of environmental sustainability in Europe, but also for another aspect: the loss of raw materials. In fact, the efficient and innovative use of materials and resources is a key issue in the globalised economy.

Specific measures are needed on our part in the form of the provision of food, medicine and aid workers. This is needed now. At the same time, of course, we must help to build democratic societies that have legal certainty in Tunisia and Europe. Half of the Member States in our Union have gone from dictatorships to democracy and freedom. What is so difficult about saying that the same should be the case for people in the Middle East?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the uprising by the younger generations that is shaking Tunisia may have significant repercussions on the European Union itself. There are many good reasons for that, including the formulation of the new European Union-Tunisia Action Plan for the period 2011-2016 and, most of all, the regulation of migrant flows.</p>
      <p sl="it">Just a month ago, this very House adopted an important measure – the first legislative dossier under the Treaty of Lisbon – on trafficking in human beings. Any upsurge in the flow of illegal migrants must be decisively countered. To that end we need a European agreement covering the southern shores of the Mediterranean, including Tunisia and also Egypt. To achieve that, the delegation has to go and monitor this process of full democratisation, as indeed it has gone to Tunisia today, but at the same time we need to give Tunisia a real chance through constant, ongoing support for full democracy.</p>

In adding my voice to the appeal of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Buzek, I too call for all steps to be taken to ensure the conduct of fully democratic elections in Tunisia and to bring about the formation of a government of national unity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also support the call of the parliamentary delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries for an independent investigation to be carried out to determine how far those who govern Tunisia are responsible for the use of violence and for the bloodshed. Cooperation and the development of mutual and equal relations with Tunisia lie in the interests both of the citizens of Europe and of Tunisians.

      <p sl="ro">The unanimous vote on the request for waiver of the immunity of Hungarian MEP Tamás Deutsch highlights the benefit of the protection guaranteed at EU level to all members of the legislative. The reason for this, as emerged from the in-depth examination we carried out of the request submitted by the Hungarian judicial authorities, is that we are obviously dealing with the most clear-cut case of immunity concerning political views. Granting immunity to members of a legislative body, an instrument which has been disputed on countless occasions, is intended to give them the freedom to express their opinions. Indeed, the case involving Tamás Deutsch demonstrates its direct benefit. I would remind you that the European Parliament has never protected any of its members if acts of corruption or common law offences were being investigated. The very attempt to prevent MEPs from expressing their opinions on matters of public interest and concern by instituting legal proceedings is unacceptable in a democratic society. Not to mention that it is a breach of Article 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union, which was devised to protect the freedom of expression of MEPs directly involved in carrying out their duties.</p>

The use of legal proceedings to attempt to prevent Members of this House from expressing their opinions on matters of legitimate public interest is not compatible with democracy.

I do not believe that a simple complaint, where the person is accused of making what are seen as defamatory public statements, is reason enough to request the waiver of parliamentary immunity. The rules on immunity also show that the accusations made against Tamás Deutsch refer to opinions expressed in the course of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament. Therefore, Mr Deutsch was performing his duties as an MEP by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his electorate. One should not try to prevent MEPs from expressing their opinions on matters of legitimate public interest, and that is why I voted in favour of Mr Speroni’s report against the waiver of Tamás Deutsch’s immunity.</p>

The main ACP banana-exporting countries may face challenges in the context of changing trade arrangements, notably liberalisation of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff in the framework of the World Trade Organisation and the bilateral and regional agreements concluded, or in the process of being concluded, between the Union and Latin American countries. The financial assistance measures to be adopted under the programme should aim at improving the living standards and living conditions of people in banana-growing areas and in banana value chains, specifically small farmers and small entities, as well as ensuring compliance with labour and occupational health and safety standards, and environmental standards, notably those regarding the use of and exposure to pesticides. The measures should therefore also support the adaptation, including, when relevant, the reorganisation, of areas dependent upon banana exports through sector-specific budget support or project-specific interventions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I welcome the EU’s commitment to supporting the efforts of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to achieve sustainable economic and social development. By integrating a trade dimension into development strategies and by promoting international trade, the EU has made a significant contribution to reducing and eradicating poverty in these countries. It is important to promote the economic diversification of these regions and make them more competitive, whilst taking into account these countries’ policies and adaptation strategies, as well as their regional environment. It is essential to support ACP countries’ adjustment to the liberalisation of the Union’s market within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.

The refusal of the Council to grant Parliament its proper role in implementing the financing instruments according to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union does not appear legitimate to me. The iron hand that the Council insists on maintaining by not applying the solution of delegated acts is blocking various important legislative processes. Parliament must be kept informed responsibly in order to be able to decide responsibly as well. In the case of delegated acts, it must keep intact its powers to revoke that delegation. To give a blank cheque to the other institutions while excluding Parliament is to withdraw this institution’s supervision of the allocation of resources and sectoral priorities in connection with development cooperation.</p>

One year on since the interinstitutional negotiations were initiated on the horizontal issue of delegated acts within the scope of external action financial instruments, the Council has officially refused to grant Parliament its proper role in the operation of the financing instruments, including for development cooperation, as stipulated in Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon. After rejecting all the amendments from first reading attempting to introduce delegated acts into the instruments, without proposing any alternative procedure, the Council called for Parliament to adopt its position without leaving any scope for negotiations. These negotiations are intended primarily to ensure respect for the Treaty of Lisbon by all institutions and not only effective parliamentary control and, therefore, democratic control over the implementation of EU legislation. Indeed, the outcome of the negotiations will establish an important precedent for future legislative negotiations on all financing instruments.

      <p sl="pt">The question of delegated acts has dominated the discussion around the financing instrument for development cooperation, as in fact has happened with other financing instruments. In this case, well-founded concerns have been expressed here, which we share, about a possible delay in the transfer of the funds foreseen in the banana accompanying measures as a result of the current dispute between Parliament and the Council. Without detracting from the importance of this discussion, nevertheless it would also be good to look at the underlying questions arising from the agreement for the liberalisation of the banana trade signed by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We need to remember here that the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, which will be significantly affected by this agreement and were not duly involved in its discussion, estimate the amount of aid necessary to maintain their banana sector at EUR 500 million. Therefore, the amount proposed by the Commission, EUR 190 million, is well below the estimated impact of this agreement. On the African continent alone, approximately 500 000 people depend on the banana sector for their living. The sector is regarded as a focus of sustainable development that has made it possible to install health, water, energy and housing infrastructure. Free trade, to which this agreement opens the gates, will now put all that in jeopardy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The European Union is the world’s biggest donor of development aid. We provide more than 50% of total global aid, thus providing an example for other regions and countries to emulate. Development cooperation represents a very important part of EU external relations. It is the most important instrument reducing poverty in developing countries, and developing the economies of the poorest nations, as well as social policies, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. If it is implemented even more effectively, development aid offers hope that we may overcome the division of the world into ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ countries. I voted in favour of this recommendation, because I am in favour of the call for the European Commission to prepare a compromise proposal, on how to include the European Parliament in the control of the Instrument for Development Cooperation following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.

      <p sl="lt">Democracy is not just free and fair elections. In order for there to be a democratic society, it is necessary to support and defend human rights. The EU has often rushed to be the first to condemn human rights violations outside the EU, such as when it approved the application of sanctions against President Lukashenko’s regime on Monday, or when it criticised human rights violations in Egypt and Tunisia. However, when attention turns to human rights violations within the EU, we are slow to react. This only weakens the EU’s position. The EU’s external financial instruments, such as the Instrument for Development Cooperation, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the Instrument for Stability have great potential. However, the EU should focus attention on strengthening the rule of law within its borders, as well as increasing transparency and accountability in public services. I believe that democratisation and the election process are also important for poverty reduction, sustainable development, peace and stability. If we fail to ensure human rights and democracy, then we risk losing far more. It is important for the EU to have a good reputation in the field of human rights if it wants to take full advantage of its financial instruments for external action.</p>

The refusal of the Council to grant Parliament its proper role in implementing the financing instruments according to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union does not appear legitimate to me. The iron hand that the Council insists on maintaining by not applying the solution of the delegated acts is blocking various important legislative processes. Parliament must be kept informed responsibly in order to be able to decide responsibly as well. In the case of delegated acts, it must keep intact its powers to revoke that delegation. To give a blank cheque to the other institutions while excluding Parliament is to withdraw this institution’s supervision of the allocation of resources and sectoral priorities in connection with development cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Council has shown its reluctance to accept that the procedure under Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union applies to the instruments in question.

      <p sl="pt">At this second reading, the discussion has been dominated by the possibility of delegating to the Commission the adoption of non-legislative acts that supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act, in other words, what are known as ‘delegated acts’. The speeding up of a certain type of procedures that guarantee that indispensable aid to developing countries reaches its destination in good time is certainly a concern that needs to be taken into account. Another concern is the guarantee that the Commission acts within the strict limits of the delegation attributed to it (which, according to the terms provided, can be revoked), without exceeding its competences, and the guarantee that the competences of Parliament and of the Council are therefore duly safeguarded.</p>
      <p sl="pt">More is at stake in the discussion on the financing instrument for development cooperation, however, than just the matter of delegated acts. To be more specific, this subject requires us to reflect on a fundamental question: the direction impressed on the EU’s cooperation policy.

      <p sl="pt">Therefore, I consider it to be extremely important that this financing instrument supports civil organisations, states and private individuals without the prior approval of the national governments being necessary. In view of the limitation of the budget destined for the EIDHR, it must only be applied to initiatives that promote human rights and democracy. However, I regret having to point out the Council’s refusal to apply Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which delegates to the Commission ‘the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act’. The introduction of the regulatory procedure with control over strategy documents and multiannual cooperation programmes within the framework of the EIDHR would give the European Parliament greater power in this respect, as enshrined in the TFEU.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission proposal includes no less than four separate financing instruments. They are aimed at different market sectors. For each one of them there are justifications that sound credible. However, taken together they are all aimed at the same thing. The intention is to advance and promote the political and foreign policy agenda of the European Commission. Even Trade Commissioner Mr De Gucht in the debate admits ‘ … they do support a whole range of EU policy objectives including trade, and allow us to remain relevant as foreign policy actors’. And we know by now who is paying for all of this. The hard-pressed taxpayer and obviously and as usual the British taxpayer – disproportionately. The cost of all this, despite our best efforts, is unknown. Once again the Commission are being profligate and irresponsible with other people’s money.

The primary objective of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 is the eradication of poverty through the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. The scope of cooperation for the geographic programmes with developing countries and regions established under that Regulation is furthermore limited materially to financing measures designed to fulfil the criteria for Official Development Assistance (‘ODA criteria’) established by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (‘OECD/DAC’). It is in the European Union's interests to further deepen its relations with the developing countries concerned, which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral fora and in global governance. The Union has a strategic interest in promoting diversified links with those countries, in particular in areas such as economic, commercial, academic, business and scientific exchanges. It therefore needs a financial instrument that allows the financing of such measures which, in principle, do not qualify as ODA under the ODA criteria, but which are crucially important in terms of consolidating relations and which make an important contribution to promoting the progress of the developing countries concerned. The Union's cooperation should take into consideration efforts made by the recipient countries to comply with the International Labour Organisation international agreements and to participate in the general objectives of greenhouse gas emissions reduction.</p>

      <p sl="it">The aim of the proposal, which fits into the broader context of interinstitutional negotiations on the use of delegated acts for the financing of the Union’s external action, is in fact to protect Parliament’s prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, while also ensuring effective control over the implementation of EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council has shown its reluctance to accept that the procedure under Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union applies to the instruments in question. That not only demonstrates the Council’s unjustifiable refusal to grant Parliament its due role as co-legislator in making strategic decisions on the management of financing instruments, but also ends up legitimising an unacceptable democratic deficit in the implementation of EU legislation. This refusal by the Council goes against the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore believe that it is crucial to insist that the proposed amendments are accepted, for reasons of legal as well as political expediency, in order to strengthen Parliament’s role and ensure that it is placed on an equal footing with the Council in terms of respecting each other’s powers and the legislative changes introduced by the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Knowing that the principal general objective of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 is to eradicate poverty through the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, cooperation is essentially limited to the financing of measures aimed at satisfying the criteria applicable to public development aid as established.

On the contrary, governments have been made dependent on aid and, what is even worse, millions of euros of development aid often disappear because of corruption or are siphoned off into the bank accounts of third-world dictators. As a result, development aid is not only ineffective, but sometimes even harmful, because it does not deal with the specific problems of the country in question and, in addition, there is a lack of coordination and control. In my opinion, it is highly doubtful whether an EU-wide financing instrument for development and human rights can improve this situation. On the one hand, giving money to small African farmers, while, on the other hand, bringing them to the brink of ruin with our subsidised agricultural products, means that we are throwing European taxpayers’ money down the drain.

With the phase-out period that we have now decided on, these countries will receive support to explore other production options. This is important support and we understand that the adaptation can take time.

      <p sl="it">In view of the situation of the trade in bananas, whereas bananas are the world’s fourth biggest agricultural export and their production has a major impact on local communities, and whereas the EU’s tariff-rate quota system has created the conditions which enable the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to export substantial quantities of bananas to the EU and has protected a large number of jobs linked to banana production, my favourable position on the subject underlines the fact that the agreements reached settle the various disputes that have arisen so far.</p>

It is imperative that we change our model to guarantee food sovereignty and the development of local production for all. The financial measures proposed by the European Commission to assist ACP producers (Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM)) and the outermost regions of the European Union (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI)) are insufficient.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the draft decision on the conclusion of an Agreement on Trade in Bananas. Bananas are the world’s fourth most important crop, and make a major contribution to food security. However, in most banana producing countries, production is exclusively for the domestic and occasionally regional markets, with only 20% of global production being traded internationally. Control of the banana trade is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of companies, with just five major multinationals controlling more than 80% of all internationally traded bananas. On 15 December 2009, the EU, a group of Latin American countries and the United States reached an agreement on the EU’s tariffs on banana imports, bringing to a close one of the most protracted and bitter disputes in the multilateral trading system’s recent history. The agreement consists of three basic components: an agreed schedule of tariff reductions for most-favoured nation (MFN) banana exporters; agreement on how to deal with ‘tropical products’ and products subject to ‘preference erosion’ in the wider WTO negotiations; a financial package, amounting to EUR 190 million, of assistance to ACP banana exporters, to be known as the Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) programme. The disputes on bananas have destabilised the climate for production and trade in the countries concerned. The deal will make the global market in bananas more predictable and stable, and thereby encourage investment and growth, and increased attention to wider production condition issues in the banana supply chains.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the agreement on the banana trade, which brings a definitive end to the 16-year commercial dispute over banana imports between the EU and American countries. The seriousness of the problem is documented by the judgements of the European Court of Justice, which has been confronted with a discriminatory regime for EU banana imports. I applaud the fact that banana imports are finally being put on an even footing, ending the unjustified favouritism towards former European colonies, which distorts global trade in bananas. Even after commercial conditions have been put on an even footing, however, the hitherto favoured farmers from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific will not cease to receive preferential treatment. As a compensation measure, support of EUR 200 million has been drawn up, which is supposed to help them prepare for the tougher competition. I fear that we will sooner or later have to accept the fact that African bananas simply cannot compete against Latin American ones, however, because of lower quality and higher production costs. At the same time, I would like to express the hope that, after a successful end to the banana negotiations, attention will turn to reducing import duties on other tropical fruit as well, which should reduce the price of such fruit and thereby be of benefit to all EU citizens.</p>

The Czech Government supports the change to import regimes which modifies the reduced customs duties levied on imports of this agricultural commodity from third countries, and welcomes the Geneva Agreement regulating trade in this commodity. Actual agricultural output and international trade in this commodity, and especially access to the EU market, are key issues for many of the affected countries. We should always take this into account when drafting the common agricultural policy of the EU. As the texts suggest, the negotiated conditions should help to establish some stability in this area. The basis, however, should continue to be an assessment of the impacts on affected countries, together with an estimate of possible development in the longer term. Despite the priority accorded to the amendment of international trade regulations, we should not forget the importance of this commodity for end consumers. It is important to maintain the appropriate nutritional values of this food and for it to be produced in an environmentally friendly way. Decent quality should not ultimately be forgotten, but rather given a higher priority than quantity.</p>

Shortly after the Geneva Agreement was signed, Colombia and Peru obtained a greater tariff reduction, thus proving that the agreement provides no legal certainty and has not settled the banana dispute as it claims. This differential treatment prompted Ecuador and Guatemala to demand equal treatment and threaten to lodge further appeals at the WTO. Furthermore, this agreement seriously harms a sector that provides countless jobs not only in our ACP partner countries but also in the outermost regions (ORs). The aid the EU is providing to support producers in the ORs has been calculated on the basis of the laws approved at the WTO in 2006.

To give one’s assent to this agreement is to support the Commission in a strategy that is inconsistent with the EU’s effort in favour of the ORs and the ACP countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">In December 2009, the European Union, a group of Latin American countries and the United States reached an agreement on the EU’s tariffs on banana imports. Conclusion of this agreement brought to a close one of the most protracted disputes in the multilateral trading system’s recent history. EU banana import policies had recently been the subject of a decade-long row at the World Trade Organisation, pitting the EU against several Latin American banana producers and the US.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot ignore the possibility, however, that the tariff changes resulting from implementation of the agreement will have a negative impact on the livelihoods of the Union’s own banana producers. I therefore call on the Commission to ensure that a serious, independent impact assessment is conducted in the coming months to check for any negative effects and the consequences of the entry into force of the agreement for EU banana producers. It should also perhaps revise upwards the aid measures foreseen under POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity).</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the report on the proposal repealing the Council Regulation on the tariff rates for bananas. The EU’s banana import regime allowed 775,000 tonnes of the fruit from ACP countries to enter the EU duty-free each year, with a EUR 176/t tariff on bananas from all other exporters (most-favoured nation (MFN) suppliers). Many Latin American countries long insisted that this import regime illegally discriminated in favour of bananas from ACP countries and violated WTO rules on quantitative restrictions. Under the terms of the deal, the EU will gradually cut its tariffs on Latin American banana exports, until they are reduced to the level of EUR 114/t. The agreement also contains a clause stating that Latin American banana exporters will drop all actions against the EU in the WTO: ‘once the WTO certifies the EU’s new tariff schedule, Latin American banana-supplying countries will drop all their disputes on bananas with the EU at the WTO, and any claims they made against the EU after new member countries joined the Union, or when the EU changed its banana tariff in 2006’ and will not seek further tariff reductions on bananas in the Doha Round.</p>

No one will be surprised to hear that, every year, we produce more electrical and electronic waste. The products in question are, in fact, all ones that we use in our everyday lives (telephones, televisions, computers, and so on). It is estimated that only a third of the 9 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste produced each year is recycled at present. The aim of this directive is to increase this rate and to stop wastage, but it is also a question of making producers more responsible. Indeed, we are calling on the Member States to ensure that producers foot the bill for the collection and treatment of products to be recycled. Consumers, who already make a significant contribution to waste management, must be supported and assisted in this task by retailers and product sellers.</p>

      <p sl="it">As the report in question points out, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU.

      <p sl="it">A number of problems relating to implementation have come to light during the process of revising the directive.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the proposal for a directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment. Waste electrical and electronic equipment represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU and we therefore face a range of challenges. According to the Commission’s impact assessment, 85% of electronic waste is already being collected. A comparison of the quantity of waste equipment collected with the number of appliances coming onto the market yields the figure of 65% as the proportion of appliances sold which will subsequently be collected. However, these quantities are not being reported to official registers and, indeed, much of the waste concerned is not being properly treated: only 33% of waste equipment is being officially reported, collected and treated in line with the directive’s stipulations. The challenge in the current review, therefore, is to increase these rates. Efforts to prevent illegal shipment need to begin, notably, at Member State level. It is the Member States’ responsibility to see that the directive is implemented and, specifically, that its implementation is enforced and monitored. Large quantities of waste equipment are still being shipped illegally to countries outside the EU. In too many cases, such equipment is being declared as used but functional and, on that basis, is being exported beyond the Union. A simpler distinction between waste and used equipment therefore needs to be introduced with the help of the directive.</p>

On the other hand, we are tackling the problem of loss of raw materials here, which is one of the key issues in the globalised economy. According to the available data, 85% of electronic waste is currently recycled, although only 33% of this waste is officially recorded and handled in compliance with the provisions of the EU directive, of course. I cannot unequivocally support the view of the ENVI Committee, according to which costs connected with the collection, processing, exploitation and environmentally friendly disposal of waste from electronic equipment should be borne on the basis of the ‘polluter pays’ principle. On the contrary, I take the view that producers, retailers and consumers should not pay for the collection of waste from households and transportation to collection points, and that responsibility for this should now rest directly with local authorities. At the same time, I do not see any difficulty with producers having the option, when selling a new product to a consumer, to indicate the costs for collecting and recycling the product. I would consider it beneficial for consumers to be informed of these costs, as this will encourage them to behave in an environmentally responsible way.</p>

Separate collection is a precondition to ensure specific treatment and recycling of WEEE and is necessary to achieve the chosen level of protection of human health and the environment.

      <p sl="it">I fully agree with the aim of this directive and am convinced of the need to separate waste in order to reduce its environmental impact and increase the amount recycled. Two changes are needed to achieve this: used household appliances must be disposed of properly, and their management needs to be improved. The directive addresses both of these, for purposes with which I fully agree.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I find I have to point out a few critical flaws. First of all, the set targets are too ambitious and could be counterproductive. I also think that disposal costs should be included in a wider system of incentives and penalties, and should also be transparent to those who have to bear them. Apart from that, some very important points also emerge. I believe, for example, that consumer information should be given in the most effective way possible, so as to avoid people developing bad habits due to a lack of information. Given the objectives and overall structure of the directive, I am in favour of adopting it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is absolutely crucial to establish clear rules and objectives for the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in order to sustainably consolidate the internal market and improve environmental quality in the European Union, as well as to recover strategic raw materials. We really need to know how to make better use of the resources available, particularly in view of the known scarcity of raw materials, and to value the wealth or added value that waste represents for our economy. Given the discrepancies within the EU in WEEE collection – from 16 kg per person per year to just 1 kg – I would highlight the need to ensure a greater effort at harmonisation, with a minimum of 4 kg per person by 2012 being perfectly reasonable. In a developed Europe, it is important to achieve the target of collecting 85% of electrical and electronic equipment by 2016 (according to the draft amendment that I tabled in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and which was adopted) and recycling between 50% and 75% of that. I would also highlight the proposal I made, and which was adopted in committee, for the Member States to submit data every year on the volumes of WEEE generated.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Flows of waste electrical and electronic equipment are increasing in the European Union. Taking this reality into account, an amendment is proposed to the 2002 Directive, which has been in force up to now. The collection and processing of waste electrical and electronic equipment are important and necessary, bearing in mind not only the potential consequences of this waste for the environment and public health, but also the loss of secondary raw materials if such processes are not performed, which represents a serious problem. Approximately 85% of the waste electrical and electronic equipment produced is already collected in the EU. However, there are illegal shipments of this waste outside the EU, which reinforces the important role of Member States in the monitoring and inspection of collection and processing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The proposed directive provides for various possible approaches for Member States: from restricting the number of companies authorised to collect waste equipment, through increasing the number of collection points, to forcing producers to create incentive systems for consumers to deliver waste equipment. In any case, the objective is more recycling and greater re-use. Therefore, we voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Electrical and electronic waste are recycled in completely different ways. Electrical waste is dismantled and then recycled, while electronic waste, following initial dismantling, is usually subjected to chemical processing. These two groups differ significantly in weight, which means that electrical waste makes the collection rate higher, while electronic waste, which is rich in gold, silver and rare earth metals, often ends up on rubbish tips. Progress in the area of electrical and electronic equipment means a longer usable life span, a reduction in the weight of individual appliances as a result of miniaturisation and a reduction in energy consumption. Part of our innovative activity should be directed towards these ends, and this should also include design to facilitate recovery.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the provisions of this directive do not stimulate innovativeness, and the waste streams are growing at a terrifying pace. In order to achieve this proposal, an appropriate tax should be imposed on the producer or importer when a product is put on the market. The funds obtained in this way can be used by innovative small and medium-sized enterprises which are engaged in the market-based recovery of secondary materials from waste electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This directive turns over to the Member States the administrative necessity of organising the collection and subsequent processing of very different and complex technical structures which are also very difficult to recycle. These products are reaching the markets of these countries and they should be subject to the laws of the market there. Unfortunately, the fact that market mechanisms are not being adequately used in the recycling of waste products means that the draft resolution requires further work. Therefore, I abstained from voting.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I agreed with this proposal, because waste electrical and electronic equipment represents the fastest-growing waste stream. On the one hand, we need to address the environmental and health consequences if this equipment is not properly treated and disposed of and, on the other, there is a serious problem of loss of raw materials. In a globalised economy, the efficient and innovative use of energy, materials and resources is a key issue. Stepping up the collection and proper treatment of this waste in accordance with the directive thus constitutes a major challenge and necessity. We must consider and promote the appropriate collection and treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment, because decisive measures help to promote balanced economic growth without harming the environment and clean and healthy surroundings for our citizens. I agree with the opinion that not just manufacturers and Member States, but we consumers ourselves must contribute to the creation of clean and healthy surroundings and must bear a significant share of responsibility for ensuring that waste equipment is disposed of properly. Too many appliances either lie forgotten and unused in drawers or cupboards or end up, illegally, in the domestic waste bin. The Member States must use all available means to achieve ambitious collection rates, although the objectives outlined will not be easy to achieve. That the task is possible is clear from the rates already achieved in some countries. If we want to maintain a high level of consumption in the future, we must act more responsibly with natural capital that remains and not waste it.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on achieving this important goal. Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU and we therefore face a range of challenges.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the one hand we need to address the environmental and health consequences if this equipment is not properly treated and disposed of and, on the other, there is a serious problem of loss of raw materials. In a globalised economy, the efficient and innovative use of energy, materials and resources is a key issue. Stepping up the collection and proper treatment of this waste in accordance with the directive thus constitutes a major challenge.</p>
      <p sl="it">The proposed amendments are designed to increase the rate of separated collection, to reduce loss of waste equipment within the ‘WEEE system’, while preventing illegal shipment, and also to ensure that WEEE receives appropriate, high-quality treatment. In addition, red-tape at national level should be reduced, thus removing impediments to the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="en">Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU and we therefore face a range of challenges: 9 million tonnes now, growing to 12.3 million by 2020. Taking into account these quantities, there is a good business case for retrieving more WEEE: more revenue and jobs for the waste treatment sector; a contribution to the employment of the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged; recovered material has an estimated value of around EUR 2 billion a year. There are important scarce raw materials in WEEE that we should retrieve to lower the need for imports. The recast was very urgently needed in order to tackle climate change, to avoid environmental damage through bad waste management and to keep hold of the valuable resources in electric and electronic equipment. We will need high collection rates, high recycling rates and adequate recycling standards, strong legislation against illegal exports, far-reaching producer’s responsibility, better designed equipment and a fair distribution of responsibilities and costs between producers, consumers and public authorities.</p>

Indeed, we need to avoid the serious consequences that improper disposal of WEEE can have in terms of damage to the environment and public health and loss of raw materials.

      <p sl="fr">Eight years after the adoption of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, the European Parliament is once again giving its opinion on the important issue of recycling high-tech equipment waste. Despite undeniable improvements in the treatment, recovery and disposal of this type of waste (of the 5.8 tonnes of waste produced per person per year in Europe, it accounts for a tiny 20 kilograms per person on average), progress still needs to be made. I therefore welcome the adoption, this lunchtime, of the Florenz report, which strengthens the European Commission’s objective of achieving an 85% collection rate and a 50-75% recycling rate, depending on the type of waste, throughout the Union in 2016. How could one possibly overlook, for example, the importance of recovering the precious materials contained in a whole range of equipment: one tonne of mobile phones contains around 280 grams of gold and 140 grams of platinum and palladium! This is good economic sense being used to protect the environment. In the same spirit, I supported the five-year exclusion of solar panels from the framework of the directive. I believe this is an excellent way of promoting this clean technology.</p>

      <p sl="en">Today’s vote is a welcome step to tightening up EU rules on electric waste, notably ensuring more effective collection and treatment of WEEE. The EP has voted to redress the low collection rates, improper treatment and illegal exports of WEEE to third countries. By 2016, at least 85% of the waste that is arising annually should be collected, and all of it properly treated. This is an important step forward. Another important improvement is the provision to ensure that retailers will now be obliged to take back very small waste appliances, such as light bulbs or mobile phones, regardless of whether a new appliance is sold at the same time. This applies to all retailers, including distant sellers (with the exception of micro-enterprises). Increasing the collection of these appliances and raising consumer awareness about this should reduce the amount of these small appliances ending up in the general waste stream and thereby escaping adequate treatment.</p>

      <p sl="en">I fully support the decision to update the Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE) Directive. The hazardous substances often produced by waste from electrical and electronic equipment can cause huge health and environment risks. By ensuring that waste is recycled and reused, the directive will improve the environmental performance of producers and distributors. New targets for recycling, reusing and collecting waste include an 85% collection rate for Member States. The updated directive will also harmonise Member States’ reporting and regulation measures, in order to simplify administrative procedures and cut costs for companies. I am certain that approving the amendments to this directive has the potential to produce health and environmental benefits and will contribute to the objectives of the EU’s resource efficiency agenda. However, in light of the cuts facing local authorities, it is important that councils wanting to introduce kerbside collection are supported financially by producers.</p>

      <p sl="de">I naturally support the idea of improving the levels of collection of electrical equipment throughout Europe, not least because it will enable us to reuse scarce raw materials more effectively. I would like to highlight the fact that my home country of Germany is in a particularly good position in this respect and has put in place balanced recycling solutions for businesses and consumers. This system does not need to be changed to improve the way in which we reuse raw materials. The Commission also did not want to introduce any changes. However, the report that we have just voted on unfortunately imposes a number of additional burdens which may have an excessive impact on businesses, including electricians, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being hardest hit. For this reason, I have not voted in favour of this report. The obligation to collect equipment, even that which does not form part of a company’s product range, which in some circumstances involves separating products that do and do not contain toxic substances and broken and reusable products, will involve additional costs and a great deal of extra bureaucracy. We must not allow this to happen, in particular to SMEs. Excluding the smallest companies which have very small premises is not enough. The approach that has been taken is admirable, but it fails to tackle the problem as a whole and does not follow the ‘think small first’ principle, laid down in EU policy on medium-sized companies.</p>

As a result, the trouble was violently suppressed and human lives were lost. I therefore welcome the initiative to set up a commission of inquiry. Moreover, I believe that monitoring the application of the human rights clause will avoid a recurrence of such incidents. The Tunisian people need support in developing properly working state institutions. At EU level, the case of Tunisia urgently necessitates a change of priorities with regard to third countries.

The EU and Tunisia were in the process of formulating the Action Plan for the period 2011-2016, and this process will require both partners to commit themselves to achieving greater progress on all the issues involved, in particular that of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Parliament condemns the repressive measures and the disproportionate force employed by the security forces, but gives its strong support to the democratic process in the country. It is therefore very important to create the necessary conditions for the holding of elections, within a time frame which gives all opposition forces and all the media time to organise at national level, for a new parliamentary assembly with the task of drawing up a democratic constitution which strikes a proper balance between the powers of the executive and the legislature and the independence of the judiciary.

The European Union must express its solidarity with the peoples in the Arab countries who are on the streets now or have been. However, it is important that the motivation for coming out on the streets is driven by legitimate democratic aspirations and the need to improve social and living conditions. With its democratic tradition, the EU must condemn the acts of repression and disproportionate use of force by law enforcement, which has led to fatalities. The democratic process in these countries where the situation is still uncertain must be supported with conviction. Indeed, the European Union has a great duty in this regard. The necessary conditions must be created now for organising free elections, along with the adoption of democratic constitutions which will guarantee freedom of expression, political pluralism and the principle of electivity.

The Tunisian president’s departure does not also mean the disappearance of his regime, which remains a source of tension. I share the concern of Tunisians about keeping ministers from the previous regime in power, some of whom were involved in quelling the demonstrations. I believe that it is the EU’s duty to encourage a process for establishing democracy on sound foundations so as to discourage the conditions for replacing one form of totalitarianism with another.

I extend my solidarity to the peoples who are fighting for their rights in North Africa and the Middle East, as I did to the peoples of Eastern Europe not so long ago.

We must also urgently review our neighbourhood policy with third countries and make the inclusion of human rights clauses an essential condition of all our trade agreements.</p>

      <p sl="it">In recent months the European Union has examined its neighbourhood policy, emphasising the distinction between the political objectives pursued by the Member States of the Mediterranean and those of Central, Eastern and Northern Europe. None of this, however, has resulted in an analysis capable of preventing what has happened and is still happening in various African countries. I fully support the objectives contained in the motion for a resolution tabled today in this House; they are objectives which the European Parliament as a whole wishes to pursue with regard to the situation in Tunisia. Condemning the repressive measures and the disproportionate use of violence, requesting the freezing of the ill-gotten assets of the Ben Ali family, and supporting the establishment of three committees aimed at combating the corruption that has characterised Tunisia’s system of government for the last 23 years: those were the requests made today by the European Parliament. Lastly, we call on the High Representative to take the decision to intervene in support of the population via a task force, which Parliament should also be involved in organising. I consider it vital at this time for the European Union to make its presence felt among the Tunisian people and to put them back on the path to real democracy.</p>

It should be pointed out that vaccines are an essential means of combating tuberculosis, together with better testing. Testing must be reliable, low-cost and accessible to all patients, along with more effective diagnosis and treatment.

Unfortunately, Romania has a poor record in terms of the spread of this disease, topping the league table for tuberculosis patients in the European Union, where it will remain for a long time, according to the experts. In these circumstances, the programmes run by the EU and finances allocated for TB treatment are especially welcome, and the investment in Europeans’ health is important. According to data from the Romanian authorities, 30 000 new cases of tuberculosis appear in Romania every year. One possible explanation for detecting this large number of cases every year is precisely the increase in the level of progress through the emergence of new prevention programmes, the majority of which are funded by the EU. Although Romania still has the highest incidence of tuberculosis in Europe, the values for this indicator have seen a significant reduction in the last five years. There has also been a downward trend in the mortality figures recorded for tuberculosis in Romania, from 10.7% in 2002 to 7.6% in 2008.

That means a major re-alignment of research and increased and sustained funding, in which I believe that the EU can play an essential role.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This joint motion for a resolution, replacing the motions by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is intended to promote the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI) with a view to meeting the targets defined by the United Nations in the Millennium Development Goals. These include reversing the trend in the number of patients with tuberculosis by 2015 and eliminating the disease by 2050. Improving the state of health of the world population is one of the European Union’s major concerns. Although tuberculosis can be said to be controlled in Europe, it still causes the deaths of millions of people in developing countries, in association with other contagious diseases. It is essential to pool political and financial efforts in order to put a swift end to this worldwide scourge. I therefore welcome the approval of this initiative to eradicate this contagious disease, which even in the 21st century is still causing many deaths, especially in developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Efforts in the field of the research and development of new drugs and vaccines that are effective against diseases such as tuberculosis, which, with each passing year, continues to take millions of lives throughout the world, must be stimulated and positive results warmly welcomed. Once these results have been obtained, it is necessary to make available the new advancements in science and technology to those who need them, without any kind of exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, the sole criterion for access must be need. In the third world, the payment of foreign debt and interest for servicing debt to rich countries represents a major drain on resources, which therefore do not go to health and education budgets, which are reduced to almost insignificance. The so-called ‘structural adjustment programmes’, imposed from outside, also contribute to this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, the fight against diseases, which, like tuberculosis, spread in poverty, includes combating these mechanisms that create and sustain dependence and poverty. In this context, it is regrettable that making the new tuberculosis vaccine available to less developed countries – which obviously we advocate – can be advocated in the name of strengthening the role and leadership of the EU in these countries, as is done in the question that gave rise to this motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I do find it surprising, however, that a text which deplores the inadequate health services in developing countries should choose to overlook one of the greatest scandals of our time: the plundering of doctors from these countries by wealthier countries, which have given up training their own doctors sufficiently in the belief that they can cut back on their social protection. Hence, in France, the numerus clausus , or the number of students allowed to proceed to the second year, is around 7 000, whereas every year almost 3 000 doctors with degrees obtained outside Europe are allowed to practise in France. This is without mentioning the foreign students that we train, who thus have French degrees and who never leave. At the same time, the WHO estimates that there is a shortfall of 4.5 million health professionals in poor countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also strange how the text chooses to overlook the 5 500 to 6 000 cases of tuberculosis in France. The disease had been eradicated there, and its recurrence can be directly linked to mass immigration. I do not believe that we are an isolated case in Europe on this issue, either.</p>

It is a disease which represents a serious danger to people and is the second greatest cause of death among infectious diseases worldwide. Tuberculosis is heavily linked to social and economic problems, such as poverty, unemployment, alcoholism, drug addiction and HIV/AIDS, as well as the inadequate and poor state of healthcare systems in poor countries and delays in diagnosis. I am pleased that the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative model has been drawn up, because all patients suffering from this disease worldwide will be able to benefit from the results of research and work activities. I would also like to point out that there is still insufficient funding for the fight against tuberculosis, and it is necessary to provide for specific funding mechanisms that will contribute to the licensing in Europe of tuberculosis vaccines, vaccine accessibility, clinical research into tuberculosis and more effective diagnosis and treatment, and money allocated to healthcare services must reach countries’ poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.</p>

I believe that it is not enough to suggest eradicating by 2050 a disease that affects the poorest and is one of the main causes of death in the world, leading to more than 2 million deaths every year. This is because, as a number of studies carried out by non-governmental organisations point out, this period could be halved with a robust policy and the resulting increase in resources intended for combating it. Furthermore, while I agree with the statement in paragraph 2 that it is important to improve detection and vaccination procedures with more effective diagnosis and treatments, I object to the failure to expressly mention that such services should be carried out by public health services; it is these that should be strengthened by receiving European aid and cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">The tuberculosis vaccine programme is very important, but what is the European Parliament going to do before 2015? In Latvia, for example, the process of medical treatment for tuberculosis currently consists of diagnosis-making and staying in quarantine. In fact, all the funds that were supposed to be spent on the purchase of medical equipment and the construction of specialised hospitals were spent in vain. For instance, in a town called Olaine there was a hospital constructed on the territory of a prison to treat people infected by tuberculosis. The amount of money spent to equip the hospital amounted to two million euro. That hospital is not functioning now since there is no medical staff! Therefore I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that it is not enough merely to create and produce a vaccine, it is necessary to prepare specialists with focused specialisation and highly qualified medical personnel and to deploy them in a battle against tuberculosis. Otherwise, the effect of today’s voting will be no more than emotional. It is highly important to have absolutely transparent scrutiny of funds allocated to the fight against tuberculosis in order not to repeat the Latvian situation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Every year EUR 2 billion is spent on treating people with tuberculosis in the European Union. Alongside HIV and malaria, tuberculosis is one of the most widespread epidemics in the world. Around one third of the world’s population is infected. It is clear that we are far from eradicating tuberculosis. As in the case of all diseases, increasing resistance in the form of multi-resistant or even ultra-resistant bacteria and the resulting lack of treatment options are presenting modern medicine with a major challenge. The standard drugs, which have been used since the 1960s, have no impact on mutated variants. As a result, other medicines are prescribed which are more expensive and have more powerful side effects. The subsequent treatment costs can be up to one hundred times higher than those of normal tuberculosis. If a patient stops taking the standard drugs for the normal form of tuberculosis before the end of the six-month period, the result is not only severe side effects, but also resistance. In addition, it is only possible to stop the disease spreading by investigating all the people with whom the patient has had contact. Some countries have not complied with these requirements. If these well-known basic rules are not followed, research projects costing billions of euros are unlikely to bring about any major changes and new types of resistance will occur.

      <p sl="pt">It is regrettable that a European institution financed from the public purse should not have a transparent administrative model that enables the supervisory body to discharge its accounts. The rarity of such an event makes it necessary to analyse the causes and find solutions that prevent it from reoccurring.

      <p sl="en">Inefficient use by the Police College of funds allocated to it has already led to disruption in financial support for small agencies. There are cases of inappropriate use of funds which border on financial crimes. All these transgressions may happen when there is not enough scrutiny from the Commission. Parliament’s decision on this issue gives a clear signal to all other agencies and institutions that it is necessary to stick to financial discipline and to be more responsible in respect of the duties they have. Nor would it be wasteful to relieve of their posts those Commission officials who stood by for a long time and failed to act resolutely and efficiently. I know of many cases in which Commission officials – either because of their unconstructive position or sometimes even laziness – closed their eyes to serious violations in European Union financial projects. I consider this resolution to be very timely and useful.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Police College (CEPOL) brings together senior police officers from across Europe, with the aim of encouraging cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime and maintenance of public safety, law and order. Established as an agency of the European Union in 2005, CEPOL operates as a network in which activities – courses, seminars, conferences and meetings – are organised in and by the Member States, mainly at the national training institutes. Between 60 and 100 courses, seminars and conferences are organised per year which cover a wide range of topics relevant to policing in Europe today. CEPOL’s activity is fundamental to the creation of synergies between the police forces of the various Member States.In fact, it is currently the primary source of learning and development in the field of education and training for better cooperation and policing in Europe. For the above reasons, and particularly in the light of the positive opinions of the Court of Auditors and the Council, I am voting in favour of the closing of CEPOL’s accounts for the financial year 2008.</p>

      <p sl="lt">As the vote by Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control demonstrated, many people were unhappy with the way the European Police College managed its finances in 2008 and previous years. This is a unique situation – until now no European agency has ever failed to be granted discharge. However, now it is important to look to the future. General Banfi, the new head of the European Police College, has taken over a difficult situation and must regain the trust of Parliament and taxpayers. Furthermore, I believe that the ongoing discussions on the College’s ineffective management of the budget and human resources are only diverting our attention from a greater problem - the lack of integrity and professionalism in police and security bodies throughout Europe, including Lithuania. We must devote more attention to efforts to improve the Police College’s basic functions – we must take more robust measures to combat crime, through education and special training. As I said during the part-session last October, the European Police College has noble objectives – to promote common European policing standards and strengthen the rule of law and legislation. What happens to the European Police College in future is not important, but all Member States must ensure that these objectives are achieved.</p>

MEPs now need to turn our attention towards the discharge procedure for 2009, which is underway in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and introducing changes to ensure stronger accounting procedures are put in place.

I also believe that it is unfortunate that there is no female candidate for a post at this level and hope that the candidates for the position of Executive Director would reflect a better choice. It is also unfortunate that two political groups, the Greens and the ALDE (some, not all), managed to direct their disapproval at these Chairs for issues unrelated to the tasks they will face as Chairs. Consequently, one can only imagine that there are other issues behind their choices which demonstrate the lack of sensitivities to this European project. After all, we demand independence for the actions to be undertaken by these European Supervisory Authorities and yet they contradict that independence by disqualifying the results of that independent choice with an unwarranted rejection vote.</p>

      <p sl="pt">voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the waste crisis in the province of Campania, because I believe that, in the context of the waste management crisis, it is essential to implement the derogation from the regulations and controls, which includes, for example, exemption from conducting environmental impact assessments and the non-application of legislation on public contracts. I also believe it essential that fulfilling EU waste legislation in Campania and in other regions of Europe demands a major effort to reduce the volume of waste and tip the balance towards the prevention, reduction, re-use and recycling of waste by providing adequate infrastructure, and that greater emphasis must be placed on the recycling of organic waste, particularly in this markedly agricultural region.</p>

      <p sl="it">We understand the Commission’s reasons, but the waste crisis in Campania will not be solved by imposing financial penalties and nor will it be solved by suspending the payment of EUR 135 million in contributions for the period 2006-2013, plus a further EUR 10.5 million for the period 2000-2006, which was intended for the funding of waste-related projects.</p>
      <p sl="it">The solution to the crisis lies instead in the healthy renewal of the political and operational situation. The new regional government, which was only installed in June last year, has unfortunately inherited 15 years of neglect and delays. Even so, it has already launched an integrated waste collection and disposal plan, which also includes putting the necessary facilities in place and reaching agreements with five regions of Italy for the temporary transfer of waste until the plan becomes fully operational. Future action to be taken must focus on transparency and dialogue between the people and the local authorities, on making citizens accept responsibility for the disposal of domestic waste, and also on better use of organic waste.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope the Commission will appreciate the willingness and commitment of the new regional government and will soon see fit to release the European funding intended for this region so as to encourage its growth, subject of course to proper, rigorous controls and compliance with EU legislation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Whereas the vote on the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment was rather technical, the vote on the motion for a resolution concerning the waste crisis in Campania is eminently political. In rejecting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which would have distorted the text, Parliament has voted by a majority for Italy to comply with the European rules on waste treatment. In this joint motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, we call on Italy to take immediate action to comply with the rules, and this means combating the involvement of organised crime in an area that is regarded as a very lucrative market. The health and environmental situation in that region is already very alarming. Hence we believe that European funds should not be released until something is done to improve the situation. It is unthinkable to see the development of a Europe of ever stricter health and environmental rules on the one hand, and of areas exempt from all legislation on the other.</p>

      <p sl="it">The impact of the waste crisis on the tourism sector is extremely bad, as shown by alarming figures recently published by the tourism organisations. The situation has damaged not only the transport companies but also small and medium-sized businesses and the hotel and catering facilities in the region. The impact on employment in the sector is liable to get even worse if appropriate action is not taken urgently. The Italian authorities have already provided the Commission with a plan to restore legality. The policies currently being implemented are aimed not only at cleaning up the regional capital but, above all, at organising an integrated waste system involving separate collection, a reduction in the waste produced, the construction of modern facilities and the restoration of former landfill sites. I am looking forward to a swift and definitive solution to the problem of waste disposal so as to protect both Italy’s image and the tourist economy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the waste crisis in Campania. Compliance with EU law on waste in Campania calls for very energetic efforts to cut the volume of waste and tip the balance towards waste prevention, reduction, re-use and recycling. More emphasis must be placed on the recovery of organic waste, particularly in this largely agricultural region. Furthermore, it is recommended that the data should be verified and that a system of exchanges of best practice be established. The European Parliament considers that the exceptional measures employed over long periods by the Italian authorities, including the appointment of special commissioners or the designation of waste sites as being of ‘strategic interest’ under army control, have been counterproductive. It calls, therefore, for much greater transparency on the part of the various authorities responsible. Furthermore, it is important to rebuild trust by means of structured dialogue between the public and the various authorities involved and between the various levels of government.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union has taken on the role of setting an example in the fight against climate change and in promoting environmental quality. It is well known that efforts need to be redoubled in the area of the proper collection and treatment of waste, in order to improve quality of life and economic development by managing and disposing of it better. It is in this context that I support measures that will incentivise environmental best practices in the problematic region of Campania, in Italy. I would stress that the local risks, in terms of harmful effects, resulting from the inadequate treatment and storage of waste will certainly have repercussions on the public’s quality of life. Public awareness needs to be raised and mobilised regarding proper waste management as a decisive factor in protecting the environment and promoting the quality of life of both current generations and future ones. However, the efforts and ability of local authorities need to be acknowledged: they took extraordinary measures during the last urban waste crisis, in autumn 2010, in order to comply with the 4 March 2010 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As part of the urgency to find a solution to the problem of the waste crisis in Campania, Italy, the approved document refers to the need to ‘tip the balance towards the prevention, reduction and re-use and recycling of waste’. Something that the waste crisis in Campania does demonstrate is the danger of submitting environmental management – in its many aspects – to the simple logic of profit.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given its nature and hazards, its obvious and close links with pressing public health and environmental issues, the question of waste is paradigmatic in that its management has to be ensured by efficient, high-quality public services, since it is not acceptable to leave it to market dynamics. The indignation of the population, which has been vividly demonstrated, is entirely understandable in this case. We must express serious concerns about the incrimination of citizens who demonstrated peacefully and also about the violence inflicted on them by the security forces.</p>

The resolution explicitly mentions and criticises measures introduced by the current government, but forgets that the current Mayor of Naples, Mrs Iervolino, belongs to the centre-left and, worse still, forgets the long reign of Mr Bassolino, who was Mayor of Naples from 1993 to 2000 and Governor of Campania from 2000 to 2010, as well as special commissioner for the waste crisis for many years.</p>

Parliament has also called on the Italian authorities to examine and remove ‘the 7 million tonnes of “Ecobales” which have accumulated into stockpiles and to tackle the “illegal dumping of mixed and unidentified waste” in the region.’ At this time, it is imperative that we do not underestimate the legitimate concerns and complaints of the people of the region.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In recent years, the Italian region of Campania has been struggling with serious problems in terms of collecting and disposing of waste, which are having a grave effect on the wellbeing of the local population, and are leading to serious risks to the environment and to public health. It is therefore essential, following the 14 May 2010 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, for the Italian authorities to adopt the measures necessary to definitively and satisfactorily resolve the waste management crises in this region, whilst ensuring full compliance with EU law.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Despite the citizens’ protests, there has been no development in the dreadful waste management situation in Campania – in fact, there has been hardly any progress at all in my view. Given the scale of the current crisis, I urge the Italian authorities to work towards finding a real solution to the situation, in accordance with the European rules in force. As for the decision to open landfills in protected areas, I share the view that European regional funds should not be released in these conditions. Greater transparency in order to combat the involvement of organised crime and restore confidence among the local populations is also essential if this unprecedented crisis is to be resolved. Time is pressing, we must act fast. I therefore endorse the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the waste crisis in Campania.</p>

      <p sl="en">A big majority of the EP agreed (1) to call for a sustainable solution to be urgently identified that meets EU criteria, namely the implementation of a waste management plan in which, in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC, respect for the waste cycle hierarchy constitutes a key basis. Parliament requested the Commission to keep it informed on the state of affairs, including a waste management plan, and compliance with the Court decision of 4 March 2010 and EU rules. Parliament also pointed out (2) that compliance with EU law on waste in Campania demands a very energetic effort to diminish the volume of waste and tip the balance towards waste prevention, reduction, re-use and recycling by providing an adequate infrastructure. It noted that more emphasis must be placed on recovery of organic waste, especially in this broadly agricultural region. It recommended that the data be verified and that a system of exchange of best practice be established.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Naples urban area has for years been living in a continuous waste crisis, which to a great extent is the result of 20 years of administration by the left.</p>
      <p sl="it">The 2003 inquiry into waste management irregularities found against the former regional government on no less than eight counts, including fraud in public procurement, aiding and abetting in breaches of environmental legislation and abuse of office. In 2008, faced with 35 000 tonnes of waste abandoned on the roads, the Berlusconi Government succeeded in tackling the critical phase of the emergency in just 58 days. Since then, the authorities have succeeded in increasing separated collection rates from 15% to 22%, preparing five landfill sites to EU standards and making seven waste selection and treatment plants operational. Since 2010, the region has at last been led by a member of the centre-right and it is now about to present a new waste disposal plan agreed with the regional commissioner for the environment. A strong response is expected soon from the whole area: precisely that local initiative that was lacking during the decades of misgovernment by the left, which has only been remedied by the initiatives implemented by Silvio Berlusconi’s Government.</p>

      <p sl="et">In today’s vote I supported the joint motion for a resolution by four groups on the waste crisis in Campania. The reasons why I did so are as follows. First, it is unacceptable that such a situation has arisen, and also that the Italian national and local authorities have failed to resolve the situation. This amount of rubbish does not appear within a couple of days; it takes considerably more time. Second, while I support today’s resolution, I think that the European Parliament should not be the authority which has to clean up the Member States’ rubbish. Third, the European Union directives on waste, hazardous waste and landfills, which must apply throughout Europe, no matter which Member State we are talking about. I am awaiting a speedy and effective solution to the problem, mainly from the Italian authorities, but also from the European Union authorities. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, the waste crisis in Campania has been a headache for politicians for several decades now. It has blighted the daily lives of many Italians. It is important to get our priorities straight; there is no point in looking for people to blame. The most important thing now is to establish an integrated waste management plan, giving priority to waste reduction, reuse or recycling. In this case, I feel that the crisis in Campania offers an important lesson on waste management to all Europeans, including Lithuanians. I believe that a reduction in the amount of waste and smart management of this waste are important environmental priorities for Lithuania. The report published by the European Environment Agency in December 2010 notes that the overall amount of waste in Lithuania has grown when compared to 2004, and that municipal waste in particular is growing constantly without exponential variation. A problem is also caused, both in Campania and in Lithuania, by the complete lack of cooperation among citizens and authorities. It is essential to revive this dialogue. We need sober thinking and creative decisions. At Kariotiškės dump near Vilnius, for instance, a power plant was opened in December, which creates electricity from methane gas. Such plants have already begun operating in Utena, Marijampolė and Panevėžys. This is a good example, but we need more. Now, like never before, there is an urgent need to address the construction and funding of waste recycling plants (co-financing from the Member State’s budget, the EU and private funds), because only in this way is it possible to tangibly reduce the damage currently being done to the environment and the interests of society.</p>
