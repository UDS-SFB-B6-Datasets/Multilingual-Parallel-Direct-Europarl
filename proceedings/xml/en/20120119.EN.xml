      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2010, Parliament adopted the report by the Committee on Agriculture aimed at ensuring fair revenues for farmers. In doing so, it sent a clear message to the European Commission that it should restore the balance of power between farmers, on the one hand, and the processing and distribution industries, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, whom I particularly welcome, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, those of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), whom I thank for the support and cooperation they have provided from the very outset for my initiative of an oral question with a resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain. I would also thank all the political groups that have supported this oral question and worked determinedly on drafting the final text of this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This resolution is in response to the expectations of farmers, which have been put off for a long time, of reversing the growing imbalances in the food supply chain, in terms of both negotiating power between the parties and of income distribution. This has been provoked by the high concentration of Europe’s largest retailers and threatens the survival of farmers and suppliers in general, severely damaging the agricultural economy and rural societies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The means proposed to this end are unequivocal identification of the bad practices in the food supply chain, support for its self-regulation through joint action by all stakeholders, demand for adequate legislation by the European Commission, not forgetting the commitment needed from Member States in this area, supervision and penalties. The Union legislation needed should take into account previous decisions of the European Parliament, both those that were implemented and those that have not been realised, to which will be added the responses considered here to be suited to the present situation as regards contractual relationships between producers, suppliers and retailers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This resolution is not being set up against any of the partners in the food supply chain, but to give them closer relations and implement dialogue, so everyone’s contribution is required. This resolution is being set up against the unfair and abusive practices that have started to become established and is intended to introduce appropriate EU and national legislation, where necessary, without distorting the smooth running of the markets. As such, it is hoped it will encourage producers to have greater capacity for organising amongst themselves, and retailers to abandon dominating practices, such as the unilateral imposition of contractual conditions or practices relating to discounts, without increasing the price to the consumer but rather contributing to their having a real choice that is wider and of higher quality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are now awaiting the required initiative from the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know it is increasingly hard to be a farmer in Europe. The figures speak for themselves. According to Eurostat, production costs have gone up 40% over the last decade, whilst prices have not increased by more than 25%.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is not just upstream that farmers are being completely squeezed. Farmers downstream are also obliged to accept unimaginable prices, payment times and other contractual conditions, because of the disproportionate correlation of forces existing in the marketing chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall give the example of my own country, where the cooperative sector has little importance. Around 65% of sales of food products are concentrated in the hands of the five largest companies, with the figures much higher for some sectors, such as milk. Just last week, in my country, the authorities learned that 400 000 litres of milk on the marketing chain were being sold at below cost price.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As political decision makers, we need to ensure that agriculture remains a viable activity in Europe, producing good-quality foodstuffs and raw materials at fair prices that provide a living for farmers. To this end, there is a need for a sound common agricultural policy, but also for fair competition, as mentioned in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to follow up urgently the recommendations and suggestions formulated in the resolutions we are discussing here today, and for concrete proposals to be tabled as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I congratulate Mr Bové on his report on the farm input supply chain. It raises some very topical issues. We are all well aware that the rising cost of inputs – most notably for feed, fuel and fertiliser – is putting major pressure on farmers and continues to squeeze their margins in an economic climate that is already difficult, especially for the intensive sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically, the cost of feed has to be addressed; rising costs will force us to rethink our attitude, I believe, about soya imports from third countries and the problems associated with the protein deficit in the EU. I do not believe that domestic protein production can satisfy demand, especially if we wish to increase food production for reasons of food security. Moreover, rising food costs do not seem to result in higher farm gate prices and this has to be looked at for the benefit of both the consumer and the farmer. Large retailers must be prepared to cooperate with producers in order to ensure that the distribution of profits along the chain is equal and fair.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU imposes the strictest standards on animal welfare, environmental practices and food safety. I support the fact that the EU is the world leader in this regard, but I also think we have to find a balance between maintaining the highest standards and risking over-legislating our farmers out of business.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fear the proposals from the Commission regarding the reform of the CAP go in that direction, especially in relation to greening and direct payments and the ridiculous set-aside proposal. With regard to the issue of imbalances in the food chain, it is clear that the power of retailers has grown to what some consider to be an unacceptable level. While there are some measures the EU can take, especially as regards transparency and profits in the chain, I think that farmers need to look at how they can organise themselves better and increase their bargaining power, whether through producer organisations or cooperatives.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I should like to use all the time available to me for this debate now, if possible; all four minutes, since I have a further two minutes later.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I have a further two minutes and I should like to use them all together now, if possible. I would therefore ask you to set the clock to zero.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, the problem of farmers’ incomes is getting more serious, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized farmers and family farms, of which there are significant numbers in many Member States. Consumer prices do not reflect the prices paid to farmers for their products. The unsustainable increase in the costs of factors of production – fuel, feed, fertilisers, plant-health products, etc. – is happening at the same time as a persistent decline in the prices of products.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The consequences are the abandonment of agriculture, the unstoppable closure of farms, the desertification of the countryside, the concentration of production in the hands of large producers, and production that is increasingly intensive and geared towards exports. Imbalances between the Member States are growing; the food deficits and food dependence of countries with weaker production systems are growing; the threats to food security and sovereignty are growing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">None of this is new. All this is well known, and the causes of this profoundly negative development are also well known: the lack of instruments for regulating agricultural production, of regulation of the markets; the immeasurably increasing power of the major retailers and their abuses; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the application of World Trade Organisation rules to agriculture; and the entry of speculators into the foodstuffs market. In short, the agricultural and trade policies in force: the common agricultural policy, the common commercial policy, and the patterns on which the single market has been established and is being deepened in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Resolution of all these problems will not, therefore, be possible without profoundly changing these policies. There is a need for mechanisms regulating the food supply chain that defend producers – particularly small and medium-sized farmers, who promote employment in the countryside and bring it to life – and for reductions in food imports.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is crucial to halt and reverse the present concentration of power in the hands of the major retailers and industry. There is a need for a decentralisation of the food supply chains, for support for and promotion of local production and consumption, for shorter food supply chains, and for local markets, including using innovative media like the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is a need for measures intended to put a stop to dumping between Member States, as is happening in the milk sector, for example. There is a need for fair distribution of value added throughout the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We believe consideration should be given to the establishment of ceilings for companies’ profit margins using the price paid to producers as a benchmark, particularly for large supermarkets and retailers, and to putting a permanent stop to self-regulation, which is nothing short of a myth. There is a need to create and operate national systems for monitoring and shaping prices and price changes in retailers and large supermarkets, whilst steadfastly combating the current practices of cartelisation and price manipulation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is a need for a system of production quotas: a quota system adapted to the needs of each country and to its development in terms of production equipment, so as to enable the development of the Member States with higher deficits.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For reasons of environmental, economic and social sustainability, there is also a need to organise international trade in such a way that producers, products and countries complement each other, rather than competing, as currently happens. The vitality of the economic and social fabric in the primary sector is dependent on this, not just in Europe, but in other countries too, especially in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These, amongst many others, were some of the proposals included in the resolution tabled by our group. Unfortunately, we cannot find many of them in the report or in the other resolutions. We therefore hope that some of these proposals may be adopted here today.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, if we are talking about the European Union as a union of equal states, then it is precisely this policy of equality that we should pursue consistently. Direct payments to farmers producing agricultural products in European Union Member States must not vary, with some being paid two, three or even four times as much as others, because it is precisely these differences that orchestrate the problems which will prevent us from ever achieving balance in the food supply chain. Food production and supply chain costs are increasing for various reasons, such as increasing plant health, animal welfare, environmental protection, hygiene and food safety requirements, which are all the same for all Member States. However, the different levels of payments in European Union Member States are marginalising food producers so much that fair competition is completely out of reach.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Attention must also be drawn to another important issue – large distribution companies currently dominate food markets, and prices paid to farmers in the food supply chain are constantly being cut. At the same time, production costs continue to rise. Farmers are not receiving sufficient income for their products, while big commercial monopolies are making huge profits at the farmers’ expense. Due to the significant variation between the price paid to farmers and the final price paid by consumers, as well as the lack of transparency, the difference in competitive conditions and, in some cases, abuse in the food supply chain, farming is becoming no longer viable and farmers’ survival is under threat. I believe that the primary task of the Commission and the Member States today is to guarantee that competition rules, which operate on principles of equality, are upheld throughout the upstream and downstream food market chain.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, also on behalf of Mr Cioloş, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bové, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) for the report, and I would like to thank those who submitted oral questions about imbalances in the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="it">The prices of the means of agricultural production, of input costs, have reached record levels in recent years, although they have not been matched by a corresponding rise in the output prices of agricultural products. Despite the fact that the real prices of inputs rose by almost 18% between 2005 and 2011, agricultural prices have risen more slowly. Farm revenues also fell by more than 10% in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis, and only returned to pre-crisis levels in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">Volatility in basic agricultural commodity prices is also increasingly reflected in farm revenues, and has accentuated farmers’ loss of negotiating power in the food supply chain. Farmers therefore have to deal with a growing number of difficulties relating to the rise in input costs, as well as to improving their environmental and agronomic efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is AGRI doing to help farmers deal with these difficulties? Our work has concentrated on these problems, which are dealt with, on the one hand, within the framework of the proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) presented in October, and, on the other, in the High-Level Forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain that we launched a year ago with Mr Cioloş, Mr Dalli and Mr Barnier.</p>
      <p sl="it">The recent proposal for the CAP reform after 2013 introduces innovations aiming to increase cooperation between farmers and to clarify the scope of competition rules. The proposals also aim to facilitate the creation of producers’ organisations and associations, as well as of inter-professional organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The mandatory recognition of producer organisations is a key element of the European Union. The Commission’s proposals also include cofinancing for their creation in all Member States, regardless of the type of farming, through the second pillar of rural development.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, economies of scale will help sales by increasing the number of distribution channels and reducing risks and this, in turn, will also foster a better division of added value within the supply chain. Furthermore, our proposal with regard to contractual relations in the dairy industry aims to strengthen the position of dairy producers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The issue of crop diversity, which was raised in the report, is also dealt with in the proposal for reform of the CAP as part of the commitment to help the environment. The European Innovation Partnership for agricultural productivity and sustainability and awards for innovative local cooperation in rural areas will help to promote innovative measures throughout the food supply chain. The partnership could include projects for rationalising the use of resources, precision agriculture and so on.</p>
      <p sl="it">The CAP reform will also involve boosting the agricultural consultancy system, which will bring about better exchange of good practices and information campaigns targeting farmers and consumers. Another important topic is seeds, and an action plan is currently being developed as a follow-up to the legislation assessment carried out in 2010-2011 on the sale of seeds and reproduction materials. Adoption of a Commission proposal is scheduled for the third quarter of this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report also refers to land prices and land rent as raised by Mr Bové in his speech. The writers of a study in 2010 attempted to identify the ratio between land prices and direct payments. The Commission is ready to carry out other studies that will give a better idea of the impact of farm rents and leases on agriculture input costs.</p>
      <p sl="it">The last point I would like to discuss, also in response to the point raised by Mr Bové in his speech, before moving on to the other issues more closely linked to imbalances in the food supply chain, concerns energy and water. Improving the way enterprises use water is a win-win situation for all those involved. As well as allowing farmers to reduce their costs, it has a positive impact on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second pillar of the CAP includes mechanisms for promoting the production of renewable energies inside and outside farms located in rural areas, the transformation of agricultural and forest biomass, and investments in rationalising the use of resources also as a means of saving energy. The measures provided for in this second pillar also offer many possibilities for optimising the management of water resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">Honourable Members, the imbalances and abuses in the food supply chain are currently further aggravated by price volatility, a problem raised by the three oral questions which are subjects the Commission is focusing on in particular. Unfair commercial practices between companies can take place at all levels of the food supply chain. They are a threat to farmers, to small and medium-sized enterprises and their employees, and often also to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, what measures should we adopt? Until today, at European level, unfair commercial practices have mainly been tackled in the context of the relations between companies and consumers. As far as relations between companies are concerned, the EU has adopted measures against contractual terms and conditions and commercial practices that are clearly unfair due to delays in payments. The directive should become effective before the end of March 2013, but I recently wrote to all the ministers involved to invite them to anticipate the entry into force of this law, which is a practical application of the ‘Small Business Act’. We estimate, in fact, that this directive will help to inject around EUR 180 billion into the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is also a directive on misleading and comparative advertising, which aims to guarantee proper practices and sets rules for the authorisation of comparative advertising. Along with the communication ‘Towards a Single Market Act’, the report on monitoring distribution, and following on from this Parliament’s own-initiative report adopted last July on a more efficient, fairer retail market – the Corazza Bildt report – the Commission has also scheduled the adoption of a communication on unfair commercial practices this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">This text should clearly define the scope and breadth of the problem in retail sales and underline the fragmentary nature of national rules and their application. Madam President, I am sorry if my speech has been longer than expected, but there have been so many questions and they have been so complex; I will be much briefer in my response.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission also consulted the interested parties to find out what their perception is in the ‘European Business Test Panel’, and is currently analysing the responses it received. Once we have evaluated the data we have collected, we will look at possible spheres of action for remedying the various problems we found.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, this year, we plan to adopt a communication on the directive on misleading and comparative advertising. On a national level, some Member States have already adopted important tools to foster the management of commercial relations between companies, commercial law, policies for small and medium-sized enterprises, and laws and codes of conduct against unfair practices. The Commission has given the High-Level Forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain a mandate to work, among other things, on contractual relations between companies and on price transparency.</p>
      <p sl="it">The representatives of the agricultural sector, industry, commerce and distribution recently came to an agreement about a document on vertical relations within the food supply chain and the principles of good practice, which proposes a common definition of fairness in relations between companies. The document also proposes guidelines for commercial relations between companies, accompanied by concrete examples of unfair and fair practices.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the measures for applying these principles have not yet been evaluated, and therefore there is still an additional, delicate task to carry out. Based on the progress over the next few months, the Commission will make a decision as to whether to continue to encourage this consensual approach or, in the absence of a satisfactory agreement between the parties, it reserves the right to weigh up possible legislative action. At the moment, the Commission does not have a preferred option, and considers all alternatives valid, including the one suggested in the report by Mr Bové.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, as already announced in the communication ‘A Better Functioning Food Supply Chain in Europe’, the Commission has put forward legislative proposals to improve the transparency of the raw materials derivative markets, including agricultural commodities. These proposals specifically concern over-the-counter derivatives, financial instruments markets and market abuse.</p>
      <p sl="it">As you are well aware, the proposals are currently being debated by Parliament and the Council. Thank you for your attention, and I apologise once more to the President if my speech has been longer than planned.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, oh to be a Commissioner and be able to have so much time to speak! It was good to hear your fulsome response, Commissioner. I have less time but I will be quite blunt. I would like you to take the comments in this debate as armour and weapons into your struggles on this matter. This House is united about one issue, which is that there is a problem at both ends – and, indeed, in the centre – of the food supply chain. The Bové report, which was an initiative of mine in the EPP Group – and I thank Mr Bové for his work on it – deals with the farm input problem. It is serious, and you have acknowledged that. At the other end, we have had the excellent work of my colleague, Mrs Patrão Neves, on the imbalance of power and the need to look at this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly pleased by your words, and I quote you here, that you will ‘reserve the right to legislate’. I think the stakeholders should listen with concern and be prepared to face legislation if there is no cooperation and effective change on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you mentioned the financial services sector. I think you were right to do that. There is a huge parallel between what has happened in financial services – to the discredit of the European Union – and what is happening in the food supply chain. My interest in this House is in the food supply chain. Food security is fundamental. Are you, as Commissioner, prepared to watch over the destruction of this if we do not take action now?</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me warn you that, though we have been up early for this debate, there are others in the food chain who have been up much earlier and are taking from the pockets of producers, both their pockets, to cushion their own profits. Some of the practices that are going on you do not even know and we do not fully understand. There is something rotten in this system, and unless politicians have the bottle to call it rotten, there will be no change. Take this debate to the Commission and take action.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, allow me to make three comments which relate mainly to the farm input supply chain, but which also affect the food production chain. Firstly, I should like to emphasise that the smooth operation of the food market is inextricably bound up with the smooth operation of the farm input supply market and vice versa. Therefore, regulations are needed that will safeguard transparency in input pricing and the application of, and compliance with, competition rules both by the input supply chain and in the agri-food chain.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, I should like to point out that the quality of traditional crop seeds should be linked to the cultural heritage of the Member States, in the same way as the agricultural product quality policy. I therefore think that it is important to create a European bank for seeds to store and maintain the genetic variety of traditional plants and combat the current loss of biodiversity in traditional varieties.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, I should like to point out that rational use of inputs and resources requires far more than the application of rules. It requires a change of attitude, knowledge and skills on the part of farmers, so that they can adopt the most productive, viable and innovative cultivation systems under the circumstances. As we all understand, that depends on both innovative and institutional improvements and a high standard of training. I trust that the new common agricultural policy will take all this into account.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to praise Mr Bové for the work he has done. Now, I would like to talk in very simplified terms, that is to say, my message is perhaps not directed at my fellow Members, but at those who are currently buying their own food.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The big problem for the EU’s farmers, and perhaps their only economic problem, is that they are shamelessly poorly paid for their work. The input chain is extremely large and, I would like to point out, extremely profitable. The food industry is reasonably profitable, and in the trading chain, it is, in fact, quite easy these days to become a prosperous small business.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the midst of this gigantic chain is the individual farmer, and even if we regard him or her as a large farmer, he or she is an almost invisible link in the large food supply chain, despite the fact that it is the farmer who is the really important converter of inputs into raw materials for the next link in the chain.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to ask you to imagine for a moment that if farmers were sufficiently well paid for what they sold on the market, then the EU’s income subsidies could, in fact, be converted into investment capital for rural development, the environment, climate change, animal care and infrastructure. Think what resources we would have available to us the day that farmers were paid a reasonable amount for the work they do!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will be no exception in congratulating my colleague, José Bové, for this very timely and very powerful report. It pulls together a number of the interlocking and mutually reinforcing factors which are impacting on our food supply chain and making the lives of European and global farmers more difficult. Indeed, there are times when the economics of farming are not so much a science as more of a voodoo cult. It is amazing that anybody is actually in farming at all and that we have any food to eat.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that the increased concentration of market power downstream of farming, in processing industries, trade companies and supermarkets, and upstream of farming, in terms of increasing costs for fertilisers, energy, feed, seed, water, loans and land rent, is undermining the proper functioning of the food supply chain in Europe. Farmers are facing a squeeze between rising costs for input and low farm gate prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">For those colleagues – usually those not present in these debates – who have suggested that the free market is working, I have some statistics from the Scottish Agricultural College report on power in agriculture – actual statistics on market concentration – showing that four companies worldwide account for 75-90%, by some measures, of global grain trade, seven companies control all fertiliser supply, five companies share 68% of the global agrochemical market, and three companies control almost 50% of the proprietary seeds market. If you add to that the supermarkets’ and processors’ power, it really is surprising that our farmers are in business at all. So to those who would say that the free market in agriculture is working – well, prima facie, no it is not.</p>
      <p sl="en">We saw what happened – as other colleagues have mentioned – with the breakdown of the interbank lending market earlier in this economic crisis. It is the poorest who are hit hardest, and our citizens are very much in the frame for this. So I was delighted, Commissioner, to hear your fulsome presentation this morning, and I hope you will gather from this debate that this House is looking for more action from the Commission, not less. We are your ally in this and, if anything, we want to see more urgent activity from the Commission on the many issues raised in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want to see further action because this is not going to go away or get better. Quite the reverse – the market is concentrating further day by day in a world where we are increasingly seeing instability in energy prices, global instability and its political knock-on effects, and climate change making parts of the world wetter, parts of the world drier, and all of the world more climatically unstable. We are not going to see our food supply chain getting calmer.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to act on this urgently. CAP reform has never been more urgent and this report deserves to be absolutely fundamental in all our minds as we take forward the CAP reform project with you, Commissioner. We look forward to that effort.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, during the course of the previous term, we managed, in this House, to adopt a resolution calling for opposition to the abuse by major retail chains of their dominant position in respect to their consumers and, most importantly, in respect to farmers. I was one of the co-authors of this document and I remember that while organising a press conference after its adoption, some of the agricultural organisations that had supported the collection of signatures for the declaration even asked not to be mentioned publicly, fearing potential reprisal from major retail chains. This illustrates the scale of the problem. Both in EU law as well as in the law of the Member States, legal instruments exist which allow us to deal with the situation effectively, and these legal instruments should be applied.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to draw attention to distortions in competition which result from the unequal rights of our farmers. This manifests itself both in external competition, in the area of unequal standards and the higher requirements that our farmers face in comparison to importers, as well as in internal competition, in the area of unequal subsidies. This is a very serious problem, which also distorts the agricultural market of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, I should also like to commend Mr Bové on his report. One can sense that it has been drawn up by a real farmer, who feels the pain of farmers. For my own part, I should like to say that a situation has arisen throughout the world where agricultural products are now used both in food and in energy production. Grain is used for bioethanol, rape for biodiesel, maize for biogas, and so on. As a result, financial resources that used to circulate on the fossil fuel market are now also flowing into the food production sector and are causing excessive price fluctuations. In my view, the European Commission should, as a matter of urgency, pay more attention to these issues, and should, as swiftly as possible, develop a mechanism to prevent financial speculation on the food market based on this factor. Too little thought is being devoted to questions of increasing soil fertility. I think that the European Commission should draw up and adopt a package of administrative measures to increase farmers’ economic autonomy and use of the required resources. Honest, fair and economically justified direct payments are one of the possibilities for farmers to reduce the negative effect of fluctuations in the supply of resources on stability in agricultural production. The utmost attention must therefore be paid to these matters, and we must demand accountability. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, during my farming lifetime, I have seen wheat yields triple, and during my farming lifetime, I have seen sugar beet yields triple. In addition to that, those sugar beet have gone from being randomly monogerm to consistently monogerm, and all that is down to the efforts of plant breeders. They have to be rewarded for the work that they do. They are in great competition with other plant breeders and the farmer, I can assure you, is the most brutal customer of the lot. If he does not like a variety, he will drop it like a stone. The price of failure for a plant breeder is very high indeed: it is 10 years’ work straight down the drain.</p>
      <p sl="en">Somebody was talking about maintaining seed banks. I can assure you that the seed breeders themselves do that. Actually, seed is one of the farm inputs that farmers have a huge degree of control over, and in the UK, a farmer has three choices. He can either maintain an old variety on which no royalty is payable, or he can multiply up a new variety. He will then have to declare that he has done so and pay a modest acreage royalty. He can expect to be inspected, or he can simply buy a bag of seed where the royalty is part of the price. All of these things he can do. This works well in the UK. I do not see the necessity to call on the Commission to interfere in this in any way at all.</p>

      <p sl="en">I will give you an example of the market. I am an egg producer – free-range eggs. They were in surplus in 2011 – no subsidy on that. I accepted the discipline of my packer and I reduced my production to squeeze out the surplus. Because I did that and made the sacrifice, it worked and the packer then gave me cash compensation. That is the free market working, but farmers must accept discipline. It is no good running to the taxpayer the whole time.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, may I thank the rapporteur for his work on this issue and the focus that he brings to a wide variety of problems that farmers are facing today. Whilst the rapporteur highlights generally the problems in terms of cost of production versus farm gate prices, in Northern Ireland – despite these difficulties – agriculture continues to contribute to the economy. We have heard colleagues say today that this really is quite a miracle, given the problems that farmers face.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland has grown significantly, accounts for 20% of sales from the manufacturing industry and now, in a very small region, provides 50 000 direct jobs. We should recognise the absolute importance of this industry to our economy. It is an industry which has proved resilient in difficult economic conditions and should provide further private-sector growth if given the proper support and freedom from oppressive legislation. There is no doubt that many of the issues raised by the report are valuable, but I believe that the greatest contribution that we can make to a sustainable and competitive sector is in producing a common agricultural policy that sees food production and European food security as its aim and objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over recent weeks, I have been talking to farmers in my own constituency and they see the proposals from the Commission as complex, overbearing in terms of environmental objectives and favouring landowners over active food-producing farmers. In our discussions on CAP reform, if we miss the opportunity to provide an environment for increased productivity and one which provides food and supply security, we will only continue to increase price volatility for farmers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, Commissioner, I was interested in your brief run-down on some of the common agricultural policy proposals. You mentioned specifically crop rotation, as has been envisaged in the Pillar One proposal. In Northern Ireland, this is seen as much too prescriptive and almost certainly will put small mixed farms out of work. It is simply not workable.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my own country, can I urge the UK Government to get on with its plans for the supermarket ombudsman and to give that ombudsman a range of powers which will actually tackle the issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bové for his report and Ms Patrão Neves for the initiative for this motion for a resolution today. There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg.</p>
      <p sl="de">You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food.</p>
      <p sl="de">What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the report by Mr Bové, whom I thank for his work, Europe is focusing decisively on establishing a legislative framework to ensure fairness and greater transparency in relations within the agri-food industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a very timely debate, and I would add my congratulations to José Bové for a well balanced report that highlights the real problems that farmers face because, as other speakers have pointed out, on the one hand, farmers are selling their produce to a handful of very powerful multinational retailers, and, on the other hand, they are purchasing their inputs from a handful of very powerful agrochemical or agro-industry multinational suppliers. The result, of course, is that farmers are squeezed from both sides by these huge and powerful companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">This highlights the urgent need for action in the CAP reform and in other areas where the Commission is taking action to try and help this matter. We need to strengthen the hand of farmers when it comes to negotiating (a) with the retailers, and (b) with their input suppliers. If we can achieve that, what will then happen is a better return for farmers, a better margin, and less reliance on the need for taxpayers’ support in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one particular area that I think needs immediate action from the Commission, and that is in regard to the fertiliser market. If I could give you the example, Commissioner, of the UK fertiliser market, there is a monopoly manufacturer for nitrogen fertiliser called GrowHow. It is 50% owned by its largest competitor Yara, which is the largest fertiliser manufacturer in the world. The other half of GrowHow is owned by CF Industries, which is the largest manufacturer of nitrogen-based fertilisers in North America. Surely this level of consolidation means there is little real competition in the UK marketplace. I suspect this is replicated throughout the rest of Europe. The only competition they face is from the blenders, but they, unfortunately, have to buy their nitrogen from that same supplier.</p>
      <p sl="en">So between 2003 and 2009, output prices for agricultural products increased by 35%, their inputs increased by 42%, but fertiliser increased by 173%. That is evidence that the market is failing. Commissioner, could you give me a guarantee that you will investigate this matter and ask the Competition Commissioner to look closely at how the fertiliser market is operating in the EU?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as early as 2010, we adopted a report by José Bové which focused on the market players to whom farmers sell their produce: the processing and distribution industries. Now we are turning our attention further up the supply chain, with rising commodity prices on the one hand and, on the other, farmers’ increasing dependence on a highly concentrated supply sector. Mr Lyon spoke about this just now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The latest Bové report extends a helping hand to active farmers and it sets out a strategy for an agricultural policy that is more socially responsible and that ensures a decent income for farmers. It is also a policy that is greener. A policy with an even greater concern for sustainable agricultural practices. A policy that also makes a concrete contribution to the fight against climate change. A policy that is also directed against the ruthless monopolies of seed and food giants.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, European agriculture is going through a difficult period because, among other things, the entire EU has expanded dramatically over the past decade through the accession of new Member States. Competition on the agricultural market has grown considerably, and all farmers in Europe are now feeling the competitive pressure. Many of them are coping well with this, but some are unable to face the pressure and are gradually leaving the sector. This is natural and proper, however, and any effort to prevent it would, in my view, be doomed to fail. We must, on the contrary, assist the agricultural sector by removing the unnecessary regulations and quotas which hinder agricultural development. Ending the quotas and ceilings on wine, milk, sugar and other items will also provide an opportunity for growth in the agricultural sector. It is these quotas that are a barrier to the growth of European agriculture, and it is also necessary to facilitate the operation of alternative distribution channels, such as farm sales or the farmers’ markets that have seen successfully rising sales in the Czech Republic and elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in an effort to keep the prices of agricultural produce stable, we are looking for a variety of measures that could eliminate the adverse impact of rising input prices on agricultural production.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In view of the fact that we cannot realistically maintain prices in respect of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds or water at a stable level in the long term, I am under no illusions that our efforts would be successful. In an open market environment, it is always justified that higher input prices and production costs are reflected in the cost price of the product. I therefore think that, in our efforts to solve the problems of the food chain, we should focus more on addressing the imbalances and inequalities in the relationship between agricultural primary production and the processing sector or retail chains, because it is in this area in particular that the most significant price distortions occur, to the detriment of primary production.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I do not claim that all is well in the area of inputs for agricultural enterprises, such as the supply of seeds. In my opinion, however, the most significant price distortions are in the chain between primary production and processors or trade.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I find it very positive that we are now looking into the problems upstream of farm production in a new own-initiative report. In so doing, I believe that we should pay particular attention to the reduction of input costs. It is a well-known fact that, over recent years, these have risen disproportionately in relation to agricultural earnings. Thus, for example, energy costs in agriculture rose by around 60% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices only rose by 25%. The rapporteur’s suggestion of setting up a price monitoring agency is certainly the right way to go. We have to succeed in increasing competition in the input sector, thus bringing about more attractive prices for farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is well known that farmers, for their part, are already attempting to work together more closely in a number of areas and thus exploit their potential when it comes to efficiency savings. In the medium and the long term, however, it will be necessary to provide farmers – especially those who farm organically – with a better price environment for their products so that we can ensure their long-term survival, especially in outlying alpine regions.</p>

We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards.</p>
      <p sl="es">Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, this is not the first time we have debated inequality within food supply chains and, whether we are talking about farm input or the final product, primary producers are always the weak link.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are currently in the middle of a debate on CAP reform, and the greatest worry for the sector is the serious problem in terms of prices. Production costs are rising higher and higher and producers are unable to pass them on in their prices.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason, it is necessary, at Community level, to strengthen existing legislation on agricultural contracts, inter-branch organisations and producers’ organisations, as well as promoting instruments such as price observatories, which analyse the price formation process through an analysis of costs, processes and margins, and, of course, to find a balance between the regulation of the agri-food sector and competition rules.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this connection, I want to highlight how essential it is that the Commission adapts the scope and application of these rules with regard to agriculture so that producers or their inter-branch organisations can effectively improve their negotiating position.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need functioning markets with scope for competition in Europe. We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene.</p>
      <p sl="de">Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so. Agriculture cannot be excepted from this principle. Only a balance of freedom and responsibility will enable all market participants to make the most of their advantages and thus help bring about long-term growth and prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, our farmers are being squeezed between ever-rising input prices, on the one hand, and very tough competitive market conditions for agricultural commodities, on the other. Faced with this problem, the Commission has two options. They should be reluctant to regulate markets – that is usually heavy-handed and rarely effective – but they should offer encouragement and support to the industry by indicating best practice on all sides.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three things you can do here, Commissioner. Firstly, you should encourage farmers to cooperate with one another: by working together, they can exploit their strengths to buy inputs better, process production better and thereby add value. You can empower farmers by ensuring that there is transparent market information always available; and you can enable farmers by amending competition law, promoting codes of conduct, illustrating best practice and simplifying the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am disappointed that the Commissioner’s proposals for CAP reform fail to recognise adequately the strategic importance of a viable, competitive agricultural sector.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first of all, congratulations on your re-election as Vice-President.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The distribution of value in the food supply chain is far from fair. Mr Bové’s report and the oral questions have touched on a sore spot. The primary producer is caught in the middle between highly concentrated suppliers of raw materials and powerful buyers. The primary producer cannot translate higher input costs into higher output prices. Primary producers remain a highly vulnerable group when it comes to distribution in the value chain and that is exactly why they need to forge a strong alliance, as Mr Ashworth said just now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Can the Commission clarify how much scope the legislation currently provides specifically for arrangements to recoup the cost of sustainability initiatives?

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Maria Patrão Neves for her excellent work. We welcome the general consensus reached on this text. The topic warranted it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For years, farmers’ share of revenue has been falling. As the statistics show, this decrease is not caused by one single entity, but by the producers’ lack of structural weight in the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of us have repeated this time and time again, but I do not know if that is good or bad. It has been said time and time again: we must give producers their deserved role in the food chain, one that is, above all, proportionate to their importance. The rules of competition should be applied in the same way to everyone and should not lead to this serious imbalance that we have highlighted. However, the reality is clearly very different. This unfair treatment is largely due to the diverse way in which the national competition authorities apply the European rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Members of the European Parliament, we see what is happening on the ground, we act as intermediaries and we can vouch for the difficulties encountered by many of our farmers or producers’ organisations when they want to unite in order to deal with processors, distributors and even their own competitors. As regards concentration, in particular, the definition of the relevant market varies from one country to another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When producers want to come together and combine their weight, some national competition authorities prevent them from doing so. They believe that the national market could not cope with that concentration and the significant weight of that new organisation. On the contrary, in other Member States, the opposite happens. Such groupings are authorised because the market taken into consideration, the supposedly relevant market, is the European market. Their weight is thus proportionally smaller and their position is not considered to be dominant. This situation is clearly untenable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission and the Court of Justice, as guardians of the Community’s legislation and its uniform application, must ensure that the national authorities do not keep producer organisations in an inferior position that puts a strain on their negotiating capacity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating José Bové on his excellent work, which clearly demonstrates the importance of keeping producers at the heart of the matter, for although we are well aware of the three stakeholders involved, namely, the producers, the large processing companies or small-scale processors, and the distributors, only the producers are suffering today. The two other large sectors are concentrated, highly concentrated in fact. That is the case for the distribution sector. Producers, however, are relatively deprived and very dispersed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore have to try to organise them as we have just done with the report on milk by Mr Nicholson. We tried to give them more power. I do not think that that is enough. In my view, there will be two important aspects. The first is that they will have to be organised but monitored by the public authority because – as one of my colleagues just said – we will need a body to monitor prices and margins as the public authority alone can ensure a balance between the various stakeholders. The second, in my opinion, is that we will have to stop treating competition as sacrosanct. What is important, above all, is the welfare of each of the stakeholders in the food chain, which ensures the welfare of all. That takes priority over the rules of competition.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is one of the great misconceptions of agriculture that higher food prices automatically translate into higher farm incomes. However, it is the experience of farmers in my own Member State, Ireland, that they are not getting fair play or a fair return in the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2010, average farm incomes in Ireland were EUR 17 700, or just over 50% of the average industrial wage. Since 2000, the cost of on-farm production has increased by over 37%, despite major efficiencies at farm level. At the same time, the price paid to farmers has increased by only 14%. I have no doubt that this imbalance is replicated for farmers right across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that primary producers are being squeezed from both sides of the food supply chain. On the one side, they receive low-grade farm gate prices due to the strong position of processors and retailers, and, on the other side, they pay high input prices due to increased concentration of input companies. Total input costs for EU farmers rose by almost 40% between 2000 and 2010 and costs continue to increase for farmers year on year. The upper pressure on these prices will rise further as a result of resource scarcity and a growing demand for food. On the other side of the chain, retailers have used their powers over farmers to implement a number of methods such as ‘hello money’, ‘pay to play money’, payment delays, shelf space pricing and carrying the costs of discount campaigns, which cut away at the returns of farmers and buy their produce in unfair and unbalanced conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is about fair return for fair work, making a viable living from work that brings added value to the environment, delivers food security and puts food on the table of the European citizens. The retailers, processors, food suppliers and consumers are key stakeholders in the food supply chain, but so is the farmer. I think we should remember that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the rising cost of food is of great concern, particularly at this time of economic hardship.</p>
      <p sl="en">From an economic and monetary affairs perspective, we will deal in detail with the issue of commodity derivatives, and agricultural markets in general, in the regulation on markets in financial instruments and the Market Abuse Regulation over the course of this year. We need, however, to ensure that our financial services legislation is joined up with our wider agricultural policies. The key will be transparency. Ultimately, we do not know what role financial market participants are playing in the world’s commodity markets because there is a lack of transparency in the trading process.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report makes clear just how many factors influence the price of food, yet it is easy for politicians directly to blame banks and hedge funds for price volatility. This is not a two-dimensional discussion, and the Commission needs to look for more sophisticated tools to remove the opacity in commodity markets and give financial regulators a full toolbox. They really need to clamp down on any abusive behaviour as and when it may occur.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, we need to proceed with caution, as food producers need to be able to continue to use agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge their business exposures. Financial participants should, however, reduce – not cause – volatility in our prices.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the extremely difficult situation facing agricultural producers puts the survival of many agricultural holdings at risk. Protecting the interests of farmers is therefore a matter which should be prioritised. We should focus, in particular, on small-scale family agricultural holdings as well as on holdings situated in Less Favoured Areas (LFA), especially mountainous or remote areas, where – due to the higher costs of production and energy used for transport or field work – the situation is particularly severe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As we know, the current situation is influenced by an increase in the price of raw materials, energy, fertilisers and other means of production. We also need to consider, however, the exceptionally powerful monopolistic activities prevalent in the market for means of production, the processing market and in trade. Therefore, I share the opinion that this issue should be dealt with by European and national competition bodies. I also support the initiatives aimed at increasing the transparency of farm input prices, as well as the European Food Prices Monitoring Tool set up by Eurostat. What we need is a strong legal system that monitors and regulates similar practices.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The agricultural market requires a degree of intervention. Given the specific character of agricultural production, which depends on weather conditions and biology, full self-regulation of the agricultural market is not feasible. All the more so, since the agricultural market has been the subject of increased speculation, the results of which we have felt very strongly. We should also develop local markets, food fairs and other forms of trade, which will shorten the chain from food producers to food consumers. This will not only positively influence the quality of agricultural produce, but also contribute to reduced prices and increased benefits for consumers as well as for agricultural producers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, for many years, I have been taking part in debates devoted to the difficult situation facing European Union farmers. Unfortunately, it is with regret that I have to say that many of the European Commission’s announcements heard in the last few years, also in this House, have not been put into effect to this day. Farmers were promised a long time ago that they would have special agreements, which would guarantee continuous collection of produce on the one hand, and suitable prices on the other. Equally, relations with suppliers are deteriorating continuously. The plight of farmers is truly tragic. Their attempts to achieve specialisation and higher productivity resulted in their becoming dependent on suppliers in recent years, with the latter dictating prices as well as payment and delivery deadlines. We have to change this situation. We hear words to this effect time and time again. I would like to put the following question to the European Commission: when exactly can we expect proper regulation with regard to agreements and contracts, on the one hand, and with regard to relations between farmers and suppliers, on the other?</p>

I would caution, however, against the race for erecting massive wind turbines on farms. In Scotland right now, the modern equivalent of snake oil salesmen are knocking on doors throughout the countryside trying to persuade hard-pressed farmers to part with vast sums of cash in exchange for having one of these industrial monsters erected on their land with the promise of pots of gold.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as the recent storms have demonstrated, these turbines are often subject to catastrophic failure, and even when they are working, they only produce a trickle of electricity. As a result, many farmers in Scotland have found that they have rusting hulks on their land which are earning nothing and costing them a fortune. Instead of having signs on farm gates that say ‘Beware of the bull’, farmers should have signs on their gates which say ‘Beware of the bullshit’!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the cost pressure to which our agricultural producers are exposed is enormous. Agricultural inputs – meaning seeds, fertilisers and animal feed, but also machinery – are getting ever more expensive. One of the biggest factors behind the rising costs, however, is energy costs. There is an urgent need for an action plan in the energy sector, not only in order to get to grips with the costs, but also to reduce dependence, and this urgent need is a call to action for all areas of politics. There is a major potential in renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower and biomass from sustainable raw materials. This renewable energy mix can fill the energy gap on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to mobilise all available resources, while at the same time increasing efficiency. Improved resource management in respect of humus and water, energy and nutrients cannot remain just an empty slogan.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another uncertainty factor for operators is the massive price fluctuations. Those running businesses need to be equipped to plan for the long term. A monitoring system for input prices could be helpful in that respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Excessive speculation on food commodities is an unacceptable factor. We cannot allow speculators to gamble on higher food prices. This problem is well enough known and it will not go away by itself. The effect of this can be felt by both agricultural producers, through low revenues, and consumers, through higher prices on the shop shelves. Higher food prices are not reflected in farming incomes. Instead, the beneficiaries are to be found at the end of the supply chain, which is to say, the processing industry and retailers. There needs to be a fair division of profits right along the production chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another cause of high costs that needs to be combated is Europe’s enormous dependence on supplies of raw materials and input products imported from third countries. We can only master the economic and environmental challenges and the extreme cost pressure in agriculture through long-term investment in raw material production, farm development, research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">These approaches must also be reflected in the reform of the common agricultural policy. The new common agricultural policy must enable farmers to achieve the full potential of their businesses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see this topic addressed in plenary and I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Bové. It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces.</p>
      <p sl="de">I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available.</p>
      <p sl="de">For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis and the fall in consumption have dealt yet another blow to farms and producers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem of farmers’ incomes is becoming ever more severe and is affecting small and medium-sized enterprises, the family-run businesses which do not have the strength to fight the arrogance of large retailers. Today, with this resolution, we are clearly saying that Europe must take action to correct these distortions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must ensure transparent contractual relations between producers and distributors in order to guarantee a decent, adequate income for those who work the soil. We must also prevent price fluctuations creating advantages for just a few, because currently, when prices rise, it is large retailers that profit, and when they fall, it is the farm workers that grow poorer. In order to achieve this, we must ensure that the industry becomes smaller and that there is fair competition within it.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not possible, as happens to me every Saturday, when I go shopping, to find extra virgin olive oil sold in the supermarket for EUR 2 per litre bottle when the price paid to producers by wholesale traders is EUR 2.35. Furthermore, we need transparency for consumers and clear information to guarantee quality against counterfeit products. Staying on the subject of extra virgin olive oil, we have asked, in a question that has received broad backing, for the level of alkyl esters and methyl esters to be reduced in order to prevent mixes of other oils, refined and deodorised, being added to oil sold as extra virgin. Placing these on the market contributes to driving down the price of high-quality oil.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, I hope that in relation to these points and this request for an amendment to Regulation No 61/2011 to reduce the levels of alkyl esters and methyl esters, you will make a clear and precise commitment on behalf of the Commission to reduce the presence of these counterfeit oils in extra virgin oil on the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, we must ensure that production costs are driven down. I welcome your openness, but I call for the idea to be endorsed in the next CAP of ensuring that renewable energy generation facilities be installed in every farm. These would be intended to provide for the energy requirements of the farm itself, reducing costs and CO2 emissions, and providing support to producers and small farms. What could be greener than a provision like this?</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, we must act quickly and take appropriate measures, because rural abandonment and soil desertification are no longer risks that need to be averted, but actual facts that need to be combated.</p>

      <p sl="de">I will start by discussing food prices. Over recent days, we have talked and talked about how a third of food in Europe finds its way, unused, into the rubbish. We have been discussing our failure to achieve the biodiversity targets. We have been talking about how we find ourselves in an energy crisis. We have been talking about the fact that many Europeans cannot afford food at the moment. We have also been talking – and quite rightly so – about how those who produce food can no longer make a living by doing so and how we can talk of a large-scale abandonment of farming in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we have in its place is a concentration in production, in production facilities and, above all, in retail. If I take Austria as an example, we can see that 77% of the retail trade is in the hands of just three companies. What we do not want to see, on the other hand, is a concentration of this kind in agriculture. We want to retain the biodiversity here, too, in terms of types of business. We need these opportunities to produce healthy, safe, hygienically sound food.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I must mention the draft resolution being debated. In my view, the key elements in this draft are those which concern improving the farmers’ position in a better internal organisation. Providing support to producer organisations is the soundest way to enable producers to sell their produce under decent terms. At the same time, I do not believe that we need to be wary about legislating on the food supply chain relationship as long as future legislation is based on objective factors. It is not reasonable for us to continue to rely on self-regulation of this relationship between farmers and retailers, at least at the moment, as borne out by the experiences so far. Farmers need specific measures and cannot afford to idly wait to go bankrupt.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I am advocating the adoption of paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution in its entirety, which is extremely reasonable and even envisages that future legislative measures have to be adopted only if they are absolutely necessary, and that these measures must not distort the smooth operation of the markets.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, it was a year ago in September that Parliament adopted the Bové report, following an in-depth debate in which I, as the individual in charge of this matter for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, was heavily involved, promoting meetings and debates with European-, national- and regional-level retail, industrial and farming organisations. The report included an exhaustive series of recommendations to the European Commission with a view to a fair income for farmers and a better-functioning food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In fact, since 2008, the Commission and Parliament have been producing communications, reports and recommendations, and establishing high-level forums and groups to solve this serious problem, without anything having changed in practice beyond increased awareness. We have returned to the subject and it needs to be said without hesitation that a significant proportion of the problems that farmers are experiencing result from the highly punitive behaviour imposed, above all, by modern retailers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The problems have been more than identified. What has been lacking in the Commission and the Member States is a genuine political will to implement solutions. Until we have that, farmers and consumers will continue to suffer harm.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this is not the first time we have discussed the highly lop-sided distribution of power and margins in the food production chain. If we are honest, the European Commission has been insulting this Parliament for many years by ignoring our demands. Yes, there is a high-level group, yes, there have been reports, but there have been no concrete initiatives. I am therefore happy with the Commissioner’s minor undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, who is it that is suffering because of that lack of action? It is the primary producer. On that score, it is rather telling that we have the Commissioner for Industry here with us. I have heard him speak about industry, about processing and about the competition between companies. However, where does the greatest unfairness in the production chain lie? Right there, in the relationship between the farmer, the primary producer, and the rest of the chain. He has not said anything about that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And to Mr Agnew, who finds this debate so important that he has already left the room, and all his colleagues from the British Conservative Party, who put the interests of the City of London, with its warped financial products, above the producers of their daily bread, I will tell you how the market really works. When a Dutch tomato producer, during the EHEC crisis, is confronted with a price drop of more than 50% – not through any fault of his own, but just as the result of silly remarks made by a German Minister – he is happy that at least he has a contract with a supermarket for a fixed and agreed price. What happens in reality, however, is that this supermarket – which by the way is German – then returns his tomatoes because it knows that in this crisis, it can force the producer to agree to a lower price.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This, Commissioner, is the way the market works at the moment, and if you had done your job, this would not be possible in a European internal market. This House talks about fair trade with third world countries, but fair trade starts at home, with a fair price for European producers. That is your job, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we have been talking about the imbalances in the food chain for a long time. However, the situation has remained unchanged. Farmers continue to be the victims of illegal contracts and unfair competition. In my country, food producers need to pay a duty to be able to sell their products in supermarkets, not to mention an additional shelf charge to ensure their products a high profile in stores. In addition, farmers only receive a tiny percentage of the profits which the large stores make after selling this farm produce. In the overwhelming majority of cases, good-quality products from small and medium-sized farms find it very difficult to gain access to consumers as these producers cannot cope with the competition or the conditions imposed by supermarkets. In Romania, farmers are forced to throw away a good proportion of the fruit or vegetables they produce as they cannot gain any benefit from them under current market conditions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Commission and Member States to provide farmers with a stronger negotiating position in the food chain, ensure that the competition rules in agriculture are observed, and encourage local markets.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the state should only intervene in market relationships when self-regulation fails. This also applies in the food sector. The supply of food to the European market has serious deficiencies that affect not only farmers, but also consumers. We also see, however, that the food sector is reacting to it. The affected parties, from farms to traders, are in a dialogue with the objective of defining unfair business practices. All participants assert that it is wrong and unfair to demand instruments such as standard contracts, payment and supply conditions and even payments for listing a product. They become unfair when they are used to abuse their market position. The self-regulation process is a dialogue between all stakeholders. For it to produce a result, we need a certain amount of time.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unless we take action to curb the increases in farm input prices, we run the risk of making it too expensive for our farmers – especially our smaller farmers – to operate. We cannot afford to price our farmers out of the market. Any such reduction in agricultural holdings would simply increase our dependency on external markets. This would be negative for Europe both in terms of the value of agriculture to the EU and in terms of the quality and safety of the food available to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agri-food industry and distribution represent 7% of total employment within the EU, and are worth EUR 1 200 billion per year – more than any other manufacturing sector in the EU. There is the further problem that food produced in third countries may not be of the same quality, and may not adhere to the same standards and rigorous health and safety provisions, as food which is produced within the EU. Given the importance of the agri-food industry to Europe, it is therefore vital that we protect farmers and thoroughly examine the issue of increasing farm output prices.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, this is something that has actually been discussed on many an occasion during this parliamentary term. If we now look at the results, what has happened? Of course, it is good that the matter is discussed, but I do hope that we will now really be able to get to grips with this problem, perhaps in connection with the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is clear that in many countries of the European Union, trade is very centralised and that has contributed to the disparities in farmers’ income formation and also put them in a bad light in these price negotiations. We must strengthen the position of farmers in talks, but also ensure that they enjoy a more stable income arrangement as a result.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr Bové’s report was also excellent. It is also evident that inputs have risen dramatically, and it should be possible for this to be reflected in prices. I hope that we will be able to address this issue in the context of the CAP reform.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if European farmers are to be competitive, even in their home markets, they must cut the cost of their inputs. Mr Bové was quite right to encourage farmers to cultivate their own seeds rather than relying on seed monopolies, and also to recycle phosphates and nitrogen rather than relying on ever more expensive purchases, and, of course, to return to the production of traditional products. He has also shown himself to be aware of the burden of the cost of complying with legislation – much of it, of course, EU legislation. He might have mentioned the costs of the new enriched poultry cages that have to be borne by countries complying with this very welcome legislation but not, of course, by those countries that have studiously ignored it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Certainly, the monopolies have to be tackled. Mr Smith and others have outlined instances of extraordinary monopolies that definitely must be tackled.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my colleague was right: we need fair conditions between the market participants. It is precisely those fair conditions that we do not have. On the other hand, we do have a social market economy. In other words, politicians are obliged, where there is a will so to do, to intervene and regulate.</p>
      <p sl="de">To do so, however, we would need a form of language that the market would understand. Poor prices for farmers must mean, quite simply, that we offer less in return. Then we have the problem of imbalance. Agriculture is made up of small actors – many operators – while the processing industry consists of medium-sized enterprises and the retail sector is highly concentrated. Put simply, things cannot work like that.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we definitely need, in my view, is strong interest groups and trade associations for agriculture that could regulate the market. In addition, farmers need interest groups and market information. They must also be allowed to reach price agreements. Anti-trust law thus also needs to be amended in favour of our agricultural industry.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, agriculture is, and will remain, a strategic sector in the European Union’s economy. In order to tackle future challenges and ensure a degree of consistency with interventions carried out in a particular region, we must first of all establish close links between agricultural policy, rural development policy and regional policy. With regard to the uneven response by food prices to the fluctuations in commodity prices, I think that this is mainly linked to the number of intermediaries operating throughout the supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am therefore in favour of adopting instruments which will be used to promote and support short supply chains and markets where farmers can sell their own produce directly. This will help establish a direct link between consumers and farmers in a particular region, enabling the latter to obtain a greater share of the value of the final price, while the general public will benefit from lower prices.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, following my first very long speech and this very long debate, and since we have not yet heard from Mr Bové, my closing speech will be quite short.</p>
      <p sl="es">After this tribute to the President, I will speak in my language, Italian.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to make a few points concerning the issue of prices.</p>
      <p sl="it">Regarding unfair commercial practices, the Commission is seeking to promote a consensual approach between the parties, and let me say again that this approach corresponds to the principle of good legislation that we have already welcomed thanks to this Parliament’s work on the Corazza Bildt report. I believe that we achieved good concrete results in this area in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission and the high-level forum on the agri-food industry, as I have said, will need to analyse the possible instruments for applying the guidelines contained in the document that you will receive. The sector’s representatives have committed to participating in a further phase of dialogue to draw up a proposal by mid-2012. As I have said, the Commission will have to decide whether to continue with efforts to find a solution based on dialogue or to take action through legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, the dialogue needs to be completed swiftly, and cannot be postponed indefinitely. That is why, if there is no reasonableness or a genuine wish to conclude the dialogue, we will be forced to take action. There will be no option, even though I always prefer an agreement rather than to take action through legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Late payment is another essential measure. I have said how strong my commitment is to ensuring that the directive on late payments be adopted swiftly, before the deadline set, which is the end of March 2013. I would like to say again that I have written to all the EU ministers of industry. Let me remind you that the directive sets deadlines not only between public authorities and enterprises, but also between large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, unless there are agreements between the parties, provided that these agreements are not harmful to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe that this directive, which forms an important part of the ‘Small Business Act’, can truly provide a response to the problems of small entrepreneurs in the agri-food industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">Next, to respond to your question on the need to move forward with an appropriate analysis of food prices in the EU, with a view to monitoring compliance with transparency, I would like to remind you of the important work done by Eurostat, the Commission’s statistical service, on the European food prices monitoring tool. This tool is based on the vital cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistical institutes within a specific working group in the high-level forum on the agri-food industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission is also working together with the other international organisations working on similar issues, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, because of the diversity of Europe’s food markets and the complexity of the factors influencing the prices paid by consumers, a detailed Europe-wide analysis of prices and margins is not realistic.</p>
      <p sl="it">This needs to be accomplished at national level, as is already happening in some Member States. That is why, through the forum that I have set up, we are trying to develop synergies between national price monitoring bodies, exchanging ideas and proposals, for instance, on the methodologies used.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the issue of competition, which was at the heart of several speeches during the debate, the Commission has put forward legislative proposals to improve the transparency of markets based on raw materials, including agricultural commodities. Specifically, these proposals concern over-the-counter derivatives, markets in financial instruments and market abuse, as I have said, and as you well know, these proposals are at the heart of the debate in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is one thing that I would like to ask Parliament. The proposals on derivatives, markets in financial instruments and market abuse are currently at the codecision stage. I believe that this House could give a positive response and could play a role of great importance.</p>
      <p sl="it">I was speaking about competition. The Directorate-General is working closely with the national authorities within the European competition network. These authorities are able to examine and impose penalties on anti-competitive activities in their national markets and, during recent years, many national authorities have carried out thorough investigations in the agriculture and food sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">That has made it possible to adopt significant penalty measures, many of which have related to abuse affecting farmers. The Commission will, however, soon publish a report on this subject and the European Parliament will, of course, be informed of it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Tajani will have noticed that when it comes to agriculture, the European Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that that is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense.</p>

      <p sl="en">Agriculture is facing an ever more complex situation. While the purchase costs of agricultural inputs such as energy, machinery, feed mixtures, fertilisers, pesticides, seed or water are rising sharply, farmers’ profits are stagnating. Agricultural activities consume large amounts of energy. Farmers are trying to maximise energy savings by insulating agricultural buildings, using alternative energy sources and so on. In view of the strategic position of agriculture for Europe, producing safe food and providing independent sustenance for the European population, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council to consider the options for setting maximum energy prices for primary agricultural production. The second financially burdensome input factor is the cost of fertilisers and soil improvers. There is room for improvement here on the part of farmers. Farmers have become accustomed to using large quantities of fertilisers. Restricting the massive use of chemicals will benefit soil ecosystems and help natural renewal. I would therefore like to urge greater use of natural fertilisers and the natural products that already exist in agriculture as by-products. I would also like to emphasise support for organic farming. The third fundamental problem for farmers is the rapidly rising cost of seed and planting stock. This worrying situation is caused by the massive purchasing of certified seed and the modest use of farm-saved seed. At the same time, farm-saved seed is economically advantageous and benefits the environment. I would like to call for the revision of all regulations restricting farmers in the use of their own seed.</p>

      <p sl="en">The widening gap between input and production costs and farm gate prices is not economically viable; for the younger generation, farming is not a viable option. Only 7% of Irish farmers are under 35 years old. We now have a world population of 7 billion; by 2027, it is projected that the world population will reach 8 billion and by 2046, 9 billion! This means that a decreasing number of farmers will have to double food production, while also battling climate change and maintaining food standards. The total input costs for EU farmers climbed by 40% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices have increased by only 25%. Farmers are living on their overdrafts or savings and that cannot continue. We need to ensure that farming is a real career choice for our young people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ever increasing production and agricultural input costs in conjunction with only marginally increasing farm gate prices have resulted in a drop in income for farmers. Statistics explicitly point to the increase in the prices of animal feed, seeds, fertilisers and plant protection products. At this point, I would like to emphasise the significance of energy. According to Eurostat, the price of energy, including electricity, gas and fuel, has increased by approximately 60% over the last 10 years. The construction of biogas plants and infrastructure that use wind, solar and geothermal energy undoubtedly involves significant expense. However, in the long term, this expense is certainly beneficial, as it increases income and has a positive impact on environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Practices aimed at saving energy and increasing energy efficiency must be encouraged and implemented in all holdings at local levels, either individually or through cooperation between neighbouring farmers. Moreover, engaging in cooperation aimed at better resource management and good farming practices will increase the bargaining power and market stability of farmers, which will, in turn, translate directly into higher incomes. Collaboration with research centres, reduction in protein deficit, systems for monitoring land prices and access to land are, of course, the remaining challenges, which must be tackled by the future common agricultural policy.</p>

Add to this the increase in operating costs for farms, which average 3.6% per year. The imbalance is aggravated further by the speculation on agricultural commodities. This situation, which affects both farmers and consumers, cannot continue. We must protect both producers and consumers by ensuring that the large-scale distribution sector does not take the lion’s share. I voted in favour of this resolution because it is our duty to bring stability to the European food chain and, with that in mind, to ensure a balanced distribution of profits as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Aldo Patriciello, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a space strategy for the European Union that benefits its citizens (2011/2148(INI)) (A7-0431/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="4-080-000" speaker_id="36392" name="Aldo PATRICIELLO" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Italy" birth_date="27-09-1957" birth_place="Venafro" m_state="IT">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, space has now become a pressing topic. This is demonstrated by the acute media interest in the launch of the first two Galileo satellites, which were launched on 21 October 2011 from the European base of Kourou, representing the first step in achieving European Union independence in satellite navigation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The achievement of this ambitious goal is, in large part, due to the impetus provided by Article 189 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which clearly and unequivocally gives the European Union responsibility for coordinating and consolidating national space policies and programmes through a joint approach in order to promote scientific and technical progress and industrial competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="it">This aim, laid down by the Treaty, recognises the importance of space and the services it generates for EU citizens in social, economic and strategic spheres, considering it essential to enable the European Union to compete on the world stage with its competitors. The treaty therefore provides an authoritative basis designed to achieve ambitious goals. The European institutions must allocate suitable resources and legislative instruments to do so.</p>
      <p sl="it">On this point, I have had the honour of working over recent months within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on drawing up the draft report on a space strategy for the European Union that benefits its citizens. I hope that the final version of the text will accurately reflect the ambitious proposals that we have tried to include in the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I refer, above all, to the different way in which the two strategic programmes in European space policy, Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), have been treated. While firmly endorsing the emphasis that the Commission has thus far placed on Galileo, one of the pillars of European space policy, I believe that, in light of the investments made so far, amounting to as much as EUR 3.5 billion, and the strategic importance of the programme, GMES deserves equal treatment in both economic and strategic terms.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced that only by developing both programmes in synergy will it be possible to ensure that our continent achieves technological and political independence, providing huge economic and social benefits to European citizens. That is why, in the report approved by the Committee on Industry, which we are to vote on shortly, I expressed my deep regret about the Commission’s decision not to include funding for GMES in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020, in the knowledge that the lack of a financing plan providing economic support could mean that the significant investment made to date has been fruitless.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important aspect to clarify is the strategy that the Commission decides to adopt on the management aspects of the Galileo and GMES programmes with a view to streamlining the organisational structure and having a precise framework for maintenance costs.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have also attempted to highlight, in the report, the need for Europe to ensure that it is independent with regard to access to space, and for commercial agreements concluded with third countries to be based on completely reciprocal relations, avoiding dependence on suppliers outside Europe in relation to certain key technologies such as launchers. The latter, together with the creation of a European space situational awareness system and the strengthening of research, are key elements in an ambitious text which we hope will give the answers that European citizens are waiting for.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to be far-sighted, European space policy cannot ignore support for industry. At a time like the present, when there is a deep economic crisis, it seems more vital than ever for the EU to provide economic support to the space industry with a view to maintaining our continent’s competitiveness within an increasingly competitive global system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Only if we provide European industry with real, tangible prospects will we be able to demand that industry invest in human resources and complex long-term technologies. Only if European industry maintains its leadership in space know-how will our continent be able to remain a leader in this crucial sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">As rapporteur on European space policy, this is direction that I have attempted to take. I hope that a convincing vote by Parliament will give force to a text which, in line with Article 189 of the new Treaty, provides for scientific and technological development in a sector whose sustainable growth is essential for the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, very often, we do not realise that space activity as well as space services and products are key to the economic growth and development of our societies. In my opinion, the aviation sector will be the biggest beneficiary of space technology. The Galileo and EGNOS programmes play a fundamental role in the creation of a Single European Sky, as well as in the further development of safe air traffic management in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am also convinced that space technology will contribute to an increase in the safety of road and sea transport, first and foremost in the context of road traffic management, road-use fee collection systems, eCall and real time tracking systems.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to make a short comment. The seven Space Councils to date have made only one reference to transport issues. Consequently, I would like to appeal to its members to display greater interest in this matter during …</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Union needs to invest to ensure guaranteed European access to space and orbital infrastructures. I should emphasise the importance of stepping up industrial cooperation with third countries in the field of space policy, especially with the United States, Japan, Russia, China, India, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, as well as with the countries of Africa and the Middle East. I should stress the importance of a research and innovation strategy for space policy, ensuring technological progress, industrial development and the EU’s competitiveness, and creating jobs across the EU. We call on the Commission to support small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining easier access to European funding earmarked for innovation in the area of GNSS applications and services, particularly based on the Framework Programmes of Research. The EGNOS system should cover the whole of the EU, with a view to consolidating the common market. I should emphasise the need to expand this system in southern, eastern and south-eastern Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the activities of the European Union relating to the exploitation of space focus primarily on the Galileo projects and the European Earth monitoring programme.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the near future, we can expect that the Galileo programme, in particular, will start to provide its first, initial services to the European public. As of 2014, for example, testing of the Safety-of-Life Service of this system should be launched. Given that the system is being built to be interoperable with both operating systems, GPS and Lonas, it will also be possible for it to participate in international cooperation relating to global navigation system programmes. In view of the fact that services in the area of space are growing rapidly and that the Galileo system provides certain advantages compared to competing systems, it may be expected that it will bring corresponding social and economic benefits in the near future. The Commission, however, must still answer the question of the further operation and financing of the European Earth monitoring programme after 2014, which has yet to be resolved. I therefore expect that our …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, political states that want to demonstrate that they have come of age plan achievements that are both monumental and symbolic. Spain achieved unity under Christian rulers in 1492, and within a year sent Christopher Columbus on a historic quest to discover a western route to the East and, of course, discovered the New World, the existence of which Donald Rumsfeld – had he been around – might have said we did not know that we did not know about.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is quite right to point out that great enterprises bring in their wake consequential benefits: new products, new knowledge, riches and inspiration for innovation, as well as a few detriments, of course. However, the real motivation is to confer authority and legitimacy on a political entity that might otherwise falter.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the words of the Commission, ‘space serves to cement the EU’s position as a major player on the international stage and contributes to the Union’s economic and political independence’. For the EU’s independence, read our slavery.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, within the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, we have very intense discussions about space strategy, especially in relation to security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union should be at the forefront of the space industry, playing a global strategic role.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to achieve this, I feel that the following points are absolutely crucial:</p>
      <p sl="ro">firstly, stepping up industrial cooperation with third countries too in the field of space policy. We need the United States, as well as Japan, China, India and other countries which are strong and play a particularly important role in this area;</p>
      <p sl="ro">we then need to attract a larger amount of private sector capital for GMES, the European Earth monitoring programme. This is a measure that has failed so far;</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, these are truly European items of infrastructure that are vital for implementing European policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is specifically for security, the environment and the management of mitigation policies, of global warming and the review of extreme meteorological events. It must be included in the European Union’s multiannual budget. If that is not possible, this may be the time to make use of project bonds, which also have an anti-recession function. I am convinced that this is an investment in our future and that it will pay dividends in a very few years’ time. Commissioner, let us go forward along this path.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, I believe that space policy is a priority in my mandate as a Commissioner, both as regards the services that can be provided and which are already beginning to be provided to the EU’s citizens, and because I believe that the sector of industry and enterprises – since there are thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises operating in this sector – is at the heart of what we call the third industrial revolution. What I mean by that is industrial policy of a kind that can enable Europe to focus its growth and development on the internal market and, therefore, the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Concrete results have been obtained. I thank Mr Patriciello for the work that he has done together with his fellow Members and I thank Parliament as a whole, as well as Mr Prodi, for his strong support for the Commission’s policy. We are in perfect harmony when we call for a truly competitive space policy for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I was saying, significant results have been achieved in recent months. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is beginning to be operational. In October, we launched Galileo’s first two operational satellites from Kourou in French Guiana. On the day of the launch itself, I started the procedure for the purchase of eight new satellites and, on 1 February, I will announce the results of the procurement procedure for the purchase of further Galileo satellites. So, this timescale and adherence to the forecasts have made it possible to save approximately EUR 500 million as compared with the forecasts made at the beginning of 2011 to the interinstitutional group and to this Parliament in the document on space policy that we presented.</p>
      <p sl="it">Galileo is progressing, and it is my intention to make Galileo’s services operational by the end of 2014 and to have the full system with 30 satellites, seeking to save as much money as possible and adhering to the deadline of the end of 2020.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, we provide for investments of approximately EUR 7 billion for the implementation of Galileo in the proposed financial forecasts that we have presented to Parliament and the Council. That is for implementation; approximately EUR 1 billion or so is for the launch of all the satellites and the rest is for maintenance and the full implementation of services, bearing in mind that the saving, once Galileo becomes operational, will be approximately EUR 90 billion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have also received Mr Patriciello’s message concerning Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). The Commission has adopted a communication, has made a proposal, and we believe that GMES should go forward. However, we have proposed setting up an ad hoc financing fund outside the EU budget, but within the EU. This would be a special agreement between the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also addressed this issue at the most recent Space Council, and I have spoken about it to the Competitiveness Council. Why have we made this proposal? It is because we know the situation of the budget. The European Commission and Parliament wished to see more ambitious choices by the Member States concerning the budget but, unfortunately, the response was not what we were expecting or hoping for.</p>
      <p sl="it">The outcome reached unfortunately means that we cannot include all the actions that we want to implement between 2014 and 2020 within the EU’s budget. That is why, in addition to being convinced of the importance of GMES as part of a European space policy, GMES, let me remind you, also enables us to strengthen our international connections.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have been through the signing of some agreements with countries in Latin America regarding space policy. During the Belgian Presidency, we did a lot of work with the African Union and we are continuing to do so on space policy, on GMES, and on observation of the earth.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, as things stand, there are problems linked to the budget. That is the starting point for the Commission’s choice. I must say that we believe so much in European space policy that in the financial framework, we have decided, from the large package of EUR 80 billion earmarked for research and innovation, to invest a significant amount in research and development in the space sector. This is therefore an added value that we wish to give to space policy as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need your support for this strategy and it seems to me that the speeches which followed Mr Patriciello’s report are indeed all supportive. I believe that cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission on space policy in the weeks, months and years ahead will continue to be strong and I believe that we will all be able to focus on the same objectives.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of European space policy is to improve the daily lives of the European public, foster potential for innovation, support scientific progress and create qualified jobs. That is why it plays an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy. It is currently facing challenges: implementing the flagship policies, cooperating and competing internationally, and boosting the present economic importance of services provided in the field of radionavigation. To this end, it is important to make full use of the potential of EU territory and of investments already made.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, I should like to stress the usefulness of the satellite station on Santa Maria Island in the Azores, whose activities relate to monitoring the oceans and space missions, like Galileo. The EU should be aware of the Azores’ location in the middle of the Atlantic and how this can be best exploited, in particular, by giving them new importance. I would also highlight the usefulness of creating space clusters. These not only contribute to the EU objectives that I have mentioned, but also to promotion of the local economy through the recruitment of highly qualified personnel, or through the necessary partnerships with local business, as has been happening in the Azores. This is another opportunity for stimulating indicators of convergence with the EU, particularly in the outermost regions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The European Space Programme, with the Galileo satellite navigation project at its head, has achieved some remarkable successes in the past year. The same applies to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme, which monitors climate change and security threats. Among the most significant successes are, above all, sending two satellites into space as part of the Galileo programme. At the same time, it is far from being just an expensive scientific whim. Both projects are of practical use in a range of areas, such as agriculture, transport, environmental protection and, of course, national security. What is more, the services linked to these programmes have enormous economic potential and create new jobs. The European space industry alone had a turnover of EUR 5.4 billion last year, employing 31 000 workers. The space programme, however, just like other research programmes, is threatened with budget cuts. In restricting these projects, the EU would surrender many opportunities for economic growth, particularly in the future, and I would therefore like to support adequate funding of the space programme in the multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European space strategy must serve both the economy and basic research. That is why it is crucially important that, in addition to the grand implementation of flagship projects such as Galileo, we invest adequately in basic research as, beyond dispute, it is a major investment in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">From the point of view of Europe’s values and prestige, it is not appropriate to become a freeloader with regard to science. Space research is the privilege to discover the universe that mankind inhabits, and one that might even be regarded as his responsibility and, here, Europe must set an example. Obviously, however, the money invested in research must correlate with the added value that research brings to science. This being the case, the cost-effectiveness of projects should be borne in mind, in addition to which there needs to be agreement with other noteworthy agencies and actors on international collaboration and division of labour.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The importance, in terms of security policy, of an independent navigation satellite system cannot be exaggerated. It is vitally important for the border guard, the military, crisis management troops and disaster relief personnel to be in possession of the details of their position, regardless of the global policy situation. However, GPS cooperation with NATO and, in particular, the United States must continue in a positive spirit, with the options for a partial coordination of systems being kept open. Europe is excellently qualified for space research, having educated people, a launching site close to the equator, and a strong values base. It only lacks, as in many other respects, the courage and drive to hold the position it deserves in the global context.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Salvatore Caronna, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on how to avoid food wastage: strategies for a more efficient food chain in the EU (2011/2175(INI)) (A7-0430/2011).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I should like to tell you, Mr Caronna, that this morning, the television news, in my country at least, was reporting extensively on the item that we are going to discuss today and I am sure that that was the case in other European countries as well. We are therefore dealing with a subject which has generated interest amongst the public, something that our debates rarely achieve.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation during the drafting of this report.</p>
      <p sl="it">This fruitful collaboration meant that we were able, swiftly and almost unanimously, to approve a text on an issue, that of the waste of food, which has, for too long, been underestimated by the institutions and by policy. We can no longer permit ourselves to underestimate it.</p>
      <p sl="it">All the most authoritative specialist sources now say that one of the main problems in the immediate future will be to tackle the new and extremely high demand for food and that therefore, the issue of food security has become one of the most difficult problems to tackle because, in the future, the demand for food will tend to exceed supply. If this is true, we can no longer allow ourselves to remain passive in the face of food waste. When we talk of food, we are talking of food that is still perfectly edible, and so this issue has become a large-scale problem which is no longer sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that a third of food produced every year in the world that is intended for human consumption is wasted, and in Europe, the figure is already 50%, with every citizen on average wasting 105 kilograms per year. We have reached such a level, in fact, that we have to say that we are faced not only with an ethical problem, but with a real economic and social issue, with enormous implications for the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why, through this report, we want combating food waste to become a priority on the European Union’s policy agenda. We are therefore asking for the Commission to lead the 27 Member States in adopting a common strategy that can foster a real step change to reduce food waste significantly by 2025.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore ask that all the associations, volunteer groups and initiative-taking centres that have produced specific projects in this area in various countries should be turned to good account. These experiences have generated a virtuous system which has guaranteed significant recovery of products to be sent to those sections of the population that are experiencing financial difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to remind you that in Europe, wealthy Europe, nearly 70 million citizens live under the poverty threshold and suffer from malnutrition. We are therefore asking for precise directives from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">Specifically, it would be important to amend the regulations on public procurement for catering services in canteens and hospitals so that, when they are being considered, priority is given, other terms being equal, to those enterprises that have a management model established on combating food waste. On this aspect, I would like to point out that the important fact is that the first to set an example should be the European institutions, starting with this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, we are calling for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to take responsibility. A real awareness-raising campaign needs to be conducted, targeted firstly at the large farmers’ organisations, the world of industry, schools and universities, which can produce a civil and scientific culture oriented towards a more restrained and environmentally sustainable model of consumption.</p>
      <p sl="it">With this report, the European Parliament has done its part. Now we hope that the Commission will address this work by putting an effective strategy in train. Above all, we hope that swift action will be taken to declare 2014 the European Year against Food Waste; this would be a tangible sign of the institution’s true, strong and immediate commitment in this area.</p>
      <p sl="it">This would give an immediate signal to all citizens that the European Union is able to be at the forefront in establishing a fairer and balanced development model.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow food waste to increase any more, and we must combat it with special instruments, as well as through a culture designed to illustrate its economic, environmental and social effects.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the last 30 years, food waste has grown by 50%, with consequences that are not only ethical but also economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health-related. It does not seem ethically sustainable that, in the face of the 70 million people, approximately, living in Europe under the poverty threshold, tonnes of food which is still edible are being thrown into the rubbish bin, or that the materials used for the production and packaging of this food are not being sorted as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">This waste, therefore, entails high economic and social costs. The proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cover spheres which, from packaging to more detailed information on the expiry date, are aimed at helping citizens to avoid waste and to reuse products.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, annual food waste generation in the 27 Member States is estimated at roughly 179 kilograms per capita. However, 79 million people in the European Union live below the poverty line, and 16 million of them have received food aid from charitable institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Food security is a basic human right that is achieved through the availability, accessibility and temporal stability of healthy, sufficient, adequate and nutritious food. The issue of food waste should be addressed from the standpoint of resource efficiency. We call on the Commission to launch specific initiatives targeting food waste under the Resource-Efficient Europe initiative in order to ensure that the same attention is focused on this and that awareness is also raised about energy efficiency, since both are equally important for the environment and …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, food wastage is a very important problem and it is a good thing that the European Parliament is dealing with this issue, especially in the context of dramatic forecasts relating to food availability in the coming decades, and the enormous increase in demand for food. The wastage problem is closely related to what we have been discussing about an hour ago, namely, the trade concentration; the fact that the greater part of the food product trade is being taken over by large retail chains. This obviously results in increased food wastage, if only for the fact that, as a rule, more food is purchased in a supermarket than in a small local shop. Therefore, this matter is particularly important. While considering food wastage, we should not forget about land wastage. The food crisis also stems from the fact that ever increasing amounts of land are being excluded from agricultural production. This is a very dangerous process.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I consider the 90%, up to 115 kg, of food wasted per capita per year to be a sufficiently compelling reason for food waste to become a political priority. Continuing the present rate of waste in the agricultural food chain is not only unsustainable in the long term and irresponsible towards the poorest sections of the population, but also has negative effects on the environment and causes large losses for business and the economy. The rationalisation of production, storage, processing and subsequent distribution and consumption, in which the EU annually loses up to 50% of healthy, usable and edible food, therefore requires a comprehensive European strategy to be drawn up. Surely the 70 million Europeans who live below the poverty line …</p>

It seems to me that it would be an excellent idea to focus our attention on this issue and the year dedicated to it – we proposed 2014. This would be quite sensible. It is also an election year and it is a very practical issue that we can talk about with our citizens. This is not simply about the food we throw out at home: there is huge waste in this institution, I dare say, in hospitals, in public places and right through the food chain.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the world population reached seven billion last year and it is expected to reach more than nine billion by 2050. Because of this, it is vital that we consider the issue of food security and of ensuring that we can produce enough food to feed our growing populations. In focusing on producing enough food for people, we must also look at how we use the food we produce and, to that end, we must also focus on food waste.</p>
      <p sl="en">Food waste happens at all points of the food chain – at the level of production, at the point of sale and at the point of consumption. However, the points at which food waste typically occurs differ depending on the country. In industrialised countries, most waste is concentrated at the final stages, in distribution and consumption.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Ireland, it is estimated that up to a third of the food we buy ends up in the bin, potentially costing families more than EUR 1 000 per year. The website stopfoodwaste.ie was set up under the National Waste Prevention Programme to educate people about the issue and to promote awareness of measures to prevent food waste.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We should not forget that Europe is much more dependent on land beyond its borders for its food than any other region in the world, using 640 million hectares every year, which is equivalent to one and a half times the area of its own land. Almost 60% of the land used to meet Europe’s needs is actually located in other parts of the world, with an area 10 times bigger than Germany’s, for instance. This again raises the question about what we should do: do we use more land, look for more land elsewhere or use the available resources as efficiently as possible?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, at a time of crisis and economising, the fact cannot be ignored that up to half of the food produced becomes waste before it reaches the consumer. I would like to thank the rapporteur for opening this topic on the floor of Parliament. Some of the blame for the current situation must be borne by legislation. The obligation of producers to state a best before date and expiry date results in 18% of food ending up as waste simply because people do not consider it to be safe. In some countries, the law does not permit the prices of products to be reduced below cost price, even on their expiry date. This must change. It is a pity that the report does not mention food banks. These non-profit organisations try to replace the wastage of food with its distribution to those who need it the most. We throw food into the bin while the European Union pays for food aid. Let us support the food banks instead.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, we currently throw away a quarter of the food that we take home in our shopping bags in Sweden. That is morally unacceptable and it is also unacceptable from the point of view of the environment and the economy. All of us can do something about this in our kitchens, our homes and when we buy food.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our role is to highlight the debate, raise awareness and disseminate accurate information. The Commission must provide clarification with regard to date labelling. The ‘best before’ date relates to quality, not safety. More labelling would instead confuse consumers. Lower temperatures in the supply chain for refrigerated foods would also increase durability. I have also been a driving force when it comes to getting the industry to take its share of the responsibility to a greater extent. They meet millions of people every day.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need to return to the farming culture that entails us using our common sense, being careful with our food and reusing leftovers. Instead, we currently live in a plastic culture. I hope that together, we will be able to change that. That is a challenge.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see Mr Swoboda sitting in his seat. I want to wish him the very best in his new role. Of course, I also want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caronna, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on the Internal Market for this report. I thank them, too, on behalf of Mr Cioloş, the Commissioner responsible for agricultural policy, who is in Dublin to present the common agricultural policy in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given its negative effects, especially for the environment and food safety, the issue of food waste is clearly receiving more and more attention. In this context, I must also mention the conference held in the European Parliament on 28 October 2010. What can we do at EU level? The Commission, which has already adopted a number of proposals, is currently drawing up additional proposals that will help to tackle the problem of food waste at various levels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have already mentioned the CAP reform, which focuses mainly on the production and processing stages of the food supply chain. The existing measures aimed at improving the sustainability of the agricultural sector, such as the agri-environmental measures, will be maintained. Additional measures will be introduced to respond to other recommendations in the report, such as the possibility of including in the rural development programmes thematic sub-programmes to support small holdings and promote the creation of short supply chains. The issue here is food miles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is also in the process of developing a European Innovation Partnership on agricultural productivity and sustainability, which aims to promote sustainable agriculture that obtains better results with fewer resources. The high-level fora looking at ways of improving the functioning of the food supply chain, which we discussed this morning, are also examining ways of optimising food packaging and minimising food waste as far as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission uses platforms such as the EU Retail Forum for Sustainability, the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production Round Table and an informal network of Member States to examine the issue of environmental sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, on 20 September, the Commission published a Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe, which aims to transform the European economy into a sustainable system by 2050. It states that food is one of the key sectors that could help us to achieve our goals in terms of efficient resource use. The road map thus lays down the ambitious target of halving edible food waste in the European Union by 2020 and reducing by 20% the food chain’s resource inputs by the same date. This issue appears in the report’s recommendations. The road map also calls for the preparation in 2013 of a communication on sustainable food in order to move this complex issue forward in a coherent and concrete manner. It recommends, too, that a methodology based on sustainability criteria be developed for key food commodities by 2014.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In paragraph 35 of your report, you ask the Commission and the Council to designate 2013 the ‘European Year against Food Waste’. My colleague, Commissioner Dalli, has examined this idea with your rapporteur because everyone is generally in agreement that we have to do something to combat food waste throughout the food chain. However, 2013 is too soon, firstly because in August, the Commission proposed designating 2013 the ‘European Year of Citizens’, and secondly because we need roughly two years to prepare fully all aspects of a European Year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we focus on 2014, which is what I took from this debate, it might be possible. I will forward your request to Mr Cioloş and Mr Dalli because I think that we could work together towards that goal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank all of you and the President for this debate, which is of great interest and great importance to us all.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report identifies the negative impact that food wastage has on the general population and, in particular, on people living near or below the poverty line. Food wastage occurs at each of the different stages of the food chain – most notably at the final stages of distribution and consumption. A change in practice, management and conduct at the various stages could both make industry more responsible and citizens more aware of this significant problem. We need a long-term action plan which will improve the entire supply chain and will focus on the ethical, economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health implications of food wastage in Europe and worldwide. Action needs to be taken at both national and European level to develop policies which will reduce waste while also improving food production practices in developing countries. The EU needs to address this salient issue in a spirit of cooperation, coordination and through the exchange of policy expertise to enable Europe to use food sustainably – from the moment of production to that of consumption.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It seems incredible that as much as 50% of the food in Europe goes to waste. At the same time, more than a billion people are starving in the world. Consumers must be able to purchase food in small packages. We also need to support locally sourced food, so that food does not spoil on its way to the shop. Locally sourced food benefits both the consumer and the producer. It is fresh, safe and produced in the consumer’s own country. It also boosts the viability of the local region. Locally sourced food is to be recommended.</p>

      <p sl="en">Food wastage, the poor health of the population and unused intellectual potential are only some of the manifestations of the current crisis. As far as food is concerned, humanity is now capable of producing enough food by non-traditional methods, from hydroponics to methods which do not resemble traditional animal and plant production at all. On the other hand, there are several billion people worldwide who make a living in the same way that countless past generations of their ancestors did, through primitive agriculture, with many of them routinely living on the brink of starvation. The world is full of irrational approaches, including the predominance of neoliberal economic schemes promoted by the most powerful countries in the world, but, at the same time, the world has a major problem with maintaining and improving the state of rural areas. The liquidation of food surpluses on the one hand, the effort towards at least slightly socially desirable steps, such as the programmes on consumption of fruit and milk products in schools, and, on the other hand, the possibility of making use – albeit not very rational use – of some types of plants for producing energy inputs shows that even a society as advanced as the EU has no recipe for solving these serious issues at present. Perhaps only a radical systemic change to the economic system across a major part of the world would bring a real solution. As this is not a realistic demand, we will at least support the declaration of 2013 as the European Year against Food Waste.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The world population is growing, resources are limited, and the poorest groups have inadequate access to food. On the other hand, perfectly usable food is being discarded all over the world: from losses during harvesting or storage, via transportation under conditions that are not particularly safe and errors during packaging, to the bad habits of consumers in the purchase and use of food products.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the last 40 years, global food waste has increased by 50%.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The production of food that we do not eat results in high costs from energy and natural resources, especially water, and greenhouse gas emissions. The approximately 89 million tonnes of food thrown away in Europe produces 170 million tonnes of CO2 per year. Apart from the environmental damage caused by food production, the costs of processing and disposing of the waste should be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="it">A study commissioned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reveals that 1.3 billion tonnes of food for human consumption are wasted every year.</p>
      <p sl="it">The study also shows that industrialised countries and developing countries waste approximately the same amount of food, 670 and 630 million tonnes respectively. Every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222 million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes). Fruits and vegetables have the highest wastage rates.</p>
      <p sl="it">The amount of food lost or wasted every year is equivalent to more than half of the world’s annual cereals crop (2.3 billion tonnes in 2009/2010). Education in schools and political initiatives are possible starting points for changing this behaviour, and could go so far as to also promote, together with other policies, the fight against metabolic diseases based on food.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is needed is a collective realisation that reduces the commercial value of the appearance and quantity of food, bringing it closer to the real needs of each consumer. This is a difficult challenge, but the European Union can manage it, as it has succeeded in the past with policies with a very strong social impact, such as the ban on smoking in public places.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I am delighted that we in the EU are at last focusing more attention on a crucial area of food policy, which is to say, food wastage. The report before us summarises well the main problems relating to the issue. This is not just an ethical challenge: food wastage has obvious links to reforms in the agricultural sector, social justice and the issue of hunger. It goes without saying that it is a totally absurd situation where 30-50% of food, depending on the estimate, ends up as waste. Moreover, more and more often, it is waste that is not used in any way.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The proposal in the report now before us that we should halve food waste by 2025 is extremely important, and I give it my full support. However, while we are pondering ways to reduce both waste at different stages of production and consumer waste, we must bear in mind the bigger picture. Agricultural policy is food policy. When this report is adopted, I hope that together we can start to think about how we will judge overall what sort of food policy we are promoting, and what sort of follow-up mechanisms to employ. Cutting food waste will be central to this task. The report’s proposal that 2013 should be declared the European Year against Food Waste would provide us with an excellent opportunity to engage with a more sustainable food policy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">According to the Stockholm International Water Institute, almost half of the global harvest is lost ‘between the field and the fork’. The setting of concrete targets and the mandatory collection of food waste in households and catering outlets is, in my opinion, key to ending this waste. This requires the collection of sufficient data on the amount of waste produced in individual Member States, so that an effective statistical comparison can then be drawn. The Commission must not delay with new legislative proposals and must start collecting the necessary data as quickly as possible. Up to 50% of edible and safe food is thrown out in European households, supermarkets and restaurants every year, while 79 million EU citizens live below the poverty line and 16 million are dependent on food aid from charities. According to studies published by the Commission, food waste will increase by 40% by 2020, unless effective steps are taken. The fact that we fail to consume more than one third of the food we cultivate is a problem not just from an ethical perspective, but also from an environmental perspective. Every tonne of food waste represents the equivalent of 4.5 tonnes of CO2 , the unnecessary consumption of water and energy, and the unnecessary use of agricultural land. If we planted trees everywhere where the crops that are never consumed are now cultivated, we would theoretically remove 100% of greenhouse emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to welcome Mr Caronna’s report against a background of increasingly heated debate about food security and sustainable agriculture. On a global scale, enough food is produced to meet food requirements. However, the problem lies in its unequal distribution and wastage. While people are dying of hunger in Africa, according to an FAO study in Europe, Europeans and North Americans waste between 95 and 115 kg of food per capita every year. I wish to take this opportunity to call on the Commission to promote public awareness campaigns about food wastage, and I urge both farmers and economic operators to take measures to prevent the wastage of agricultural produce in both the field and food chain.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Food wastage has reached such high levels that it may soon be recognised as a worldwide problem. Since the 1970s, it has increased by over 50% globally. Food is being wasted everywhere: from harvest time in the fields, throughout the processing industry and, finally and most significantly, in consumers’ homes. Europe and North America are the undisputed front-runners in this shameful competition. Annually, the inhabitants of these two continents waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. Within the European Union itself, this indicator is even higher. According to the European Commission’s statistical data, Europeans throw out 179 kilograms of food per capita, which annually amounts to approximately 89 million tonnes of permanently wasted food.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Contrary to popular belief, it is not overproduction that is the main cause of food wastage and – in the longer term – of hunger, but inadequate stock management and inappropriate marketing strategies aimed exclusively at maximising profit. It would appear however, that the factor that contributes most to the increase in waste is the placement of only one expiry date on labels, namely, the ‘best before’ date. Producers should be encouraged to place two pieces of information on labels. In other words, they should add a ‘use by’ date. The term ‘best before’ refers to the quality of the product, while the term ‘use by’ refers to its safety. This will help consumers make informed choices and, most importantly, prevent them from discarding food which is still edible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Food waste is getting worse every year, while raw materials are becoming scarcer and malnutrition is spreading throughout Europe. Some 89 million tonnes of food are disposed of each year (179 kg/year/person), yet most of it is safe and edible. I think we need to examine the causes of waste in order to reduce this phenomenon. We need to raise public awareness though European and national campaigns and, more specifically, teach children about this issue in schools. A double expiry date, with separate ‘sell by’ and ‘use by’ dates, would, for example, prevent food from being wasted. Use of this double label must, however, be accompanied by information for the customers, who must understand what it means. In my opinion, the European Union should promote a spirit of solidarity in the catering and large-scale distribution sectors to encourage them to redistribute free of charge to food banks or disadvantaged persons any unsold food that is still edible. If we do not react urgently to this situation, the people of Europe will not understand!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have often felt that this Chamber is out of touch with reality, but observing its reaction to the recent downgrades, I began to feel that lack of touch was toppling into clinical neurosis.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen the downgrading not only of our sovereign countries that make up the eurozone, but of the fund that is supposed to pay for all the bail-outs – and the reaction in this Chamber, as in the palaces and chanceries of Europe, is to try to turn off the volume, to stick fingers in ears, and to pretend that if the ratings agencies do not report what is happening, then there is not really a problem. We had Mr Brok claiming, in an interview in Die Welt , that it was all a wicked Anglo-Saxon plot against the euro, that the ratings agencies are not interested in making money, and that they are trying to drive the euro to destruction.</p>
      <p sl="en">My friends, there is no alternative to tackling the underlying problem. You cannot improve the weather by turning down the weather forecast.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in relation to the conclusions of the Council last month, I just wish to make the point that we in this Chamber delude ourselves if we think that we are the only democratic voice in Europe. We talk a great deal about the Community method but, in fact, we have to understand that this intergovernmental treaty is signed by 26 democratic governments accountable to their peoples. My government chose not to participate. We do not think it is good for Britain, nor for the eurozone, but we wish the eurozone well as it tries to sort out its problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say that the inclusion in our resolution of a reference to the financial transaction tax was entirely inappropriate. This is displacement activity.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, to explain the reasons for my vote, I would like to say that for many years in the not so distant past, we were discussing the Treaty of Lisbon. It also took us a long time to adopt it by means of various referendums, whereas now, instead of implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, thanks to decisions taken by certain governments, mainly the governments of France and Germany, we are beginning to pull out of many provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. At a time of crisis therefore, the Union is now moving back by a few years and a few kilometres. This is very wrong; since instead of strengthening the policies and institutions of the Union, instead of cooperating, we are slowly beginning to dismantle the post-Lisbon order. We have to oppose this decisively.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in voting against the resolution concerning the intergovernmental agreement, I am not voting against its content. I am voting against this Parliament taking a position on the agreement at all. This is not an EU Treaty and should therefore not be treated as one in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The crisis in the eurozone is continuing and it seems that most of the solutions that have been put forward so far via complicated regulations and ever more complex financial structures have not calmed the markets. An intergovernmental agreement could be faster to agree and simpler for the markets to understand if it were necessary, but as the most important aspects of this treaty are already included in a ‘six-pack’ on economic governance, I do not see any value in Parliament wasting its time on this rehashed agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">If it takes an intergovernmental treaty for Member States to live up to these commitments already in secondary EU legislation, then why are we wasting time legislating in this House? If Member States do not trust each other to deliver on agreed legislation, how can investors begin to trust them?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I fear the worst, and that once again, the EU is creating rules which no one has even any intention of obeying. This is the same sort of rule as when it was decided that Europe was the world’s most competitive area in 2010. I do not believe that the Member States will achieve a 0.5% deficit target. In my view, the most important thing at this stage would have been to establish a programme for achieving this, and, furthermore, there ought to have been more focus on growth and maintaining employment. The EU has not given any attention to how the tax havens can be abolished. How should taxes be collected in the Member States? Now we need real measures such as these.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I think that this position adopted by Parliament is highly important because it is among the European Parliament’s key principles that legislation is formulated, drafted and implemented in the context of the normal Community method, which guarantees transparency and the democratic process. If, for political reasons, we have arrived at a situation where the Member States are out of step with one another in principle, it is extremely important that we achieve implementation in the context of normal Community legislation. After all, we have legislation on the ‘six-pack’ and on the deficits now being discussed here in Parliament. In this way, we can implement what Member States want in the context of an entirely normal legislative procedure.</p>

I do not agree to this Parliament denying Member States the right to agree among themselves, as equal partners, in addressing urgent economic issues. If Europe is to overcome the crisis successfully, the Member States must regain the trust of the financial markets. The only real way of regaining trust is to take responsibility. Seeking other means, such as borrowing money for ineffective national and European projects, is the type of thinking that led us into the crisis. It is a road to new public debts, a road to hell. I cannot therefore support a resolution that promotes the establishment of project bonds, the introduction of a financial transaction tax, and stabilisation bonds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have been struck by the tone of a lot of the remarks in this Chamber since the recent summit to the effect that Britain is now disengaged from Europe, that we should simply go our own way, return to the sea and so on. They are often delivered in a rather disparaging tone, but I take them as a constructive basis for negotiation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It seems that if we are not going to be part of this new Treaty on Fiscal Union, this new FU Treaty, then it is logical that this should become the main forum for further integration. It should be, for example, the forum in which any tax harmonisation happens. It should indeed be not only the unit of economic governance, but of wider political amalgamation.</p>
      <p sl="en">This would leave Britain in, if you like, an outward shell of the EU which would have been drained of its substance, as the weasel was said to suck the contents out of an egg while leaving the shell untouched. It would still be called the European Union, but it would, in practice, have subsided into a free trade area bolstered by a little bit of intergovernmental cooperation. Would that not keep all sides happy? It would certainly please my constituents, and I put it to you, colleagues, that you would lose a bad and grudging tenant, but gain a good and friendly neighbour.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of the Florenz report. The past twenty years or so has seen an increasingly widespread ownership and proliferation of personal household and electrical equipment by our citizens, and technology continues to develop at a rapid rate to satisfy increasing demands for cutting-edge products. As a result, electrical hardware often becomes obsolete after a comparatively short shelf-life and needs discarding.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report makes out that only a third of such hardware is disposed of in the prescribed manner and recycled. This disposal figure needs to increase and Parliament must continue to support the Commission’s 2020 target of 65%, with an interim target of 45%. I particularly welcome the proposal for retailers to provide collection points for redundant small portable equipment – objects such as our mobile phones. The effect of the poisonous pollutants emanating from the avoidable, incorrect disposal of electronic goods does not respect national boundaries. We owe it to our citizens to have a clean environment throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>

Another positive aspect is the emphasis on retrieving strategic raw materials, in addition to the recovery, recycling and reuse activities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to emphasise the importance of the measures for raising the awareness of and informing the public. This will ensure the success of the waste management schemes. At the same time, I encourage the Commission to promote the exchange of good practices in this area. For example, the Romanian authorities have created a website offering complete information about collecting and recycling electrical and electronic equipment. Another measure was the launch of the national ‘Marea debarasare’ (Big Disposal) campaign in 2007. As a result of this annual event, several thousand tonnes of waste have been collected.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, waste electrical equipment is one of the fastest growing waste products in the European Union. We must do everything in our power to ensure that it is recycled professionally in order to be able to mitigate our loss of resources. In the interest of preventing environmental and health damage, we must seek to ensure appropriate collection. Impact assessments reveal that although 85% of these waste products are now collected in EU Member States, only 33% of them undergo appropriate processing. By preserving existing and tested systems, all actors involved in collection and treatment must engage in conduct that complies with the directive.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Experience so far has unfortunately shown that Member States differ in their interpretations of the present directive. We must strive to ensure that the new Member States, too, are able to catch up and follow the provisions of the directive. This also includes selective waste collection. Selective collection could also serve to reduce the extensive illegal transport of waste outside the EU. I believe that costs incurred during collection and treatment should be incorporated into product prices so as to serve as an incentive to reduce costs. I, too, voted in favour of this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report on waste electrical and electronic equipment seems to strike the right balance in terms of what should be decided at EU level and what should be left to Member States. For Wales, a key element will be the way in which the collection target will be calculated – the current method being kept until the end of 2013, after which there will be an interim target and then an ambitious target of 65% of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market from 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States such as my own will now have the choice of opting for a more ambitious 85% target should they wish to do so. Conversely, I welcome the proposal that the Commission will assist those Member States who are struggling to meet the targets, with transitional adjustments. While it is important to increase the amount of EEE being recycled and to reduce the waste, it is equally important that the approach should not be too prescriptive but should give Member States the flexibility to choose the most appropriate and achievable target for them. Delivering a positive result will now be up to the Member States: it will be up to them to demonstrate commitment turned into reality.</p>

In addition, with the retention of the two-step Biocidal Products Directive, the procedure particularly of assessing chemical active ingredients and the approval system that differentiates between the so-called ‘normal’ and ‘problematic’ substances will still remain in force. This is essential for the legislation to be effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe the labelling requirements introduced by the compromise package for those materials treated with biocides and the simplification of data protection rules to be positive steps. The mandatory data sharing mechanism is also important and has been put forward in the report. This would mean the avoidance of duplication of vertebrate animal studies and the use of more vivisection which, generally speaking, I reject. I feel that the report will make the rules surrounding the products a lot easier to understand and also to enforce throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report because biocidal products have a wide range of uses, including in the food, cosmetics and textile industries. As a result of this, their use needs to be closely regulated. Simpler authorisation procedures are required. A high level of health protection also needs to be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the centralised authorisation system will have a beneficial impact at European level. In addition, the measures on the comprehensive labelling of products treated with biocides are timely. They will enable consumers to be better informed and protected.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the attention being focused on the cumulative effects. At the moment, there is no single accepted definition or analysis criteria. In this regard, including the assessment method in the technical guidance notes presented by the Commission marks a step forward.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Parliament and the Member States today agreed a recasting of the EU Regulation on biocidal products. I very much welcome the fact that there will be EU-wide authorisation for biocidal products, and that non-European producers will also have to seek European authorisations. The result of that is that foreign manufacturers, too, will have to meet high European standards if they want to sell their products in Europe. From the point of view of the agricultural sector, however, it is important that biocides continue to be available for use by our farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">A good compromise has been achieved here, and it is one that facilitates the sustainable use of biocides and further reduces potential risks when they are used.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, maintaining the use of existing biocidal products in the absence of viable alternatives is vital for industry, households and our communities at large. This report balances usage requirements whilst upholding a high level of protection for human and animal health and the environment. It is important that the process of assessing the active ingredient and the subsequent authorisation of a biocidal product will be maintained at current standards to ensure the highest level of protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming from a background of biochemistry, I welcome that there will be a regular review of biocides, with the initial approval or subsequent renewals having a limit of 10 years. However, despite the report initially proposing a ban on all carcinogens, it is important that they will still be permitted to be used in a controlled manner particularly with regard to rodent control pesticides, which are widely used by the farming community in my region in Wales. Safe, regulated use is far preferable to an outright ban. I also support the rules for mutual recognition which will, of course, provide for a single market in biocides across the whole of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of the Bové report on the farm input supply chain. Given that farming is such a labour- and machinery-intensive, costly industry, and with ever-growing demand for food, it can sometimes be difficult for farmers to always make a profit and this report recognises this as fact.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is particularly good in that it also acknowledges that legislation imposed by the EU can and often does decrease the global competitiveness of the farms it is actually trying to help. One of the key elements of the report is the proposition that greening measures in pillar one should be made optional. These measures, which are part of the Commission’s draft legislation on the common agricultural policy post-2013, could pose difficulties to many of our farmers and place an extra unnecessary burden on the farming industry at a time when we should all be striving to implement measures that have exactly the opposite effect.</p>

I enthusiastically support this excellent report, which is based on the premise that we need measures at every step in the output chain, based on what is produced and how. Where does production take place? What are the transport arrangements? What sort of agricultural system is being supported? How, moreover, do the food production chain, restaurants and public procurement ensure that we use the valuable calorific and healthy nutritional resources occurring throughout Europe in the fairest possible way, while at the same time supporting targets for biodiversity and, furthermore, reducing the impact of food production on climate?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, farmers living in remote, mountain or isolated regions are hardest hit. Due to the difficult natural conditions, they need to invest more in transport and preserving products, while keeping their prices competitive.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today’s own-initiative report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development draws attention to an important problem in agriculture. This is that, in recent years, input and production costs have risen much more quickly than farm gate prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need fair conditions between all market participants. That is, of course, why we have a social market economy. A social market economy means that politicians need to get involved when these fair market conditions are not in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">One problem that we have in the agricultural sector is that we have a large number of farms and a processing industry made up mainly of medium-sized companies, whereas the retail sector at the end of the chain is highly concentrated into the hands of a small number of operators. The result of this, of course, is that it is the farmers, as the least organised of these sectors, who most often draw the short straw. As a result, we need a great increase in the number of interest groups to obtain market information and to be able to come to agreements about prices. Current anti-trust rules do not do justice to these needs and need to be amended accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of the Patriciello report; there are clear merits for the European Union to coordinate its efforts for a better EU space strategy. The combined technical expertise of all our scientists and engineers would serve to improve space technology that aids both the EU economy and improves the quality of life of our citizens. For example, the GPS satellites that millions of motorists rely on across Europe could be enhanced to give further accuracy and innovation for traffic management and secure the passage of merchant shipping, which delivers the bulk of imported goods to our European economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also support the EU’s Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, which aims to create a capacity for earth observation and the environmental benefits we would hope that it would eventually bestow. However, I support the report’s call for the GMES to be funded through the multiannual financial framework, which is preferable to the Commission’s wish that it be funded outside of the European Union budget, placing an added financial burden on Member States during these times of increased austerity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Lukashenko’s dictatorship in Belarus is sometimes described as the last surviving piece of Soviet apparatus in Europe, but I think that overlooks the common agricultural policy, with its central plans, with its state support of prices, with its regulation. We have rehearsed many times the case against the CAP, the terrible damage it does to developing countries, particularly in Africa, the way in which it falls disproportionately on the poorest, the inflationary effect it has on our economies through higher food prices, the distortion of incentives in the countryside, the way in which it particularly penalises countries such as mine which are net food importers.</p>
      <p sl="en">One thing which I think deserves more study is the way in which it funnels money to a particular kind of people in all the Member States – and they are not farmers, or at least not necessarily. The payments have become disconnected from the land. A lot of public sector institutions, NGOs and generally wealthy individuals are now receiving subsidy cheques from the European Union, and that, in a sense, is the point: we have purchased – or the EU has purchased – the loyalty of a powerful and articulate caste of people in every Member State.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted along with my group, the ECR, in favour of the changes suggested by the Caronna report. In the current economic crisis, with the global population increasing at its current rate and with widespread famine in Africa a major problem, the need to reduce food wastage has never been greater. Therefore, exchanging methods of best practice is important, as is better coordination between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the most important matters highlighted by the report is the fact that the rules concerning below-cost selling in our supermarkets are not the same throughout the European Union. It is important to allow retailers to sell food at discounted prices as it nears its ‘sell by’ date: this practice reduces food wastage significantly in countries such as the United Kingdom, where it is permitted. In some of our Member States, believe it or not, there is a ban on below-cost selling – absurdly making this sensible practice illegal. I hope that, with better coordination between Member States, this situation will change.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is essential that there be a common visa policy facilitating legitimate travel by third-country nationals and preventing the implementation of measures aimed at facilitating the process of lodging and processing visa applications: simplified issue procedure, reduced costs, use of visas for multiple entries, provision for more adequate periods of validity, etc. The Community Code on Visas, created in 2009, was the decisive factor in making the common visa policy more consistent, enabling the inclusion in a single Code of all provisions governing the issue of visas and decisions relating to refusal, extension, cancellation, revocation and shortening of visas issued.

This amendment to Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 concerns third-country nationals who hold a valid visa or residence permit issued by a Member State where the Schengen acquis has not been fully implemented, specifically, the United Kingdom, Cyprus, Ireland, Bulgaria and Romania. The amendment means nationals of these countries are exempt from the requirement of an airport transit visa.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for this report which slightly amends current EU legislation on visas. This is an extension of visa exemptions, particularly in the case of airport transit visas (ATV), as they often duplicate a single visa requirement. This technical amendment, which removes an administrative burden, has the virtue of facilitating the only freedom of movement that the European Union is struggling to implement: that of people. At a time when there is Fortress Europe, where capital alone is free to circulate without controls, I sincerely hope that this measure will resolve the situation of several thousand people.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is not necessary to re-check third-country citizens in possession of a valid visa from a Member State of the European Union by means of a transit visa, since the possible risk of illegal immigration has to be evaluated in advance as part of the visa-issuing process. An amendment of the regulation is therefore urgently needed, not least in order to cut the administrative expenditure of the authorities in the Member States.</p>

This agreement, aimed at mutually protecting geographical indications, is further proof of Georgia’s desire to extend its trade ties with us. Georgia has already been a party to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Therefore, it recognises the notion of GIs as place names used to identify the origin and quality, reputation or other characteristics of products. This agreement concerns agricultural products and foodstuffs originating in the territories of both Georgia and the EU, and endorses the protection of the characteristics of quality and origin of products coming from both partners. I can only support this initiative, which diversifies the European Union’s trade relations while protecting our producers.</p>

Under this agreement, both parties fulfilled a commitment provided for in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force on 1 July 1999, and its implementation was made possible by Georgia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2000. This agreement will be mutually beneficial. On the EU side, it should help ensure that around 820 food GIs, 1 930 wines and 320 spirits (from 23 Member States) registered by the EU will be protected in Georgia, which is very reassuring for EU agricultural production.

Accordingly, I cannot but approve of the text that has been negotiated, even though Georgia is not actually a problematic area in terms of the recognition of GIs in the agricultural and food sector. The areas that pose legislative and political obstacles to the progress of bilateral negotiations for the mutual protection and recognition of GIs are other ones entirely. This agreement ought therefore to be welcomed, but the hope is that this is only the first of a number of similar agreements to be negotiated, as soon as possible, with subjects that compete unfairly with European products on a serious and very substantial scale.

This agreement is comprehensive and compatible with commitments made under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement. As indicated in the European Parliament recommendation, the parties agree on the criteria and procedures applied to the registration of a GI on their territory, because new GIs can be added if neither party objects, and a Joint Committee consisting of representatives of both parties will be set up to monitor the agreement’s implementation and improve the terms of bilateral cooperation in the field of GIs.

Indeed, the EU started negotiations with Georgia in July 2010 over a bilateral association agreement which should have a trade component, that is to say, a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA). Before entering into negotiations on a DCFTA, the European Commission expects a set of key recommendations established as part of the Eastern Partnership and endorsed by the Council to be fulfilled by Georgia in order to ensure that this Eastern partner has the legal and institutional capacity to implement a DCFTA. The agreement on GIs therefore establishes the capacity of Georgia to negotiate and conclude with the EU substantial agreements on key, trade-related issues, including technical commitments.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Although the 18 GIs relating to Georgian wine making fall well short of Europe’s around 3 100 GIs, with 1 930 relating to wine alone, I hope that, by protecting its GIs, this agreement will work as a stimulus to greater promotion and perception of the quality of Georgian products in foreign markets, particularly those to which it does not traditionally export.

      <p sl="pt">In this report, Mr Moreira analyses the recommendation on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and Georgia on protection of geographical indications (GIs) of agricultural products and foodstuffs. Although Georgia only joined the World Trade Organisation in 2000, there has been a partnership and cooperation agreement between it and the EU since 1 July 1999. Following time-honoured traditions, the purpose of GIs is to identify the origin, quality and characteristics of given products, linking them to the region where they are produced, so as to guarantee their reputation. I voted for this draft recommendation because I believe that both Georgia and the EU, particularly their farmers, will benefit greatly, since they will see the characteristics of their products – cheeses, oils and fats, bread and pastry, fruit, vegetables, cereals, fresh meats and meat products, fresh fish and seafood, wines, spirits and beers – recognised and protected.

      <p sl="pt">Geographical indications (GIs) constitute an instrument intended to protect certain names that identify products with a special link to their region of origin. GIs are indications that identify a product as originating in a given territory, in which a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product can essentially be attributed to its geographic origin. In the current international context, marked by deregulation and liberalisation of world trade, by standardisation of production methods, by intensification and homogenisation of production, by the consequent loss of modes of production and traditional products, and by reductions in all types of biodiversity, GIs constitute an instrument that can help preserve and respect the characteristics and quality of certain local and regional products. We support the establishment of GIs for various agricultural products, such as cheeses, fruit, vegetables, cereals, meats, fish and seafood, bread and pastry, and wines and spirits originating in 23 EU countries and in Georgia. However, it should be remembered that this instrument is not a panacea for tackling the damage caused by trade deregulation. What is necessary, then, is calling into question the dogma of free trade. Regrettably, the rapporteur calls – in the same report – for the door to be opened to this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We should not only agree to sign the agreement with Georgia but we should also support it. The role of the more developed countries of the Union is to promote appropriate solutions among the countries which are only starting to grow their economies. Georgia’s case is a special one due to the county’s turbulent history – including the period when it constituted part of the Soviet Union – and ongoing ethnic conflicts. Georgia is a country of rich tradition, especially in terms of its cuisine and wine. The abundance of crops, local dishes and wines is beyond compare. As honest trade partners, we should therefore help Georgians to protect their unique produce, while at the same time promoting its high quality. Georgia’s wines are worthy of particular note. During the years of Georgia’s membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), wine was produced on a mass scale, with an adverse effect on quality. Now is the time to support the revival of Georgian wine, so as to encourage better development of this sector of the economy.</p>

Wine, in particular, which traditionally was exported mainly to Russia, is being produced more and more by European companies and distributed throughout the continent. In order to ensure the mutual protection of the geographical designations of most agricultural products – first amongst these, naturally, being wine – Georgia and the European Union signed an agreement back in 1999 that now forms the basis for other agreements with Georgia.

The European Union should strive to reach agreements like this with other countries as well, since they bring a range of benefits: on the one hand, we are protecting our best businesses from the dangers of counterfeiting and abuse, while on the other, we are helping the growth and development of neighbouring countries so that their citizens might have better living conditions and work opportunities, meaning they would not have to emigrate elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I support this agreement between the European Union and Georgia on the protection of geographical indications (GIs) of agricultural products and foodstuffs. This agreement will be mutually beneficial. Eight hundred and twenty food GIs, 1 930 wines and 320 spirits (from 23 Member States) registered by the EU will be protected in Georgia. Although Georgia does not yet have GIs relating to foodstuffs and the 18 registered indications only regard wines, it should be noted that in the long term, it will be possible to supplement the list of mutually recognised GIs. I believe that the agreement will help Georgia to increase diversification of export markets. At present, Georgia mostly exports to markets in Russia and other CIS countries, but the export of mineral water, wine and foodstuffs to EU markets is gradually increasing. The agreement should strengthen this upward trend, and will also help Georgia to fully integrate in the global system for the protection of intellectual property in the area of trade. The conclusion of the agreement on protection of geographical indications is a step towards the conclusion of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) between the EU and Georgia. I hope that negotiations on a DCFTA will begin soon. A further rapprochement in EU-Georgian trade relations is one of the main objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">The EU has an agreement with Georgia governing the mutual protection of geographical designations for numerous agricultural products such as cheese, oils and fats, bread and pastry, fruit, vegetables, cereals, fresh meats and meat products, fresh fish and seafood, wine, spirits and beer. With Georgia’s admission to the WTO, the country also became a contracting party to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). As a result, Georgia is obliged to recognise place names as geographical designations where they provide information about the origin and quality of a product. An agreement was concluded on this basis, in order to promote mutual trade in agricultural products and foodstuffs, in particular, Georgian wine. European companies have been increasingly investing in Georgian production of wines and spirits. The protection of geographical designations for agricultural products is of key importance for high-value products from the EU. This agreement, however, mainly supports Georgian wine production, whereas the benefits for European producers are harder to discern. I therefore abstained from the vote.</p>

It is also very important to note that adequate protection will also be afforded to Georgian GIs regarding wine. I believe that the Georgian wine GIs recognised will undoubtedly have a positive impact on this sector and the agricultural economy, and will also boost progress in the export of agricultural products. I believe that this agreement is a major step towards broader EU-Georgia trade relations. In addition, this is an excellent opportunity for Georgia to negotiate and conclude with the EU a substantial agreement on a key trade-related issue, including technical commitments.</p>

From the EU perspective, the agreement will protect the geographical indications of around 820 foodstuffs, 1 930 wines and 320 spirits; from the Georgian side, it will protect the geographical indicators of around 18 wines. However, it should be noted that the wine market accounts for a significant proportion of Georgia’s economy.

For its part, Europe has an interest, in addition to other agreements which it has ratified, in ratifying Regulation No 29 of the UN Economic Commission for Europe on uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regard to the protection of the occupants of the cab of a commercial vehicle. These regulations will allow the same specifications to be applied in all countries, thereby reducing administrative costs, and will therefore help European industry somewhat in competing more broadly and more effectively at a time which is vital to its economy.

      <p sl="pt">In the context of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations seeks to establish uniform regulations that take account of road safety, environmental protection and trade between various countries.

It is a regulatory framework also applied in European countries that are not part of the EU, in the Commonwealth of Independent States, in Japan and in North America. As such, and in view of Europe’s robust automotive industry, there is justification for the Union’s accession to ‘Regulation No 29 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe’ on uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regard to the protection of the occupants of the cab of a commercial vehicle, whose implementation was already provided for in Regulation (EC) No 661/2009.

I think that the application of the measures set out in the texts will bring further improvements to road safety rules, an area in which much can still be done to reduce the high number of road accident victims. Unfortunately, despite the Member States’ efforts, many people fall victim to these terrible accidents even today. Indeed, in 2009 alone, some 35 000 people were killed and 1.5 million injured, with the latest estimates saying that this includes 16 000 children. For these reasons, the Union – which currently accedes to some 126 UNECE regulations – needs to adapt the provisions currently in force to the more recent measures set out in the UNECE regulations.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a new member of the Committee on International Trade, it is fitting that my first speech in the second half of this legislature should be related to a report by this Committee. The Moreira report deals with pedestrian safety and light emitting diodes (LEDs). The introduction of LEDs for pedestrian safety is definitely a subject everyone is in agreement with. Indeed many third-world countries have introduced LEDs into their traffic control systems. It is strange that most European countries have not done the same. The only argument being put forward is that, during a time of austerity, this is not the right time for capital expenditure. I do not agree for three reasons. In the long term, this is cost effective. Firstly, LEDs are energy savers reducing the cost of energy. Secondly, if they help to reduce pedestrian injuries, they reduce the very high costs of hospitalisation and rehabilitation. Thirdly, if they help to prevent death, then the investment in that particular human (i.e. education) will not be lost. But the most important reason is that all human life is sacred and must be protected at all costs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There are bodies little known by the general public that do work important to our daily lives and should, therefore, be pointed out and exulted. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is one of these. Initially established as a regional organisation of the UN, it is now open to all countries of the world, as well as to professional organisations, NGOs and regional organisations, and today includes more than 70. The UNECE’s World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) debates and approves the global harmonisation of these regulations, particularly for countries that produce motor vehicles. It seems clear to me that there is an economy of scale for our EU in considering these regulations/type-approvals at global level, taking into account not just the interests of producers, but also the safety of users and the general public. This is mainly because, for example, UNECE approvals are considered EU approvals, meaning that it cuts red tape, but it is also because, objectively, it raises the bar in terms of the requirements relating to the quality, safety, environmental protection, reliability, etc. of all products manufactured. As such, I applaud the work of the UNECE in general, particularly the work of the WP.29 and, specifically, this draft regulation relating to light emitting diode light sources.</p>

      <p sl="it">The World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is a global forum on motor vehicle regulations.

Since I agree that this UNECE regulation will enable the same rules to be applied in many countries and that the benefits of such harmonised regulations are tangible in road safety, environmental protection and trade, I am voting in favour of the Council’s draft decision on the UNECE’s position on pedestrian safety and light emitting diode (LED) light sources.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the context of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations seeks to establish uniform regulations that take account of road safety, environmental protection and trade between various countries. To date, the EU has acceded to 106 of the 126 regulations agreed in the UNECE, 62 of which are applied within the Union. It is a regulatory framework also applied in European countries that are not part of the EU, in the Commonwealth of Independent States, in Japan and in North America. As such, and in view of Europe’s robust automotive industry, accession to the two new regulations that have been tabled relating to pedestrian safety and light emitting diode light sources is justified. In light of the Committee on International Trade’s recommendation, I voted in favour.</p>

The European Commission, as the EU’s representative, thinks that both draft regulations relating to pedestrian safety and LED light sources should be included in the European Union vehicle type-approval system. This means that both draft UNECE regulations become part of the European vehicle type-approval system. The aim of the standardised requirements of the draft UNECE regulation on the vehicle approval provisions regarding pedestrian safety and the vehicle approval provisions regarding LED light sources is to remove the current technical barriers in the car trade between the contracting parties to the revised 1958 Agreement (on the technical requirements for wheeled vehicles) and to ensure that these vehicles provide a high level of safety and protection.</p>

Therefore, to avoid any discrimination between European Union carriers, we shall replace the national designation clauses by an EU designation clause. As our rapporteur, Brian Simpson, has pointed out, ‘the objective is to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the EU Member States concerned and Indonesia’. Furthermore, while traditional bilateral agreements tend to exempt international flights from fuel taxation, this type of taxation is authorised for operations within the European Union.

This clause aims to ensure that all EU air carriers have non-discriminatory access to routes between the EU Member States concerned and Indonesia. As for safety assurance, according to the agreement, safety provisions in bilateral agreements are applicable to situations when regulatory control over an air carrier is exercised by a Member State other than the Member State that designated that air carrier.

      <p sl="pt">This recommendation, drafted by Mr Simpson, concerns a draft decision of the Council regarding the conclusion of the agreement between the Union and the government of the Republic of Indonesia on certain aspects of air services. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, substantially changed the powers of several European institutions, particularly Parliament, which, in the new set-up, is called on to rule on matters which were not previously under its jurisdiction, as in this case of an international agreement between the EU and the Republic of Indonesia on air services. It is noteworthy that this agreement, negotiated by the Commission, replaces certain provisions of the 19 existing bilateral air services agreements in force, concluded between EU Member States and the Republic of Indonesia. I welcome the establishment of another agreement whose purpose is to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes with Indonesia as their destination, which represents an important step in strengthening relations between the EU and the Republic of Indonesia in the aviation sector; it also covers safety and taxation of aviation fuel.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This draft agreement follows on from several identical agreements already concluded between the EU and other countries. As we mentioned in relation to these other agreements, in the specific context in which civil aviation currently operates, this draft agreement raises serious concerns about its scope and possible consequences. Moves to ‘avoid discrimination between EU air carriers’ with the supposed creation of a level playing field for the various European companies could contribute to facilitating monopolistic concentration within the sector, which is already under way. The reference to the primacy of free competition in Article 4 comes under this heading, seeking to reduce the Member States’ ability to defend their flag carriers, in a sector that is strategic in terms of safeguarding national interests for a number of reasons. However, it should be stressed that, in this case, the possible implications for Portugal will be comparatively less than those of previous agreements already concluded, such as those with Brazil, the United States and Canada.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There are 19 bilateral agreements on air services in force between Member States and Indonesia. The purpose of concluding this agreement is to bring an end to these bilateral agreements and establish a single one governing relations on certain aspects of air services with Indonesia. The Union has been signing a number of agreements of this type, because the EU Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that the traditional national designation clauses included in bilateral air services agreements infringed EU law. As such, to prevent clauses that discriminate against EU airlines and the violation of Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on freedom of establishment, this agreement establishes the principle of the EU designation for all carriers from the EU.

The agreement signed on 29 June 2011 replaces certain provisions included in the existing 19 bilateral agreements on air services concluded between EU Member States and Indonesia. Certain provisions in the bilateral agreements on air services between EU Member States and Indonesia contained sections which infringe European Union legislation and must be made to comply with it in order to establish a solid legal basis for air services between the European Union and Indonesia, as well as to maintain the continuity of the relevant air services. The purpose of the agreement is to grant all EU carriers the right of non-discriminatory access to the routes between the relevant Member States and Indonesia. The aim through this agreement is not for the EU to increase the total volume of air traffic between the EU and Indonesia, to upset the balance between European Union and Indonesian air carriers, or to negotiate the changes made to the provisions on traffic rights in the existing bilateral agreements on air services. The agreement contains provisions on safety, taxation of aviation fuel and banning anti-competitive practices.</p>

An international agreement enabling the greenhouse gas emissions of air transport to be taken into account is crucial.

      <p sl="it">The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), pursuant to its rules of procedure, only allows states to join it as members. However, some years ago, the Commission sought to launch negotiations for the accession of the EU, hoping for an amendment to the ICAO’s rules. Such an amendment did not take place, and the EU is still excluded from full participation. Through the memorandum now proposed by the Council, the EU is trying to get around the obstacles posed by international law, in order to join the ICAO informally and to exert its own influence within it, although it does not legally have the right to do so. In essence, this agreement seems to be a Trojan horse that will allow the Commission to get around international law, and, what is more, at the expense of the EU Member States which, by contrast, are legal and fully-fledged members of the ICAO. Despite this, they could gradually lose their ability to exercise their rights within the ICAO if this memorandum were to enter into force. There would, of course, be specific advantages that would derive from the EU’s greater involvement in the ICAO, but these advantages would be achieved by bypassing the provisions of international law, and passing over the rights legally guaranteed to the Member States.

The ICAO regulates policies on safety, security, the environment and air traffic management. In addition, ICAO standards and requirements provide the basis for EU legislation. In conclusion, I think that it is of paramount importance for the EU to get involved in this activity and in the process of defining ICAO policies, with the aim of helping devise suitable policies for the civil aviation sector. Furthermore, the Memorandum envisages that the parties will share electronic information, data and official publications, and provide mutual access to databases, which will help strengthen relations between the two organisations.</p>

Disregarding for a moment their actual composition in terms of the representation of members of various political factions, in my opinion, it is necessary, in particular, to take into consideration expertise or previous experience under all circumstances when addressing issues of responsibility.

This directive also seeks to improve the environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of electrical and electronic equipment, such as producers, distributors and consumers, particularly those operators directly involved in the collection and treatment of WEEE. Different national applications of the producer responsibility principle lead to substantial disparities in the financial burden on economic operators, and having different national policies on the management of WEEE hampers the effectiveness of recycling policies.

The issues of the treatment and recycling of waste and of the obsolescence of everyday consumer products are at the heart of the problems we have to manage within our societies. The directive we are adopting today relates to waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Each European citizen is responsible for producing between 17 and 20 kg of electronic waste on average a year. The target is commensurate with the situation: the directive provides for each Member State to increase its collection of WEEE, regardless of whether or not the annual target of 4 kg per person has already been met. This directive is positive for European consumers, who will, from now on, be able to return their small appliances to retailers and businesses with no obligation to purchase a new product. This directive is a further step forward for the recycling and treatment of WEEE in Europe. I very much welcome the stricter checks on the illegal shipping of WEEE to third countries, so as to prevent the treatment of WEEE from endangering workers.</p>

The main benefit of the draft directive is the fact that the obligation to recycle will be extended to the entire spectrum of electrical and electronic equipment, including solar panels. The directive improves the categorisation of individual pieces of equipment for collecting raw materials, in particular, introducing a new category for small IT equipment and telephone apparatus, which will lead to raw materials collected in this way being used in the production of smart mobile devices and similar equipment.

The revision therefore aims to eliminate the excessive and unnecessary bureaucratic burden, entailing technical, legal and administrative problems, which leads to costs for market participants and the Member States, to ongoing environmental harm, to less innovation in waste collection and treatment, to the absence of a level playing field, and even to the distortion of competition. I should like to highlight the most important of the objectives listed in the report: specifically, that of reducing costs by eliminating all unnecessary red tape, without affecting environmental safety; that of additional efforts towards making the WEEE Directive more effective and applicable by increasing the rate of compliance and reducing free-loading; and, finally, that of reducing the impact of the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE products on the environment, in order to maximise their net benefit for society.</p>

      <p sl="it">The exponential growth in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) means that hard-hitting changes to the legislation governing its recycling and production cannot be put off.</p>
      <p sl="it">The growth in the sector is directly proportional to the effect on the Europe 2020 objectives for a resource-efficient economy: to achieve this, national legislation is no longer sufficient; what is needed is systematic European legislation. In line with these objectives, in addition to avoiding further damage to the environment and in order to hold on to precious resources, what we need are high collection rates, appropriate recycling standards, targeted action against illegal exports and a fairer distribution of responsibilities and costs between producers, consumers and public authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament’s amended text seems to be in line with these requirements and, in addition, puts forward two particularly sensitive aspects that deserve attention and support. Firstly, it includes eco-design, not only with regard to energy consumption standards, but also with regard to a simplification of the procedures for dismantling or recovery of raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="it">Equally important is the requirement for the costs incurred in the recovery and treatment of raw materials to become an integral part of the product’s price, so as to form an incentive for the purchase of products with lower impacts. I voted for this recommendation for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has been extensively revised at second reading, following four rounds of trialogues, where Parliament was represented by the rapporteur Mr Florenz, whom I would now like to congratulate on his excellent work. This revision has been carried out for two main reasons, which are well explained in the report. Firstly, it has been revised owing to the experience gained from implementing the directive since it came into force, when some weaknesses were found in its architecture and implementation. Secondly, it has been revised because it faces a number of new challenges, since WEEE is the type of waste that has seen the most growth in the EU. The amendments agreed today will make the directive more effective, enhance its applicability and protect the environment, so I obviously voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Waste electrical and electronic equipment has increased exponentially throughout the EU and its processing and recycling today constitutes a particularly significant problem in Europe. Apart from the environmental and public health issues, which are worrying in themselves, failure to reuse raw materials results in inefficiency and additional cost for the production system, which could be resolved by making better use of the materials employed to make the equipment in question.

      <p sl="pt">The market for electrical and electronic equipment has grown exponentially over recent decades, particularly for mobile phones, computers and televisions, owing to technological innovation and very aggressive advertising campaigns. This has led to an increase in the tonnes of waste from these products, which are left in open-air dumps or illegally exported. Apart from the environmental problems that this causes, putting human health at risk, this situation constitutes an enormous waste of materials, including precious metals such as gold, platinum and silver, which could help global economic recovery and reduce the extraction of natural resources. This recommendation for second reading, drafted by Mr Florenz, concerns the Council position at first reading on the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on this waste. It is imperative to proceed towards the implementation of measures that encourage selective collection, recycling and/or recovery of these materials, so I voted for this report. I hope that the new directive will be applied as swiftly as possible, and that it will thereby contribute to improving public health and preventing the illegal export of waste electrical and electronic equipment to countries that do not have environmental controls.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This is the final stage in the adoption of a directive establishing measures to protect the environment and human health, preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of the production and management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). The reality is that waste flows have been growing within the EU, and that it is therefore necessary to take measures aimed at the collection and treatment of waste, with a view to increasing recycling and reuse, especially in relation to secondary raw materials. The scope of the directive extends to all electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), unless explicitly excluded. New definitions have been added to enhance legal certainty and consistency with other EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In terms of its targets, within four years, the Member States should achieve a collection rate of 45% of WEEE, taking account of the EEE that has been placed on the market in the last three years.

      <p sl="sk">Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was adopted on 27 January 2003 and entered into force on 13 February 2003. Member States were required to transpose the requirements of the directive by 13 August 2004. Neither the drivers nor the rationale for collecting and recycling WEEE have changed since the adoption of the directive. Experience with the first years of implementation of the WEEE Directive has indicated technical, legal and administrative problems that result in unintentionally costly efforts from market actors and administrations, continuing environmental harm, low levels of innovation in waste collection and treatment, a lack of a level playing field or even distortion of competition, as well as unnecessary administrative burdens. The Commission is committed to developing a better regulatory environment, one that is simple, understandable, effective and enforceable. The specific objectives of the review of the WEEE Directive are therefore the following areas: reduced administrative costs without lowering the level of environmental protection; implementation of the directive through increased compliance and reduced free-riding; reduced impacts on the environment from the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE at the levels where the greatest net benefit to society results. If the necessary measures had not been adopted, the problems and disparities in this area would continue. This was one of the reasons that the directive in question was amended accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Each year, 8.7 million tonnes of waste electrical and electronic equipment are thrown away in the European Union, but only 25% of this waste is collected and treated. Yet components are often found in this type of waste which are particularly dangerous to health and the environment. Current practices in our Member States need to change. It is in this context that I voted for the compromise obtained after many years of negotiations, which sets a waste recovery target of 85% in 2019. As a result, despite opposition from some companies, which complain that a heavy burden is being placed on them, it is expected that the major distributors will have to set up collection points for used telephones and small appliances to encourage consumers to recycle. A new obligation will also be established to prevent European companies from sending potentially dangerous goods outside the EU. Finally, the recycling of precious metals, such as gold, silver and rare earth metals contained in these used products, which will reduce our dependence on external sources for these materials, is another advantage.</p>

These efforts will have to rise to 65% within four years of the entry into force of the text. This directive will also have an impact on the daily lives of the citizens, since it provides for the obligatory setting up of waste collection points for small appliances in shops selling electrical and electronic equipment.

The report was one of Parliament’s most important achievements in that electoral term, and it is good that it is now being brought up-to-date.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Thanks to legal reform, more and more electronic equipment is being repaired and recycled, something which, in the past, could not even be realised in practice. As I said during the previous WEEE debate, this is exactly how we can ensure that product design is environmentally friendly, and thus guarantee the feasibility of the whole directive. When producers know that they will eventually have to pay for the final phases of the equipment, costs are minimised beforehand, and they will ensure that as little waste as possible is generated and that this small amount is as recyclable as possible. In this way, the entire chain of producers, importers, traders, consumers, waste management operatives and recycling centres, as well as the authorities, are all accountable, just as they should be.</p>

      <p sl="de">The illegal trade in electrical waste is thriving. Time and time again, waste from Europe ends up in developing countries, where it poisons people and the environment. Around 700 000 tonnes of electrical waste was generated in 2010 in Germany alone; 155 000 tonnes of this is illegally shipped to countries such as Ghana every year. Either disposal companies that have already been paid by the device manufacturers to recycle the waste flog it off to dealers, or citizens are enticed to buy the equipment for a couple of euro from the gates of municipal recycling facilities. The new directive on electrical waste is intended to provide the authorities with a legally binding basis that allows them to define quite clearly what is waste and what is a used product. When fridges or mobile phones are taken out of use, expensive raw materials such as gold, copper or silver should be reused in Europe. Moreover, proper reuse would reduce the amount of electrical waste that poisons people and the environment. The directive has noble aims, but it remains to be seen what impact it has in practice. If dealers are no longer allowed to take back old equipment, then it is to be feared that a lot of electrical waste will be dumped illegally. For this reason, I voted against the report.</p>

I therefore voted in favour, in view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety’s recommendation for second reading.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Belgium is European champion in the collection of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), a title not to be taken lightly with almost 10 kg of domestic appliances collected per inhabitant thanks to the efficiency of the Recupel system, which has existed since 2001. This figure is encouraging for the protection of the environment and much higher than the minimum annual collection target of 4 kg per inhabitant established in 2003 by the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment. Of course, Belgium and Europe can always do better and build on the new and very ambitious collection targets established on the basis of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council, which was finalised this afternoon with the adoption of the report by Karl-Heinz Florenz: a collection target of 65% for 2019 established on the basis of the volume of WEEE placed on the market in the three preceding years, a new scope extended to photovoltaic panels in six years, and the encouragement of Member States to separate waste so that it can be re-used. For the picture to be complete, the European Union must also set an example beyond its borders by combating the illegal export of hazardous electronic waste to third countries, which is a genuine health and environmental scourge, notably on the African continent.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the document in question because the 2003 directive on the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment will thus finally be updated and, from now on, it will be easier to collect and recycle refrigerators, telephones and computer gadgets. I believe it is particularly useful that from today, consumers will be able to return small e-waste items directly to retailers, cutting red tape for businesses and optimising specific collection procedures. Better processing of this waste will also make it possible to recover more efficiently valuable raw materials, such as gold used for electronic circuits, ultimately preventing harmful substances going to landfill.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In Europe, 9.3 million electrical and electronic items are sold every year. These products include refrigerators, ovens, washing machines, irons, televisions, computers, telephones and compact fluorescent lamps, all of which constitute a large amount of waste that will have to be recycled one day. It is estimated that more than eight million tonnes of electronic waste was produced in Europe in 2005, that is, 20 kg per inhabitant. That total is expected to reach 12.3 million tonnes by 2020. The EU had a duty to fill the regulatory gaps that were preventing this waste from being properly managed, as regards collection, recovery, recycling and combating its illegal export. The collection rate for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in EU Member States should reach 45% of volumes placed on the market in the next four years and 65% in the next seven years. In addition, this directive makes provision for strengthening producers’ maximised responsibility, increasing the collection targets of household and professional WEEE, increasing recycling targets and reducing administrative burdens for businesses. I am therefore in favour of this latest step that is being taken towards an environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient economy.</p>

I voted in favour of this report since I believe it is necessary to do everything possible to guarantee the recycling and recovery of raw materials, avoiding, in any case, harm to health. Awareness and information campaigns for the European public are vital to provide impetus to separate collection, with a significant effect also on prices. The next step will be to bring Member States closer together in terms of implementation of the directive, since for now, different percentages are laid down for recycling targets. I believe, however, that this report strikes a fair balance between the European Union’s duties and what falls to the Member States to regulate.</p>

      <p sl="it">The WEEE Directive currently in force already requires the Member States to carry out separated collections of electrical and electronic equipment and sets recovery and recycling targets.

In the case of WEEE from private households, Member States are creating systems allowing this waste to be returned free of charge. Some Member States, including Romania, may, due to the lack of required infrastructure and the low level of EEE consumption, decide to achieve, within four years of the directive’s entry into force, a collection rate of between 40 and 45% of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years, and postpone the achievement of the final collection rate mentioned in Article 7(1) until a future date which must not be later than nine years after the directive’s entry into force.

It is based on three decisions: producing sustainable equipment, fully reusing materials from end-of-life products, and involving local actors in this recycling process. It is also necessary for this directive to be properly implemented on the basis of specific criteria, such as the ‘creation of convenient facilities, including public collection points, where private households should be able to return their waste at least free of charge’; the implementation by Member States of an 85% minimum collection rate for WEEE; the free provision of information by producers about preparation for re-use and treatment of each type of new EEE placed on the market within one year of the equipment being placed on the market.

For many of our enterprises – and this is particularly true in my home region of Saxony, one of Europe’s leading centres of research and high technology – these raw materials are therefore indispensable. The extraction of metals from electrical and electronic waste has therefore become an important topic again. Considerable potential exists in electrical equipment such as computers and mobile phones. In Germany, we are already very good at recycling compared with many other Member States, but even here, many important raw materials are lost in electrical waste – whether legally or illegally. That is not just ecologically and socially questionable; it is also increasingly an economic problem. To me, therefore, extracting and retrieving raw materials as effectively as possible while ensuring an end to the illegal shipping of electrical waste to developing countries, where it poisons people, is one of the most important achievements of this directive. In future, then, it is the contractor and not the customs authorities that must prove in controls that the equipment is serviceable and is not electrical waste, so that we can stem the tide of illegal exports.

      <p sl="sk">I supported the draft of the submitted directive, although sometimes, I feel that we are going about it in the wrong way. We are spending most of our time and energy dealing with the consequences. We see a huge amount of electrical and electronic waste that is, in many cases, highly toxic; we also see that further raw materials are needed for the manufacture of new electronic appliances. We think it fair that the costs of collection and treatment of electrical and electronic waste should be borne by the manufacturer and, ultimately, the purchaser of the product. The submitted draft draws on these considerations. The real problem, however, is the service life of electrical and electronic equipment. Introducing a mandatory minimum warranty period of two years looks like a significant step towards higher quality, until we realise that most manufacturers understand the word ‘minimum’ to mean the threshold beyond which it does not pay to continue because costs would increase. I therefore think that until manufacturers, and consequently consumers, start to see recycling as an item that is comparable in terms of cost with a substantial lengthening of the service life of products, our efforts to bring about the use of electrical and electronic waste will have only limited results.</p>

In accordance with the precautionary principle, authorisation procedures will be simplified, allowing consumers to have safer and more effective plant protection products. This is a significant improvement to current legislation, because it provides the industry with a more effective and reliable authorisation system, both with regard to requirements and procedures, resulting in uniform safety assessments.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document. Biocidal products are necessary for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health and for the control of organisms that cause damage to natural or manufactured products. Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (hereinafter ‘the directive’) establishes a harmonised regulatory framework for the authorisation and the placing on the market of biocidal products and the establishment of a positive list of active substances that may be used in biocidal products. The directive’s provisions require the Commission to draw up a report seven years after its entry into force and to submit the report to the Council. The review of the implementation of the directive has indicated that for the evaluation of active substances, the simplified procedures provided for in the directive, notably for low risk products, have no real effect, and that in addition, the data requirements and data waiving provisions may be unclear or inconsistently applied or lead to a disproportionate burden in some circumstances. The new regulation is seeking to improve the existing regulatory framework, without reducing the high level of protection for the environment and human and animal health, to increase the free movement of biocidal products within the Union, and to reduce the administrative burden for companies and public authorities.</p>

It is unprecedented in its inclusion of specific, comprehensive measures on nanomaterials. There was an urgent need to fill this gap in EU legislation. Those objects sold on the market and treated with biocides will therefore be required to mention on their label all the products used. With regard to substances considered carcinogenic or toxic for genes, reproduction or hormones, these will be strictly prohibited with the aim of protecting citizens and encouraging manufacturers to innovate by developing new, safer products. A word of caution, however. We should remain alert to new authorisations and the granting of renewals for exceptions. Member States will be able to make an exception only when absolutely necessary.

Although I would have preferred the agreement to be implemented more quickly than the three-step approach advocated in the agreement and justified by the need to ensure the optimum operation of the European Chemicals Agency, I still believe that this procedure, along with the simplified procedure for low risk products, will reduce considerably the costs which will be incurred by the industry for authorising new products. This will also promote innovation in this area, as it will encourage new products to be placed on the market which are more effective and less harmful to the environment and users.

They enter the food chain, soil and water. Although the present legislation is the product of a compromise, it has achieved significant progress since it was first adopted in 1998. The following are regulated by law: a drastic reduction in carcinogenic substances and substances classified as toxic for reproduction; the facility for Member States to impose a ban or restriction where specific circumstances so warrant; stricter licensing; improved labelling and a ban on misleading information; a reduction in animal testing; the substitution of safer alternatives for dangerous substances; separate safety tests and labelling of products containing nanomaterials.

This will undoubtedly be the best and most efficient system for improving the availability of these products, providing incentives for innovation and creating added value for human health and protecting nature. However, I believe considerable efforts must still be made to improve it, with the aim of ensuring that the objectives are achieved, such as eliminating the shortcomings of Directive 98/8/EC on authorisation and streamlining decision making, while developing a high level of protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this recommendation for second reading with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products, which will amalgamate into one text EU legislation currently spread over several documents, will eliminate unnecessary red tape, and will extend the scope of EU intervention to products and materials treated with biocides, including supposedly low risk products. This regulation also makes the data requirements for products clearer and more visible, for example, through labelling, while also minimising the possibility of animal testing, increasing the involvement of the European Chemicals Agency and ensuring the uniform application of these rules throughout the EU. I would congratulate my colleague, Ms Klass, on the political compromise which she has managed to achieve with the other parliamentary groups, the Commission and the Council. However, I share her doubts as to the authorisation of active substances/biocidal products, which should move towards greater EU-level centralisation, in order to avoid duplications and increase safety. Like the rapporteur, I also believe training should be promoted for the relevant target groups, particularly professional users.</p>

It also makes provision for a simplified process for authorising the placing on the market and banning of the most harmful substances such as carcinogenic agents. Once this legislation is formally adopted, the updated 1998 legislation (Directive 98/8/EC) will guarantee that treated products, such as furniture treated with fungicides, will be included in the scope of the new regulation. This vote was therefore of the utmost importance for guaranteeing a high level of protection for consumers, which is my main priority. It should be noted that pesticides for agricultural use will continue to come under other EU legislative texts, and this will have to be tackled as well.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Modern life requires increasingly constant and intensive use of biocidal products. At the same time, these products are required to be ever more effective and aggressive, making them also more dangerous to handle. For that very reason, the approach to regulating the marketing and use of biocidal products has to pay particular attention to consumer and user protection.

      <p sl="pt">This recommendation for second reading, drafted by Ms Klass, concerns the Council’s position at first reading on the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the making available on the market of biocidal products, which amounts to 90 000 tonnes in the EU alone. Biocides, which are products used to combat harmful organisms such as bacteria and parasites, can be used to protect both human and animal health, so they need to be clearly regulated with a framework directive requiring them to be used sustainably. Although their use has a markedly positive effect on our lives, we must be vigilant in order to eliminate carcinogens or products that cause infertility, as well as to cancel out potential side effects. The measures just adopted improve the certification process, reduce bureaucracy and consolidate the single market through standardisation; what is allowed in a country like Italy or France will also be allowed in Portugal or Spain. I therefore voted for this recommendation because it will help to protect human and animal health and will contribute to improving the environment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Biocides are used in the prevention of, and protection against, pests and other organisms that may threaten human health. However, their uncontrolled use can also be harmful to health and the environment. This report contains some improvements on the first reading, which are the result of the compromise reached in negotiations between the groups. The most important of the positive aspects includes a more obvious concern with ensuring a high level of protection for human and animal health and the environment, as well as matters relating to labelling containing information for the consumer that is not misleading, as in the possible use of nanomaterials. As the rapporteur says, requirements for information on active substances and biocidal products must take into account the latest methods of avoiding experiments on animals.

      <p sl="sk">Biocidal products are necessary to protect against organisms that are harmful to human or animal health and to protect against organisms that cause damage to natural or manufactured products. The purpose of the regulation in question is to increase the free movement of biocidal products within the European Union. In order to remove, as much as possible, barriers to trade in biocidal products that stem from the different levels of protection in the Member States, harmonised rules should be laid down for the approval of active substances and the placing on the market and use of such products, including rules on the mutual recognition of authorisations and on parallel trade. In order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to compile an EU list of active substances that are authorised for use in biocidal products, and a procedure should also be established for assessing whether an active substance may be included in that list. The proposal also aims to simplify the rules on data protection, to avoid duplicating the preparation of studies, to improve the harmonisation of charging systems in the Member States, to introduce rules for parallel trade in biocidal products, and to include products or materials treated with biocidal products in the scope of the directive.</p>

The new text provides for increased health requirements, not only in the production of biocides, but also in their use. In addition, it establishes the welcome harmonisation of the current rules, which therefore improves consumer safety and environmental protection and eliminates distortions of competition within the internal market.

      <p sl="de">Biocides are active substances and preparations which contain one or more active substances in the form in which they reach the user, with the intention of destroying, deterring, rendering harmless, preventing the action of, or otherwise exerting a controlling effect on harmful organisms by chemical or biological means. This definition is clearly stated in the corresponding European directive. Biocidal products are used in a great variety of areas and applications – for example, as wood preservatives. The European Biocidal Products Directive therefore distinguishes between 23 product types in four main groups (disinfectants and general biocidal products; preservatives; pest control; other biocidal products). Since 2009, biocidal products have been subject to an authorisation and registration procedure which takes place nationally in the individual Member States and which is based on an assessment by the authorities of their efficacy and their risks to humans, animals and the environment. Inadequate efficacy and unacceptable effects should thereby be avoided when the products are used as intended. Authorisation of a biocidal product also includes binding instructions as regards labelling and, where appropriate, directions for use. Where this report is concerned, I spoke in favour of the amendments to the original draft because I consider it important that the active substances that will be subject to a simplified authorisation procedure are now listed in the annex to the regulation.</p>

With this text, protecting the environment and improving our health score points. Let us hope once again that this will not just be rhetoric.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am pleased to support the compromise package for the regulation of biocidal products. My constituency of London is home to a number of companies who use products such as disinfectant and pest control products, which, for human health and environmental reasons, require a certificate of authorisation. To achieve authorisation, a company has to put together a dossier, including proof that there is no viable alternative. The new regulation introduces a mandatory data-sharing mechanism to avoid duplication of studies which will save money and time for companies requiring such authorisation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Biocidal products are intended to destroy, deter and render harmless harmful organisms. Many can be harmful to humans or animals. Therefore, each country monitors their use very closely and takes care that they are used only when necessary and that they do not endanger people. The regulation on biocidal products harmonising the market rules for these products is necessary for two reasons. Above all, it assures EU citizens that each manufacturer must meet the same strict conditions in order for its product to be offered for sale. Producers must therefore maintain the same standards for the protection of human health and the environment. This uniform approach is, however, also beneficial for producers. It reduces the costs of certification of their products and enables them to supply their products to any EU country without having to undergo demanding authorisation procedures many times. This creates room for innovations in biocidal products and improves their availability. Competition is enhanced and this has a positive impact on prices. Moreover, a central authorisation system contributes to better consumer protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting in favour because higher food prices do not automatically translate into higher farm incomes, and this report expresses that concern. The steady and marked increase in production costs has not been fairly passed along the food supply chain, and has been particularly affecting farmers’ incomes, leading to a constant feeling of insecurity in agriculture. The situation is of particular concern for farmers in isolated regions, such as the outermost regions, for which the factors of distance and isolation already entail additional costs. As such, it is vital to promote transparency in order to identify what is leading to this situation, so encouraging resilience in the face of price volatility. That is the only way to provide a supply chain that treats all those involved in the process fairly, both up- and downstream, and farmers and consumers in particular.</p>

      <p sl="el">The report confines itself to describing the problem of falling agricultural incomes because it wants to hide the causes that generate the problem, reduce agricultural incomes and decimate the income of the working and grassroots family with rocketing food prices. Surprisingly, it barely mentions the fact that energy, fertilisers, plant health products, water, seeds, fodder and so on belong to and are controlled by international monopolies, which set the prices and negate the effort made by farmers and working consumers, in order to increase their profits. Subsidised EU programmes promote the concentration of land in large farm holdings within the framework of the CAP and its reform post-2013. The privatisation of water is making it more expensive to use; the same applies to increased charges and prices for energy. The report supports the EU CAP, which is a disaster for farmers of poor and medium-sized holdings, and promotes the ‘competitiveness’ of farming in the EU, which means the concentration of land in large capitalist undertakings and the mass expulsion of poor farmers from their fields. The only way forward for farmers of poor and medium-sized holdings is to fight the CAP and all the EU’s anti-grassroots policies, to join forces with the working class and urban freelancers, and to bring about a radical change in power and the economy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have voted in favour of the resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, which was given overwhelming support. With this ambitious text, the European Parliament calls on national and European competition authorities involved in production and commerce to take action against abusive buyer practices on the part of dominant wholesalers and retailers. More specifically, for the competitiveness of European agriculture, it was vital to bring up the issue of rising costs of purchased farm inputs over the past decade in the fields of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds and water. It is therefore important to avoid distortions of competition and, by solving problems upstream of agricultural production, to improve farmers’ incomes. The overall aim is to have a better distribution policy, to guarantee that all products have the same quality standards within the EU, and to allow producers to have more influence in the food chain. Finally, through this text, I support the EU’s considerable investment in projects that promote sustainable agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report contains interesting points and considerations, with which I agree, on problems that really exist in the European agriculture sector. The vulnerability of the agri-food sector and the volatility of prices, especially of inputs, today make the sector highly unfair and do not help the efficiency and sustainability of the agricultural chain. However, I have to say that references to the issue of climate change, which have nothing to do with the question of farm inputs, are too numerous and insistent. Furthermore, the rapporteur proposes setting up a new European price monitoring agency to prevent and rectify distortions in input prices. One more agency involves increasing EU spending without it being possible to reasonably foresee, in this case as in many others unfortunately, a benefit from its establishment. I therefore chose to abstain.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because I agree that with the growing cost of resources used in agriculture, we need to optimise agricultural production processes and improve resource management as much as possible. In my opinion, this would not only enable farmers to reduce input costs and increase their autonomy and income, but would also be a move to a more sustainable and user-friendly method of farming. For example, energy costs over the last decade have risen by approximately 60%, while farm gate prices have only increased by 25%. This report therefore proposes taking measures to increase the ability of farms to save energy in buildings, farming practices and transport use, and to invest in the production of renewable energy on farms or locally. Another area where management could be improved and savings could thus be made is the use of fertilisers and soil improvers. Solutions include improving farm nutrient analysis and management and better soil fertility analysis and management. Opting to use farm-saved seeds instead of certified seeds is another means of increasing the efficiency of agricultural production proposed by the report. Farm-saved seeds carry not only economic but environmental advantages – on average, they cost 40% less than certified seeds, they allow farmers to grow plants which are adapted to the specific agronomic conditions in their regions, and they often require less fertilisers, while at the same time maintaining crop biodiversity.</p>

I applaud the call to Member States and the Commission to deliver more data on input and production costs, which should then be analysed and regularly provided to farmers by a European price monitoring agency. Price indices might also improve competition in the input sector, and perhaps help farmers to move out of a ‘squeeze position’ between the increasingly concentrated and powerful agro-industry upstream and downstream of primary production.</p>

In relation to the production sector, this report also notes the impact on farmers, who are becoming ever more dependent on an increasingly concentrated input industry.

      <p sl="pt">In view of the imbalances in the farm input supply chain in the Union, which is threatening the viability of many farms, the EU needs to monitor market developments closely, particularly in terms of input costs, and properly monitor variations in costs and identify the reasons behind them. I believe that this analysis and regulation of markets should be done in a prudent way and should seek not to introduce additional distortions into a supply chain in which marked asymmetries have already been identified. Having said that, I believe that this evaluation by the EU and the defence of competitiveness should not cease, as a lack of action in this area could jeopardise agriculture production in the EU and reduce the supply of European agricultural produce to consumers as a result.

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Mr Bové, concerns the farm input supply chain, particularly in terms of its structure and its implications. At a time when the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013 is being discussed, it is pertinent to discuss the problems affecting this strategic sector of the EU in order to halt the flow of people abandoning farming, which jeopardises not only the lack of certain agricultural products, but, above all, the ecosystems associated with this activity in rural and mountainous areas. This is an extremely important and topical report and I voted for it, since it draws attention to the real problems existing in the farm input supply chain and identifies the measures to be taken. An economic activity in which input costs have increased by 60% over a decade, while product costs have risen by only 25%, as has happened in the case of energy costs, is not sustainable. Energy efficiency should be a priority in the new CAP.

      <p sl="sk">In its resolution of 7 September 2010 on ‘Fair revenues for farmers: towards a better functioning food supply chain in Europe’, Parliament adopted a number of recommendations to solve problems downstream of farm production in order to improve farmers’ incomes. Substantial policy changes were proposed in EU competition law and recommendations were made for measures to be included in legislative proposals. The Commission adopted a follow-up note on this resolution in November 2010, in which it announced action in this matter. I believe that it is necessary to provide support for farmers in improving their agronomic and environmental performance, so that they can cope with the new climatic, environmental and economic challenges that they will have to face. Regarding ecological measures, farmers will probably have to reintegrate outsourced production costs associated with better management of biodiversity, water and soil nutrients, and it is for this reason that they will have to be given support. There is, however, an assumption that this initial expenditure will bring benefits to farmers from the long-term perspective, such as resistance to climatic instability, healthier and more productive land, and less vulnerability to disease. If they better learn to exploit the opportunities stemming from these inputs, they will also become more resistant to price fluctuations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report on the farm input supply chain provides an often pertinent analysis of Europe’s agricultural shortcomings. Not only is Europe highly dependent on imports of fossil fuels, but also of animal feed, phosphates and other inputs. The report does not provide any solutions, however, apart from asking the Commission for many new reports and more in-depth studies. It calls on the Commission to address the fact that the majority of phosphate rock comes from five countries. Even if the Commission lies down on a map of the world, it is not going to be able to change that situation. The report states that ‘cheaper feed (is) available on the global market’. This is particularly true of genetically modified (GM) soya, which makes up 80% of world production. However, the rapporteur is a figurehead of the anti-GM food movement, and he is fighting against shale gas, which is plentiful in Europe and could help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels if exploited.

This means that decreasing numbers of farmers will have to double food production, while also battling climate change and maintaining food standards. The total input costs for EU farmers climbed, on average, by almost 40% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices have increased by only 25%.

It recommends the monitoring of access to land, especially for young farmers, which is compromised by the excessive cost of leases.

      <p sl="sk">The strategic importance of agriculture in ensuring food security in the European Union requires that Member States and the Commission adopt measures and stimuli, effectively and swiftly, for its sustainable development and competitiveness. Although agriculture is subject to the rules of competition, the reality of the market in many Member States shows that abuse of market dominance by suppliers of inputs is widespread. The high concentration in the agricultural inputs sector should therefore be a signal for the national anti-monopoly bodies that anti-competitive activities, such as abuse of market dominance, can be taking place to the detriment of producers and of end consumers. The competent authorities of the Member States should ensure improved competition in agriculture by monitoring the situation in the relevant markets more closely and, where violations are found, by imposing deterrent fines.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today, we are discussing issues that cannot be examined individually. The increase in food prices linked to the increase in their production costs is just the tip of the iceberg. Meanwhile, if we take an integrated approach to this issue and take integrated action, we could reduce these costs while also achieving other positive results. Above all, I am talking about the prudent and efficient use of resources associated with production – energy and fertilisers. A change in the attitude and habits of the producers themselves would not only save resources and reduce costs but would also contribute to environmental conservation – greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced and fewer chemical substances would be released into the soil and water bodies.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I voted in favour of the ‘Report on the farm input supply chain: structure and implications’, drafted by José Bové, because I think that it marks a step forward towards reducing the dependence of farmers on the farm input industry and towards ensuring that their position in the food supply chain is fairer. Farmers are faced with a dire situation, starting with the leasing of land, especially in my country, Bulgaria, where 90% of livestock farmers do not own the land they use, then proceeding to the high prices for resources and materials, and ending with low farm gate prices. We need to adopt a two-pronged approach in order to tackle this situation. One aspect is linked to the work done by the institutions and competition authorities. We need to examine the reasons for the high prices for materials and avoid the situation where agribusiness traders are in a dominant position and engaging in unfair competition. Secondly, we must help farmers themselves to discover alternative ways of offsetting high prices, managing their resources effectively and adopting efficient, energy-saving measures, as well as of encouraging processing. Furthermore, we must not burden producers with other requirements and administrative procedures where fulfilling them will push their costs up even more.</p>

      <p sl="et">I voted in favour of Mr Bové’s report on the supply chain of agricultural inputs, its structure and influences, because on the eve of the reform of the common agricultural policy, we should seriously reflect on how it may be possible to raise farmers’ competitiveness and income. I consider it important to emphasise the need for greater cooperation and organisation among farmers – for instance, by collectively purchasing and storing inputs, cooperating in order to improve the use of resources, etc. Another means of increasing farmers’ income is to concentrate on the reduction of production costs – over the past ten years, production has become significantly more costly to farmers due to the overall rise in energy prices. In order to achieve some manner of harmonisation between expenses and income, agricultural producers must implement more and more energy and resource sustainable methods in production processes. As a result, in addition to the gathering of data concerning input and production costs, it would also be necessary to provide European farmers with guidelines regarding the best production solutions and practices, as stated in this report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution because only through joint efforts can we help farmers reduce costs in order to increase their autonomy and income. Furthermore, an effectively functioning farm input supply chain will contribute to a more efficient and sustainable use of production resources. Attention is drawn to the fact that due to resource scarcity, growing demand for food and EU farmers’ limited opportunities to obtain cheaper feed on the world market, upward pressure on input prices is constantly rising. It is therefore very important to ensure that farmers are given proper support so that agricultural and environmental performance improves and new climatic, environmental and economic challenges are addressed. I believe that in the next research framework programme, more funds need to be allocated for research and development in the efficient use and management of farm inputs and improving agronomic efficiency. Enhanced cooperation between the public and private sectors, as well as farmers’ organisations, should also be encouraged at EU level. In order to increase their purchasing power, farmers must be encouraged to collectively organise the storage and purchase of inputs and to form groups for better resource management and sustainable practices.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In addition to the difficulties that farmers experience in bringing products onto the market, exacerbated by their weak bargaining position with distributors, they have seen a gradual rise in input prices. While farm gate prices have increased by around 25% over the last decade, energy costs have increased by about 60%, fertilisers and soil improvers by around 100%, seeds and animal feed by about 30%, costs for non-residential farm buildings by around 20%, and plant protection products and other pesticides by 13%. The increased cost of industrial machinery is also noteworthy. In overall terms, costs for European farmers increased by 40% over the same period. It will come as no surprise, then, that EU farm incomes have fallen by 11.6% since 2009, according to Eurostat data. The difficult obstacles that farmers face can only be overcome with a comprehensive response that helps to restructure agricultural production, reducing its dependence on the volatility of demand and the inputs market. I voted for this report and I agree with this approach, and I hope that the next common agricultural policy will provide a response to these problems.</p>

In its resolution of 7 September 2010 on ‘Fair revenues for farmers: towards a better functioning food supply chain in Europe’, Parliament adopted a number of recommendations to solve problems downstream of farm production in order to improve farmers’ incomes. Parliament suggested substantial policy change in EU competition law and made recommendations for measures to be included in the legislative proposals on CAP 2020 reform. The Commission adopted, on 23 November 2010, a follow-up note on this resolution, which announces action in this matter. This new initiative report identifies problems upstream of farm production, focusing on rising costs of purchased farm inputs over the past decade in the fields of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds and water.

      <p sl="fr">This report is the result of a European Parliament initiative to try to redirect certain policies given the imbalances in the distribution chain for agricultural products, particularly commodities such as cereals and fossil fuels (known as inputs).

It condemns many of the latter to misery by no longer allowing them to make a living from their work with dignity. This paper asks, therefore, that we redress the balance and that we promote sustainable agriculture that respects the environment through limited importation and limited use of these input products. Emphasis is also placed on training farmers and agronomists and on technical developments with a view to promoting the European Union’s food sovereignty and protecting Europeans better against food shortages.

Employment in the food supply chain, agriculture, the agri-food industry and distribution represents 7% of total employment in the EU and is worth EUR 1 400 billion per year – a figure greater than for any other manufacturing sector in the EU. Recent food and commodity price volatility has raised serious concerns about the functioning of European and global food supply chains and has increased insecurity as regards farm incomes and long-term investments by farmers. Farmers’ income problems are continuing to worsen and the prices paid by consumers for products are not reflected in the prices paid to farmers for their production, which is undermining farmers’ capacity to invest and innovate. This might make many farmers decide to leave farming, slowing down the economic recovery of the whole of Europe even more. I welcome the resolution’s provisions that agricultural policy must enable small and medium-sized farms, including family farms, to earn a reasonable income, to produce sufficient food of appropriate quality at affordable prices, to create jobs, to promote rural development and to ensure environmental protection and sustainability.

The Commission must also do everything possible to find a solution as soon as possible to the unfair distribution of profits throughout the agri-food chain, with a particular focus on the profits of agricultural producers. For the good of consumers and the proper functioning of the whole sector, agricultural producers should be put in a position where they can obtain substantial compensation for the major investments they make, and they must be able to produce suitable quantities and quality.

At the same time, the Commission is working on a retail action plan and on a communication mapping and assessing existing rules on unfair practices, and has clearly indicated that it will continue to pursue the strategy of consensus. More needs to be done, but it is important to give the ongoing process a chance. Asking for robust legislation at this stage would risk derailing this and undermining the climate of trust.

      <p sl="pt">Secondly, there are problems with the food supply chain, from producer to consumer, which need to be resolved, particularly improper trading practices intended only to take money from the producers. I therefore welcome the information from the Commission, under the Single Market Act, on the adoption of a communication on these trading practices and misleading advertising.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, as agriculture is the subject of the first integrated European policy, it is essential that it be the focus for resolving the crisis, as the food supply of 500 million Europeans is at stake. There is an urgent need to acknowledge the role of farmers and free them from the stranglehold in which they find themselves, caught between input costs and exploitation by the chains bringing their products to market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is a pity that the majority in this House has missed another opportunity to seriously address the problem of farmers’ incomes and the growing imbalances in the distribution of income in the food supply chain. It has done so with impassioned speeches that acknowledge the problem but do nothing to tackle it, whilst rejecting the proposals of our group, which could truly have added real opportunities for solving the problem. More than forums and high-level groups stating what we have long known, more than the cynical insistence on this fanciful idea of ‘self-regulation’, what was needed were solutions enabling a break with current agricultural and trade policies, which have created the imbalances and injustices that we are once again seeing here. We regret the fact that the majority in this House, including the Portuguese Members from the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the Democratic and Social Centre – People’s Party (CDS-PP) and the Socialist Party (PS), continue to reject measures such as retaining the system of production quotas; establishing mechanisms to regulate the food supply chain effectively; establishing ceilings for trading profit margins, particularly for large supermarkets and retail businesses, using the price paid to producers as a benchmark; and measures aimed at ending dumping between Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Most farmers and agricultural enterprises currently face too great an increase in production costs, while the prices paid by buyers – especially the large distribution companies – are inadequate to cover these additional farmers’ costs. This threatens the survival of many agricultural enterprises, has serious consequences for the food supply chain in the European Union, and exacerbates the trade balance problem. This results in a growing need for imports and also leads to dependence on unstable foreign markets. It is important to ensure that the relationships between distributors and suppliers are fair, and efforts should be made to eliminate unfair practices in the food supply chain; in particular, it would appear to be appropriate and necessary to make reliable information on food prices available across the EU in order to ensure transparency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Many farmers have seen excessive increases in their production costs, without any possibility of recouping those additional costs through the price paid by buyers, especially big retailers, putting many agricultural holdings at risk and, in the longer term, putting agricultural production as a whole at risk. This is why I supported the joint resolution on imbalances in the food supply chain because I thought that it was crucial to ensure loyal and transparent relationships between food producers, suppliers and distributors. The abusive practices of distributors, who put our farmers at an extreme disadvantage, must be denounced. Moreover, we must improve compliance with producers’ payment deadlines, carry out better and more transparent monitoring of price development and lastly, put in place a food trade mediator in order to share information better between competent authorities in this area.</p>

      <p sl="it">I supported the resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain because I believe it is now necessary to start the process to create European legislation that can regulate relationships within the distribution chain, avoiding weaker bargaining conditions for the agricultural sector. Today, there are many farmers and agricultural holdings facing unbearable increases in production costs. These additional costs are not, however, compensated by the prices paid to farmers by those who buy agricultural products, in particular, by large retailers. Our commitment here in Parliament is aimed at making our European agriculture competitive and, at the same time, at protecting farmers who risk not only losing bargaining power in the distribution chain but also seeing their own profit margins wiped out. We need to tackle these risks and insist on a clear definition of abusive and unfair practices often perpetrated to the detriment of farmers, and conduct an information campaign for farmers on the most common illegal contractual and commercial practices together with the instruments at their disposal to report abuses.</p>

The current situation is unacceptable, especially given that up to 50% of healthy, consumable food is wasted in supermarkets, restaurants and households in the EU every year, while 79 million European citizens are living below the poverty line and 16 million are receiving food from charitable organisations. We are expecting, in the future, a persuasive strategy from the European Commission, which will make EU Member States tackle this problem in a systematic way.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this resolution because it is clear how there are enormous imbalances to be rectified in the food supply chain. Profits remain in the hands of the few, especially large retailers, while farmers often do not receive fair compensation for their work and their product. Consumers are the ultimate victims, since they have to pay a higher price due to the inefficiency of the system. I therefore welcome the efforts made towards developing a short supply chain, which can produce immediate benefits for both farmers and consumers. Those who abuse dominant positions, applying prices likely to destroy competition in the market, will be rightly punished. Farms, particularly the smallest, are part of our heritage to be defended and protected, above all, against the power that today lies in the hands of large retailers. Lastly, I would like to add that I am pleased that the House, by a very large majority, rejected an amendment aimed at reintroducing milk and sugar quotas: that system has shown itself to be disastrous, and even Europe has realised it, although shamefully late.</p>

      <p sl="lt">There are several weak links in the food supply chain that require more serious protection. While it can be argued that the consumer interest of obtaining safe products is protected following the adoption of various legal acts on product labelling, aspects of pricing are not yet favourable to either consumer or producer. One of the elements of EU competition policy is the regulation of operators in a monopolistic or dominant position, ensuring the functioning of the free market. On the other hand, such regulation should not mean a return to the times of price regulation. While welcoming this resolution in principle, I therefore believe that legislation in this area is still a long way off.</p>

      <p sl="de">Regrettably, considerable imbalances still exist in the food chain with regard to the disproportionate concentration of power in the hands of certain large companies. This, in turn, results in unfair commercial practices such as late payment, unilateral changes to contracts, unfair contract terms, restrictions on market access, lack of transparent pricing, retail price fixing, purchasing cartels and, not least, the unequal division of profit margins across the food chain. Rules on competition urgently need to be implemented more effectively in this sector, in order to uncover and prevent abuses of market power and cartel activity. Moreover, agricultural producers and processors – particularly small farmers and SMEs in the food chain – need to be placed in a better negotiating position as regards price levels within the value chain. Such a disproportionate concentration has a negative effect on product diversity in the medium and long term, on cultural heritage, on small retailers, on jobs and thus, on the livelihoods of many people. For these reasons, I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The food supply chain is increasingly marked by deep imbalances between producers and distributors. Their economic ascendancy has enabled distributors to impose abusive trading conditions on the contracts that they sign with farmers, for their own benefit, as can be seen in paragraph 10 of the adopted resolution. These practices undermine the normal functioning of the competition market, as trade starts to play a role in which it merely reinforces the stronger position of one party, rather than being founded on negotiation that benefits both; in other words, a positive-sum game. Measures therefore need to be adopted to correct these disparities, such as creating price monitoring mechanisms at the various stages of the supply chain, from producer to consumer, investing in legal information services for producers, and promoting official forums responsible for identifying problems and finding solutions to the imbalances in these trade relations.

      <p sl="it">The food supply chain, agriculture, the agri-food industry and the distribution sector represent over 5% of European added value and 7% of jobs. Moreover, the agri-food industry generates EUR 1 400 billion per year, a figure greater than that generated by any other sector.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Union is a world leader in high-tech products, research and aeronautics and it is, therefore, essential that the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, a tool for monitoring the Earth with a view to combating climate change and environmental degradation, be included in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, and that Galileo should be able to benefit from long-term funding. Parliament does not intend to allow the European Commission to cause the European Union to withdraw financially. The GMES programme is essential for European citizens because it will make it possible to anticipate storms, flooding and land pollution more effectively and to bring swift relief to people affected by a natural disaster. The European Commission must stand by the commitments it made to promoting research and innovation under the EU 2020 strategy so that the EU can remain competitive.</p>

However, at the same time, I regret the exclusion of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) from the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020, an oversight that risks thwarting the efforts made hitherto, leaving solely in the hands of the Member States an initiative that, in this time of economic crisis, might not be accorded the importance it deserves. I believe the EU’s role is vital in consolidating a space programme to allow Europe to remain the world leader in the sector and to provide a boost to industry, employment and scientific research in space technology and in its direct applications. To that end, I agree with and advocate the idea of project bonds, jointly funded financial instruments, whereby the public and private sectors invest in the future by means of structured and agreed planning.</p>

It also improves public well-being and security by enhancing, inter alia , transport, civil protection, and the development of social services for the elderly and disabled. Space is strategically important for Europe, and it is important to ensure a coherent European approach in this area, which will contribute to a robust, competitive and independent European space industry. These proposals are a step in that direction. It is important to ensure that there is appropriate and clear governance in relation to space policy and related programmes, with effective supervisory and coordination mechanisms, in order to harmonise priorities and ensure the optimal management of resources derived from the EU and its Member States. I support the development of an effective space policy able to respond to major global challenges and which must come about through the consolidation of the Galileo, EGNOS and GMES programmes, which promise enormous social, environmental, economic and strategic benefits.

Such research should be aimed at exploiting the potential of space for purely peaceful ends, deepening knowledge and thus seeking new possibilities for solving problems and the current needs of human societies. The report advocates a European space strategy based on a set of programmes that either currently exist or are in development, such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, Single European Sky ATM Research and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). We have funding set aside for these programmes, which relates to their possible use for military purposes. That is the case with the GMES programme, which is aimed at global monitoring for the environment and security, and which includes earth observation and the ‘extraction of precise and useful data’ for preparing military operations and for covert ‘border surveillance’, as well as to ‘support EU External Action’, in addition to risk prevention, emergency management and coastal surveillance. This type of use – for military ends – is of serious concern to us. The Commission, like this report, not only fails to rule this out, but actually opens the door to it.</p>

The Galileo programme provides a satellite navigation system designed for civilian use, for logistics and road safety for transport: essential actions to guarantee the EU’s independence in a strategically important sector. The GMES programme plays a vital role in observation of the Earth, supporting the green economy and long-term investments in technology and infrastructure. It also represents a basis for environmental safety, climate monitoring, emergency management, disaster prevention and many other aspects. It is important to guarantee continuous, long-term funding for these projects. Investments and projects in the space sector have a great impact on many areas such as defence and security, international cooperation, research and development, and the economy.

A common space policy may contribute significantly to reviving the competitiveness of the European economy, fostering scientific and technological progress and stimulating innovation, as envisaged by the Europe 2020 strategy. The economic importance of the European space industry is evident from a few figures: 31 000 highly skilled employees, EUR 5.4 billion in annual turnover, EUR 800 billion of European GDP from satellite radio navigation. In addition to being an engine of industrial development, space policy plays a critical role in protecting the environment, in combating climate change, and in ensuring security for European citizens. That is why the main programmes it uses, Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and Galileo, should receive adequate financial support from the EU. It has repeatedly been stressed that GMES is a key programme for crisis management, civil protection and humanitarian assistance operations.

It is also about improving the security of our territories by reinforcing the monitoring of borders through the satellite monitoring programme (GMES).

      <p sl="it">I voted for the Patriciello report on the space strategy for the European Union because it sets out noble goals that will truly act in the interests of citizens. As well as enabling more appropriate responses in security and defence policy, the European space policy will promote scientific and technological progress, foster innovation and make the industrial system more competitive, not to mention the Galileo satellite radio navigation programme. In the future, we hope to give Europe an important role on the international space scene, guaranteeing citizens the maximum benefits from the projects and investments in the field of space research.</p>

Article 189 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union an explicit mandate for drafting a policy on the exploration and exploitation of space, in order to promote scientific and technical progress, industrial competitiveness and the implementation of its policies. Parliament is making its contribution with this own-initiative report, and one of its reasons for doing so is the fact that the European space industry has a consolidated turnover of EUR 5.4 billion and employs over 31 000 highly skilled people.</p>

      <p sl="it">There is no doubt that space policy is a great opportunity for Europe because it stimulates technological innovation, because it helps to make European citizens more secure, because it creates synergies in a strategic civil and military sector, and, finally, because it creates jobs for highly qualified workers.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore right that the project should play a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. That said, it is all too plain that in terms of governance, the Commission could and should have drawn up a more ambitious plan. The failure to include it in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 risks undermining the investments made so far. The references to cooperation with the United States, Russia and emerging powers are too weak to frame the space policy in an international context.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU has two flagship projects as part of its policy on the exploration and exploitation of space, pursuant to Article 189 of the Treaty of Lisbon: Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security. Under the first project, satellite navigation, an initial open service, an initial regulated public service and an initial search and rescue service will be provided from 2014 onwards. The GMES programme is aimed at collating earth observation data in order to monitor climate change and global security. Today, this market is highly dynamic: the existing global navigation systems – GPS and Glonass, in addition to Galileo – will shortly be joined by a Chinese system; India and Japan are also developing regional systems. Moreover, the economy is becoming increasingly dependent on these services. A comprehensive strategy therefore needs to be adopted to ensure that the European navigation system will be competitive at global level, as well as being a strategy that, above all, serves citizens.</p>

As regards the use of space technologies for security (monitoring of borders, maritime surveillance, emergency management, humanitarian aid, support for the EU’s external action), the Union will have to coordinate properly the existing capacities of Member States, under conditions to be agreed with Member States owning infrastructure, in order to satisfy operational requirements, which may also include developing new infrastructure.</p>

Many areas will benefit from the technological development of the global satellite navigation system. The services and applications developed by the Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programmes will be of enormous benefit to the European economy and to the everyday lives of citizens. It is now necessary to maintain the lead in this area and enable technological development to create business opportunities for European industry. There is also a need to ensure compatibility and interoperability between Galileo and other orbital navigation systems. The potential that this investment will bring requires that the Commission take on some responsibilities, in particular, in terms of financing this strategy and coordinating it with the research programmes being carried out by the Member States.

The aim of EU space policy is to improve the everyday lives of European citizens, enabling economic growth, fostering innovation potential and supporting scientific progress. Space solutions relying on state-of-the-art technologies and a competitive European industrial base are vital for addressing today’s important challenges in society, such as natural disasters, resources and climate monitoring, for developing the telecommunications sector and encouraging relevant applications in the fields of climate change policies, urban planning, environment management, agriculture, maritime safety, fisheries and transport. We call on the Commission to put forward specific proposals in the strategic area of launch vehicles, given the critical financial situation currently facing the launch sector across the globe. The Galileo and EGNOS programmes are vital for creating the Single European Sky and for the safe, reliable management of air traffic in Europe. We call for a firm, ambitious timetable and stable funding for research and innovation, which will ensure technological progress and the growth of industrial capacity. As GMES is an essential tool in combating climate change and environmental degradation, we recommend funding for GMES in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.</p>

The Galileo and GMES initiatives are a good start in that direction but, bearing in mind the progress being made in this sector by competing countries, such as China and Japan, these initiatives urgently need to be supported. The economic crisis overshadowing the EU should not act as a brake on financing for the relevant research programmes at a time when, as pointed out in the report, markets of space services are seeing rapid growth and may prove to be profitable.

      <p sl="en">With over 65 million passengers per year passing through the terminals of Heathrow, my constituency of London is home to the world’s busiest international airport – a great responsibility. The EGNOS and Galileo programmes are both key elements of EU space strategy which makes air travel safer by improving the accuracy of position – the new technology gives pilots their position to within a couple of metres. While I appreciate that new satellite technology can help improve passenger safety, we must be mindful of costs at a time of economic austerity. Last year, the Commission revealed that it would need a further EUR 2 billion to complete the Galileo project. The entire project will cost EUR 22 billion, almost entirely funded by the EU taxpayer. When this system was first proposed, we were told that costs would be considerably lower and that private investment would mean that taxpayers would only have to foot a bill of around EUR 2.5 billion. Space may be the final frontier, but we need to prevent the cost of this project going to infinity and beyond.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In terms of space-related development, we have no doubts as to the importance of enhanced cooperation between Member States and other European countries – most importantly Russia, which has an invaluable wealth of research – and the whole world. Such cooperation should be aimed at exploiting this knowledge in order to solve problems and address current needs, with a view to development, social progress and human well-being, as well as peaceful ends. The report advocates a European space strategy based on a set of programmes such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, Single European Sky ATM Research and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). One of the objectives of the latter is ‘global monitoring for the environment and security’, which will be achieved through Earth observation and the ‘extraction of precise and useful data’, as well as operations involving ‘border surveillance’, as well as to ‘support EU External Action, maritime surveillance, complex emergencies, humanitarian aid and civil protection’. The resolution also calls for ‘strengthening the ‘security’ component of the GMES programme’. Behind these words lies the real danger that the monitoring-related information obtained from space will be used to carry out military operations, in addition to the clear aim of going further down the path of the obsession with security, violating the fundamental freedoms of citizens.

Exchanging best practices at European and national level, as suggested by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the proposed awareness-raising campaigns in schools, and the possible choice of 2013 as the European Year against Food Waste, may well also contribute to hitting the targets that we have set ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="el">The lack of food to meet the food requirements of the population is a serious global problem which also concerns the EU, where 110 million people are living below the poverty line and over 15% of its workers have an income of less than 60% of the average income in the country in which they live. At global level, based on FAO 925 data, millions of people are at risk of malnutrition. In our opinion, food wastage is not the main cause of the global food problem; not that this means that it does not exist. The report conceals the cause of the problem, which is the capitalist method of production, which is not interested in meeting food needs; it is only interested in the profitability of the monopolies and in strengthening large producers at the expense of poor farmers. What food is produced and in what quantities depends on whether the multinationals will make a profit and is not designed to address global hunger. That is why the wish-list in the report cannot address the problem. The only definitive solution to the global food problem is to overturn the capitalist method of production and to replace it with the socialist system, in which food is produced on the basis of grassroots needs, not for the purpose of profit.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that food waste must be reduced along the entire food chain by adopting a coordinated strategy followed up by practical action. An exchange of best practice is also required, at both European and national level, in order to improve coordination between Member States to avoid food waste and make the food supply chain more efficient.

A study published by the Commission estimates annual food waste generation in the 27 Member States at approximately 89 million tonnes. This evidence is unacceptable if we think that in Europe, 79 million people are still living below the poverty line. Food security is a basic human right and for this reason, the European institutions and the Member States must address, as a matter of urgency, the problem of food waste along the entire supply and consumption chain. Reducing food waste is a vital preliminary step in combating hunger in the world, responding to the increased demand predicted by the FAO and improving people’s nutritional levels. I believe that a good way to start to reduce this enormous problem is to inform people not only about the causes and effects of waste, but also about ways of reducing it. A civic culture guided by the principles of sustainability and solidarity could be the first step in the right direction.</p>

By way of example, Parliament has invited the European Commission to promote measures aimed at halving food waste upstream, such as the discounted sale of goods close to their expiry date and of damaged goods, etc. Parliament also calls for new awareness-raising campaigns along with food education courses in schools. Lastly, the resolution calls for the Commission to amend the public procurement rules on catering and hospitality services, so that when contracts are awarded, priority is given to ‘undertakings that guarantee that they will redistribute free of charge any unallocated (unsold) items to groups of citizens who lack purchasing power (…)’. The European Food Aid Programme for the Most Deprived comes to the aid of 13 million deprived people and food waste must therefore not only be reduced but must also be used to benefit those 13 million Europeans who are cruelly in need of it.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Irish consumers throw out 30% of the food bought in supermarkets, at a cost of EUR 1 000 each year for every household. This is the same across the EU and unless something is done, food waste in the EU will grow from 90 million tonnes now to 126 million tonnes by the year 2020.</p>

In the European Union, 79 million people are still living below the poverty line. I agree that we need to invest more heavily in means of reducing food waste which would lead to a reduction in the losses incurred by agri-food businesses and a lowering of food prices, thus potentially also improving access to food for poorer sections of the population. Initiatives have already been launched in various Member States aimed at collecting unsold and discarded products locally throughout the food supply chain in order to redistribute them to citizens below the minimum income threshold, and Member States should exchange best practices in this area. The Commission should also determine ways and means to improve the involvement of agri-food businesses, wholesale markets, shops, distribution chains, public and private caterers, restaurants, public administrations and NGOs in anti-waste practices.</p>

If nothing is done, food wastage will increase by almost 40% by 2020. This own-initiative report, to which I gave my support, puts forward good ideas for changing the situation. The objective that we need to achieve is a halving of food wastage by 2025 and thus improve access to food for deprived people. To achieve this massive reduction, new awareness-raising campaigns will have to be introduced, supported by food education classes in schools, and dual-date labelling could be introduced to show the ‘sell by’ date and the actual ‘use by’ date.

Food wastage statistics show that, in some cases, almost 50% of healthy edible food is lost along the food supply chain. This has repercussions not only for the sustainability of the food chain and for food production itself, but also for product prices and the eco-sustainability of food waste. The report therefore calls on the Commission, the Council and the governments of Member States to promote measures and policies that first of all foster greater awareness of the problem on the part of citizens. It also calls on the Commission and the Council to declare 2012 the ‘European Year against Food Waste’, precisely in order to raise awareness among institutions and consumers about the various kinds of damage caused by losing massive amounts of food along the food supply chain and, conversely, on the desirability of a change of course in this area.

Furthermore, food waste not only has ethical, economic, social and nutritional implications, but also health and environmental ones, because unconsumed food mountains make a major contribution to global warming and food waste produces methane, which, as a greenhouse gas, is 21 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. The European Parliament therefore calls on the Council, the Commission, the Member States and players in the food supply chain to address as a matter of urgency the problem of food waste along the entire supply and consumption chain and to devise guidelines for, and support ways of, improving the efficiency of the food supply chain sector by sector.

With the future of the Food Aid Programme for the Most Deprived Persons having been threatened over the course of several months, there is a need to encourage the initiatives of some Member States to recover unsold food and the distributors should also participate in these programmes.

      <p sl="pt">In view of the fact that an increasing amount of healthy, edible food – some estimates say up to 50% – is lost every year throughout the food supply chain in Europe and becomes waste, in some cases, all the way up to the consumer, I believe that it is crucial to vote for this report in order to prevent this catastrophe. I am voting for this report seeking to reduce food waste.

      <p sl="pt">Approximately 925 million people around the world are currently at risk of undernourishment. In the EU, 79 million people live below the poverty line, and of these, 16 million survive through food aid from charitable institutions. If we consider that the reduction of food wastage is an important step towards combating hunger in the world and improving people’s nutritional levels, it is unacceptable that almost 50% of perfectly healthy and edible food is lost every year throughout the food supply chain in Europe. There is a need to counter the growing trend of global food waste by adopting additional preventive measures, general guidelines and strategies aimed at improving the efficiency and sustainability of the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This will contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular, with regard to halving poverty and hunger by 2015.

      <p sl="sv">I have been a driving force in this matter and I support this report. In Sweden, we throw away a quarter of the bags of food we take home. That is environmentally, economically and morally unacceptable. With our more energy-efficient modern refrigerators, we could reduce the temperature in the supply chain for refrigerated foods in order to increase durability. We currently do not distinguish between the ‘best before’ date, which relates to quality, and the ‘use by’ date, which relates to safety. I have therefore asked the Commission to clarify these differences. With more types of labelling, we would risk confusing consumers more.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I do not agree with those who want to dictate from above. We must start to act now and not wait for detailed work to be done by the Commission. It is important for us to start at an early stage in schools. We need to teach our children to be careful with food. It is important to involve the food industry in providing information on how people can plan their shopping, store food and reuse leftovers in order to minimise wastage. We need to establish sustainable, informed and moderate consumption without compromising food safety. It is not possible to eradicate this problem with legislation. However, we can shape opinion, stimulate debate and increase awareness. The challenge that we all face is to change our attitudes and lifestyles. Everyone can make a difference, and together we can drive change.</p>

      <p sl="it">That the level reached by the data on food waste has an ethical significance, as well as a social, economic and environmental one, is no longer surprising. Yet, despite the ever increasing amounts – according to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates, it may even reach 50% of the total produced – of goods lost along the entire food chain, in Europe, there is still no clear, unambiguous and uniform definition of the concept of ‘food waste’.</p>
      <p sl="it">As if that were not enough, just a few months ago, we had to fight a fierce battle to refinance the fund for the distribution of food to the needy. In contrast to this is the data, deplorable in many ways, according to which Europeans and North Americans waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. This situation is no longer acceptable but, at the same time, it is hard to resolve.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the main virtues of this report is that it does not reduce the problem to its most obvious manifestation – waste generated by the end consumer – which, however deplorable, is but one part of a broader and more complex problem. Conversely, we need to identify intervention strategies tailored to the specific causes of waste for each of the five sectors (production, storage, processing, distribution, consumption) that make up the food supply chain.</p>

This is clear. We must act now, before it is too late for humanity as a whole. I therefore support the idea of designating 2013 the European Year against Food Waste. In addition to the comprehensive analysis and striking figures presented throughout this report, various measures are proposed to reduce food waste by 2025. I would emphasise only those that relate to expiry dates and initiatives aimed at encouraging sustainable small- and medium-scale production linked to local and regional markets and consumption. Action must be taken as a matter of urgency. The 50% reduction in food waste by 2020 proposed by the Commission seems to me to be an achievable goal.

In the United Kingdom alone, we throw away 7.2 million tonnes of food from our homes every year, and 4.4 million tonnes of this food could have been eaten. This issue has far-reaching implications for families across the UK, especially in the current economic climate. Food wastage costs the average family with children GBP 680 a year, the equivalent of GBP 50 a month. This brings the value of food wasted in the UK each year to a grand total of GBP 12 billion. Not only are there serious financial implications for the consumer in relation to food wastage, but there are also far-reaching issues surrounding the wastage of water, energy and packaging used in food production, transportation and storage. All of this goes to waste when we throw away perfectly good food.</p>

      <p sl="en">Food wastage is a serious global problem. It affects the entire food chain, from the producer to the final consumer, stretching from losses at harvest and storage through to poor securing of products during transportation, faulty packaging and the bad habits of final consumers when purchasing and using food. The paradox is that food is wasted both in industrialised and in developing countries. In industrialised countries, wastage occurs mainly during distribution and consumption, and is mainly due to the over-production of foodstuffs. In developing countries, food spoils right from the start of the chain due a lack of technology (for example, refrigeration equipment), the absence of transport systems and infrastructure and the lack of options for safe storage. There is little we can do about many of these factors: industrialised countries will not stop producing surpluses and the whole world cannot have advanced infrastructure and technology. However, we can do something right now about the disposal of food that can no longer be consumed. Most of this food ends up in mixed waste, and humanity thus produces millions of tonnes of mixed waste for which there is no space. The solution is to sort waste and to dispose of food biologically. Food recycled in this way can be returned to agriculture as natural fertiliser or humus. I welcome the start of the debate on this issue, and I will vote in favour of adopting the report.</p>

In addition to this problem being ethically untenable, since there are 70 million people living below the poverty line in Europe, it is also unsustainable in economic and environmental terms. Food overproduction has an enormous environmental cost, from energy wastage, water consumption and the depletion of natural resources, to greenhouse gas emissions. As such, it should be given priority in the European institutions by always safeguarding food security. I welcome the adoption of this report, for which I voted. I welcome and support the designation of 2014 as the European Year against Food Waste as a way of raising public awareness, and I hope that the proposed measures will be properly implemented so that the objective of halving food wastage by 2025 can be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report addresses a problem that has become increasingly worrying: food wastage. The rapporteur seeks a holistic approach to the problem, covering the various links in the food supply chain and making proposals to make the chain more efficient. However, there are some significant shortcomings and even misunderstandings in the report. The extent of the problem of food wastage today is inseparable from the capitalist mode of production, the intensification of agriculture and the increased size of chains of production and consumption. It is important to note that small- and medium-scale agriculture, short supply chains, and local production and consumption are likely to reduce wastage and increase efficiency. Everything cannot, therefore, be put on the same level, and it is important to make this distinction. Moreover, in the context of current food supply chains, proposals such as food redistribution programmes for those in poverty and the application of discounts for products that are nearing expiry, apart from their charitable and welfare-related nature, mean dangerously opening the door to dumping and manipulation by the big retailers, which we cannot accept.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Food waste has assumed such proportions that it can be considered to be a global problem that is reflected right along the food supply chain. It occurs on farmland, in the processing industry, in distribution companies and in consumers’ homes. Food is wasted in industrialised countries and in developing countries. The wastage of food generates a chain parallel to the production chain and causes a whole series of negative externalities. The issue of food waste conflicts with the fundamental problem of food security, which is seriously compromised by a number of factors, including the limited natural resources compared to the growth in the world population and the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. Combating food waste must become a priority on Europe’s policy agenda. The Commission, Council and Member States should strive to adopt strategies and specific measures to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain, and to raise public awareness of this problem with a view to remedying the situation. People must be informed not only about the causes and effects of waste but also about ways of reducing it. For this reason, Parliament requests that 2013 be declared the European Year against Food Waste, serving as a key information and awareness-raising tool on this important issue.</p>

      <p sl="it">Every year, about 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted around the world, roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption. It is estimated that every European citizen throws away on average 179 kilograms of food per year, much of which is still edible. We must start off from these figures in order to adopt a coordinated European strategy and effective measures that can dramatically reduce food waste. To date, the European Union has underestimated this problem, fraught with consequences that are not only social but also economic and environmental. Recent studies show that no less than 10% of greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries derive from the production of food that is then thrown away on a daily basis. With the resolution adopted today, we are calling for an integrated and coordinated approach to be introduced – from producer to consumer – to significantly reduce food wastage. Awareness raising and consumer education will play a key role in promoting the idea that what is wasted can instead become a resource. This has been successfully demonstrated by the ‘last minute market’, a project set up by the University of Bologna, which promotes the ‘reuse’ of food within solidarity networks.</p>

Wastage occurs along the entire food chain, from production to consumption. The report, moreover, defines five sectors: agricultural production, management and storage, processing, distribution and consumption. This wastage represents an environmental cost, since the production of unused surplus food requires the use of energy and natural resources, whilst entailing costs relating to the processing and disposal of the waste.

When faced with a phenomenon which, in the last 30 years, has increased by 50%, with consequences that are not only ethical but also economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health-related, it does not seem ethically sustainable for about 80 million people in Europe to live below the poverty line. The tonnes of still edible food that are thrown into rubbish bins require disposal, a process which is often very expensive at both an economic and environmental level, and one which society itself is forced to pay when it could be doing much, often unconsciously, to limit its impact. I therefore believe that today’s vote is the start of a regulatory path through which, in future, we will be able to reconcile the needs of consumers, in terms of hygiene and information, through differentiated and simplified forms of packaging that are cheaper for businesses and which, therefore, lead to lower retail prices.</p>

It advocates the ‘polluter pays’ principle in this sector. It emphasises the value of short chains and encourages the Member States to support local small and medium-scale production. It even asks for quantified food waste prevention targets by 2014. It contains so many good ideas that one regrets that this text is purely a declaration of intent with no enforceable proposals. I voted in favour of it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Food wastage has reached enormous proportions today, and should therefore be viewed as a global problem. It can be considered to be present throughout the entire food chain, from the producers to the consumers. According to estimates, more than half of our healthy and edible foodstuffs is wasted. The issue of food wastage contradicts the fundamental problem of food security, because the world’s population is steadily growing and with it, the access of the poorest strata of society to food is becoming increasingly limited, not to mention that the superfluous production of foodstuffs that are not consumed entails high environmental costs. The reasons behind wasteful behaviour, however, are not the same in every case. Whilst, in industrialised countries, the issue is chiefly concentrated around marketing and consumption due to the abundance of foodstuffs produced, in developing countries, it is caused by a lack of advanced agricultural procedures and safe storage options. These data clearly show that the amounts of food produced today should be reused for food purposes instead of simply being discarded like any other waste. The fight against food wastage should become a priority item on the agenda of European politics. A concrete strategy needs to be elaborated in order to cut food wastage in half across the entire food supply chain by 2025. I consider it extremely important to inform citizens not only about the reasons and consequences of wastage, but also about the methods of its reduction. I supported the report with my vote.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Wastage at the consumption stage amounts to 90 million tonnes annually, whilst around 16 million people in the EU are dependent on food aid. Today, more than a billion people are still suffering from hunger and, faced with this situation, it was high time that Parliament called on the Commission and the EU Member States to take practical steps at national level to halve food wastage by 2025. This is not just an economic, environmental and social imperative; it is also an ethical duty towards the most deprived members of society. Urgent strategic measures are required, by people becoming aware of waste in general. Awareness-raising campaigns, food education courses, improved, optimised packaging and ‘sell by’ labelling are all methods that would allow everyone to achieve respectable, tangible results.</p>

At the same time, food is being wasted around the world: in the field during agricultural production, during processing, during retailing and, finally, by end consumers themselves. In this connection, laudable initiatives have already been started in some countries, whereby food which would otherwise be discarded by shops is distributed to social centres. While, in high-tech countries, there is wastage at the processing and consumption stages, developing countries need to work on efficient transport and improved storage facilities for agricultural produce. In our part of the world, we like to legislate to reduce wastage in the production chain, but we do not like to legislate against the throw-away mentality of our modern society.

      <p sl="it">I wished to express my support for this report, as I feel it is essential for there to be an effective fight against food wastage. Recent investigations have shown that in Europe, the amount of healthy, edible food that is lost along the entire food supply chain stands at around 50%, a figure that is quite frankly unacceptable. The world population is continuing to grow and, in the coming years, the global food supply challenge needs to be tackled and solved. It is therefore only right that we should begin not to waste what we already have at our disposal. In addition to causing economic harm to producers and consumers, the wastage of food also has a significant impact from a social point of view, and that is why the actions should be encouraged to support the collection and recovery at local level of unsold or discarded but perfectly usable products, so that they may, for example, be redistributed to the needy. The European Union must be the standard-bearer for best practices in this area, and ensure that they develop throughout Europe: EU institutions themselves should lead by example, pledging to reduce waste in staff canteens.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Food waste in the ‘developed’ world and food shortages in the ‘developing’ world are relevant and closely linked topics. Unfortunately, with its common agricultural policy that encourages over-production, the European Union, one of the most developed regions, is also making a significant contribution to the fact that a large proportion of foodstuffs fail to reach those who most need them, and are discarded or otherwise disposed of. We propose addressing this issue by drawing up strategies and specific measures. However, I propose beginning with ourselves – next time, we should spend twice as long shopping for food, but think twice whether we really will consume one product or other, or throw it out once it has reached its date of expiry.</p>

      <p sl="et">I support Mr Caronna’s report entitled: ‘On the avoidance of food wastage: strategies for a more efficient food chain in the EU’, because I find that food wastage is an acute current problem that has not received sufficient attention. As living standards rise, we enjoy increasing choice and the availability of food products with aesthetic appearance, but we devote less and less thought to the sensible use of food. This is especially the case when the true extent of food wastage is invisible to the ordinary consumer, because the most extensive component of this wastage takes place during the phase in which food is produced and transported. In addition, consumers have become increasingly demanding regarding the appearance of food, and much food that is perfectly suitable for consumption is discarded solely due to its unsuitable appearance. There is also no reason why food that is approaching its expiry date should not be sold to consumers who are willing to purchase it for a lower price or even distributed as free food aid. Methods for the avoidance of food wastage are simple and readily available (purchasing the correct quantity of food, purchasing food produced by the producer who is nearest to the consumer, the proper storage of food, etc.), but these must also become ingrained among as many consumers as possible and be implemented among producers, suppliers and sellers of food.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcome this resolution because food waste is a global problem and this squandering of food generates an industry parallel to the production industry. Strategies for a more efficient food chain need to be established at EU level in order to address this issue. Combating food waste must become a priority on the EU’s policy agenda. Consequently, we need to improve the efficiency of the food supply chain and increase public awareness. I believe that the Commission urgently needs to assess the possibility of applying a policy of enforcement with regard to food waste and to set out specific food waste prevention targets. I welcome the proposal that when establishing public procurement rules on catering and hospitality services, priority should be given to those undertakings which guarantee redistribution of any unallocated items free of charge. Furthermore, we must enable consumers on low incomes to buy high-quality food at cheaper prices.</p>

      <p sl="it">The text we have just voted on is certainly of great interest considering the tonnes of food that are still usable but which are thrown away every day. The implementation of strategies for improving the efficiency of the food chain plays a significant role, given that the ‘culture of non-waste’ needs to be taught to all groups of citizens and encouraged through public measures for controls on products. Citizens must be involved in waste separation, in learning to reuse any leftovers that are still edible and with good information on the causes and effects, so that everyone can contribute to environmental conservation by reducing waste and increasing savings.</p>

      <p sl="el">Food wastage in the world has increased by 50% over the last 35 years. At the same time, the percentage of destitute persons in the EU, especially in the countries that have been hit by the fiscal crisis, has increased significantly. Europe must manage its resources more efficiently. It is important to note that, according to a recent study, Europeans and North Americans waste, on average, between 95 and 115 kilograms of food a year, as opposed to between six and 11 kilograms in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, most wastage is concentrated in the final stages of distribution and consumption, owing, above all, to the overabundance of food produced, whereas in developing countries, it is concentrated at the early stages, owing to the lack of advanced agricultural practices, effective transport systems, infrastructures and so on. More efficient management of food will guarantee more efficient distribution of it and food for those who do not have it. I therefore endorse the European Parliament’s call on the Council, the Commission and the Member States, especially in the midst of the economic crisis, to adopt strategies in this direction and to propose that 2013 be declared the European Year against Food Waste, which is why I voted in favour of this particular report.</p>

In a context of European-level crisis, where the waste of resources is inadmissible, and with the exponential growth of developing countries, which have new and increased food needs, as well as climate change, which are causing irreversible crop losses, the problem tackled in this report should be a priority for the EU. It is also worth emphasising, therefore, that in addition to the environmental damage caused by producing food that is not used, the costs of treating and disposing of the resulting waste and the loss of revenue for the companies that produce it should also be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for the Caronna report on an issue that is important for Europe’s households as it directly affects their spending and the value of making savings by avoiding food wastage. This is a trend that is becoming widespread as, according to a Commission study, food wastage in the EU’s 27 Member States amounts to 89 million tonnes (in other words, 179 kg per capita) and will increase by 40% by 2020. Too often, this wastage involves perfectly edible food, which is in no way waste; rather, it is discarded from the food chain for aesthetic reasons or, frequently, owing to the nearness of the ‘use by’ date. This is why I support the idea of promoting the primary sector and low food miles in the future common agricultural policy. Another action which is bound to produce results lies in increasing the number of channels for redistributing unused food for free or at sale prices. Supermarkets specialising in these products are being created. They meet a real social need in these lean years and times of crisis and the public administrations should encourage them.</p>

It is estimated, based on data gathered since 1974, that food waste around the world has risen by 50%. Waste occurs on farmland, in the processing industry, in distribution companies and in consumers’ homes; there is waste in industrialised countries and in developing countries. This squandering of food generates an industry parallel to the production industry and causes a whole series of negative externalities. The issue of food waste conflicts with the fundamental problem of food supply, which is seriously compromised by a number of factors, including limited natural resources as compared with the growth in the world population and the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. Hence, there has been a series of analyses and deliberations on the use we make of the food available to us.</p>

Food wastage can be seen at every stage in the chain, from harvest to consumption. The environmental impact of these failures is exacerbated and has knock-on effects on fisheries and energy resources as well as on waste management.

      <p sl="pl">The problem of food wastage is becoming increasingly serious. According to the European Commission’s data, the annual generation of food waste in the 27 Member States amounts to over 89 million tonnes, or 179 kilograms per capita. On average, 20-30% of food purchased in European households is thrown away, two-thirds of which is still edible. Moreover, if we do not undertake decisive steps and measures, by 2020, the total amount of wasted food will have risen to around 126 million tonnes. The implications of food wastage itself are not only of an ethical, economic, social and nutritional nature. Food wastage also has consequences for health and the environment, since food waste contributes to global warming. In agriculture, cases of food wastage occur both during the production process as well as in the storage of agricultural goods. In the food industry, food is often already being wasted during the collection of raw materials, as well as during transport, when it is carried over thousands of kilometres. However, the problem is most acute in the case of households. Excessive purchases, elapsed expiry dates and the lack of proper management skills in relation to foodstuffs result in food ending up in the bin.

      <p sl="en">I supported today’s resolution which calls for food wastage in the EU to be halved by 2025. A staggering 50% of edible food is wasted each year, even though 79 million EU citizens live beneath the poverty line. We need an effective EU-wide strategy to tackle the issue of food wastage. I believe that new awareness campaigns would help inform people on how best to avoid food wastage and to use food sustainably. Schools and colleges could explain the need for effective cooking, storing and disposal of foodstuffs, which could help reduce the amount currently being thrown away. I also echo calls to make labelling on food packages clearer, so that both ‘use by’ dates and ‘sell by’ dates are displayed – this would help consumers make a more informed decision when purchasing food. In addition, the use of local produce should be promoted in catering and hospitality and the redistribution of food to poorer people free of charge should be encouraged.</p>

      <p sl="de">I can only agree that we should put an end to the wastage of food. The figures are alarming: 60% of food waste in European households could be avoided. The Commission has come to the conclusion that a fifth of the food is thrown away because ‘best before’ dates are not used correctly. I can therefore only support the call for 2013 to be declared the European Year against Food Waste, with information and educational initiatives. We need citizens to be more aware, right from childhood onwards. We need to explain to our citizens what the ‘best before’ date means. The ‘best before’ date is not an expiry date. Consumers should use it only as a guide. The ‘use by’ date for perishable goods is different. These products should not be consumed after such a date. We all have a responsibility to prevent food waste across Europe and to create greater understanding.</p>

      <p sl="de">Food wastage around the world has increased by 50% since 1974. This not only contrasts sharply with the hunger in the world, but also gives rise to high and unnecessary environmental costs as a result of the production, preparation and disposal of food that is thrown away. It is therefore high time that the Commission, the Council and the Member States implemented specific strategies to combat this problem. Above all, it is important that citizens are aware of the causes of food wastage and are informed of how they can avoid throwing away food. I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Caronna has tabled a good report, which is why I voted in favour. It calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement specific measures to halve food waste by 2025, to improve the efficiency of the food industry and, in particular, to increase public awareness of this issue. We all have to do our bit here. The figures are alarming: in Germany alone, an estimated 20 million tonnes of food ends up being thrown away every year. Moreover, this is mainly happening right at the end of the food chain – in other words, it is being done by us, the consumers. Quite apart from the ethical issues of how we can allow this to happen when so many people do not have even the bare minimum, it also gives rise to environmental pollution and costs of disposal. We therefore all need to take a more sustainable attitude to food, and we politicians should impose fewer regulations on the food industry that only aggravate the problem. The German organisation Die Tafeln provides an example of a sensible option for reusing food that can no longer be sold. In Saxony alone, there are 35 Tafel , or table, charities; in Germany as a whole, there are around 900. Over 100 000 tonnes of food are donated to the Tafel organisations in Germany annually – unfortunately, that still leaves a lot of the 20 million tonnes going to waste.</p>

      <p sl="en">In my constituency of London, enough food to fill nearly 12 000 double-decker buses is thrown away every year. London is committed to cutting the amount of food sent to landfill. The London Food Board works hard to raise awareness of waste amongst both individuals and businesses. Household initiatives include residents using a specially provided kitchen caddy to collect food waste which is then sent for composting. Similarly, businesses are being encouraged to sign a ‘Food Waste Pyramid’ which asks them to avoid buying surplus food, redistribute any unwanted food to charities, and pass food unfit for human consumption to livestock. Many supermarkets and cafés in London have systems in place to give food at its ‘sell by’ date to homeless people, which is distributed via local members of the community. Food wastage is a problem for all EU countries. I therefore voted for this report as I believe we can share best practice across the EU on reducing the quantity of food waste that is being dumped into landfill.</p>
