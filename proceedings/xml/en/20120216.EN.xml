      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Juan Fernando López Aguilar, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the right to family reunification of third-country nationals living in the EU (O-000015/2012 - B7-0031/2012).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As the Chair of the Committee and author of the oral question is not present, I would like to give the floor to the European Commission, namely, Commissioner Barnier.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to reply to the question put to the Commission by your House and by your rapporteur, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, and to give you the opinion of my colleague, Cecilia Malmström, on this subject, for which she is responsible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, family reunification accounts for a large share of legal immigration in the European Union. Family reunification is decreasing, falling from 50% of legal migration in the 2000s to one third today. The migrants covered by the directive – that is to say, third-country nationals joining a non-EU citizen – account for 21% of all permits issued – 500 000 people for our 27 Member States in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like briefly to mention the content of the Green Paper and the issues it raises on the scope, the conditions required to exercise the right to reunification, most notably integration measures, and problems regarding procedure. There are also a number of issues relating to possible ways to prevent fraud and marriages of convenience, as well as the rules relating to fees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its 2008 report on the Family Reunification Directive, the Commission had already noted specific problems concerning implementation at national level, for example, cases in which visas were not issued in a simplified procedure to a person admitted as a family member. The Commission also identified shortcomings in the directive, where some of its provisions were too vague, for example, as regards the possibility of applying certain conditions, such as integration measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States called on the Commission, both at the time the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum was adopted in 2008, and in the Stockholm Programme in 2009, to continue developing this policy at EU level by giving special consideration to integration. The tendency of a number of Member States to apply stricter rules because of – in their opinion – problems of integration and abuse, has reignited the debate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taking all these elements into account, the Commission considered it appropriate to organise an open consultation at EU level. The Green Paper represents the most participatory approach. It ensures that all interested parties have the opportunity to be involved and to express their point of view. It also leaves us the choice of whether or not to act subsequently and as to the form that such action should take.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, with regard to your questions on human and fundamental rights, I would like, on behalf of Ms Malmström, to make three points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the directive recognises the right to family reunification as a necessary way of making family life possible. Secondly, as confirmed by the European Court of Justice, the directive must be applied in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in conformity with this Charter. This is particularly so with regard to the right to respect for family life, the right to marry, the right to found a family, and the right of a child to maintain a personal relationship with both his or her parents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Court of Justice confirmed in another judgment that the optional conditions laid down in the directive – for example, requiring the applicant for reunification to have sufficient financial resources – must be applied on a restricted basis so as not to interfere with the right to family reunification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third and final point is that the Green Paper invites interested parties to specify whether or not guarantees should be introduced so as to ensure that integration measures and fees are not used as a means to restrict the right to family reunification</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regarding forced marriages and fraudulent marriages, the Green Paper invites interested parties to provide further information to the Commission so that any problems can be solved in a more targeted way. On the one hand, the Commission is making every effort in the Green Paper to determine whether or not there is a link between forced marriages and the minimum age of the spouse, as a number of Member States have argued. On the other hand, it is asking for statistics on marriages of convenience that are known to have taken place and information on how the provisions covering checks and inspections could be more effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to stress the open nature of this consultation. Depending on the results of the consultation, the Commission will decide what needs to be done. Various options are available. Interpretative guidelines are an option and could be an effective instrument if accompanied by other tools, such as groups of experts and an in-depth dialogue with each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a follow-up to the Green Paper, in the second quarter of 2012, the European Migration Network will complete a targeted study to feed into the consultation process and the subsequent action taken. Whatever form the follow-up action will take, the Commission will ensure the correct implementation of the current EU rules on family reunification. If necessary, it will be prepared to open infringement proceedings.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 2003 Family Reunification Directive marks an important stage in EU migration policy. It recognises the right to family life of migrants who are legally established on the territory of the European Union. It supports their integration by limiting family separation and allowing them the stability and enrichment of family life.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not forget, however, that family reunification continues to be an important source of legal migration. The European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, adopted in 2008 under the French Presidency of the European Union, reflects the need to structure and frame this migration, taking into consideration the reception capacities of the individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a policy that is both realistic and humane. The human rights of migrants residing legally on the territory of the European Union must be respected, and their integration must be promoted, while preventing any abuse and taking our own limits in terms of reception into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In France, 29 400 residence permits were granted in 2010 to third-county nationals for the purposes of family reunification. In Italy, the number of permits was 160 200, while in Finland, 40 times fewer permits were issued over the same period.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The conditions for granting permits for the purposes of family reunification differ considerably from one Member State to another. Despite the efforts made, the level of convergence between national family reunification policies is very low. The European Commission has already stressed on several occasions that this is partially due to shortcomings and deficiencies in the transposition of this 2003 directive. It is always a good idea to consult civil society and the actors concerned but, above all else, it is important to ensure that the existing law is complied with and implemented correctly. If this is not the case, I call on the European Commission not to hesitate to be more reactive than it has been up to now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission has presented its Green Paper. Why is the current situation as it is, Commissioner, and what else do you propose?</p>

    <intervention id="4-012-000" speaker_id="96952" name="Sylvie Guillaume" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are having a debate on family reunification on the day before the consultation launched by the European Commission comes to an end. However, I am disappointed that our institution was unable to make a greater contribution to these discussions, and to do so in a more structured way, as other organisations or associations have done or certainly will do.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This being so, I should like to emphasise three, in my view essential, points concerning the spirit in which these rules on family reunification should be adopted, and even modified. The first point is that it is necessary to update the approach taken to date by emphasising, first and foremost, that we need to ensure respect for the right to family life. This must guide our thinking on the implementation of the directive, especially since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and, therefore, on the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with a view to accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point relates to the objective of the directive. Originally, this objective was to promote the integration of migrants. However, the directive has become, instead, an immigration management tool, the effect of which can legitimately be considered counterproductive in terms of social integration. Therefore, my question on this point is whether the original objective, that of integration, should not be more firmly re-established.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third and final point is that, in my view, the Commission should show itself to be more offensive, and therefore – let me spell it out – initiate infringement proceedings against a number of Member States which do not apply these rules correctly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The adoption of increasingly restrictive measures has been shown in several Member States to reduce the number of migrants settling in Europe for the purpose of family reunification. I therefore call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in the handling of the results of the Green Paper.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-013-000" speaker_id="96677" name="Cecilia Wikström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the family can provide people with security, safety and a sense of belonging in their lives. If, for various reasons, people are forced to leave both their country and their family, they will always carry within them the dream of being part of a family again, of being united and of belonging. That hope never dies.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission has now examined the implementation of the directive on the right to family reunification from 2003 and found that many Member States have problems getting this to work in practice. I therefore welcome the Commission’s new, clearer guidelines for the Member States. Many of the provisions are vague and new guidelines can help to safeguard the provisions that exist and may be a good tool for the Member States, but I am opposed to the introduction of new provisions and I seriously question the Commission’s timing regarding the release of this Green Paper on the future of family reunification.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If we open up the possibility of adopting new provisions, I believe there is a risk that the result will be worse than what we currently have and that fewer people will be reunited with their families. I would like to hear how the Commission intends to deal with the implementation of this directive with which several Member States are struggling so badly. Have any infringement proceedings been initiated? If no infringement proceedings have been initiated, why not? What excuse is there for that?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let us also remember that there is actually only one Member State, namely the Netherlands, that has requested an amendment to the directive, and it would need more than that for us to open the way for new provisions. International human rights instruments confer on us all the right to a family life, and this right to live together, to love and to belong is something that none of us should jeopardise. The directive must provide guarantees to protect the right to belong to and be part of a family with other people.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-014-000" speaker_id="96815" name="Judith Sargentini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as somebody else has already mentioned, this directive is designed to help people, to allow families to be together. Partners who want to be together, parents and children who want to be together, but who currently find themselves living in different countries, for whatever reason. However, it appears that Member States are using the directive to achieve the opposite result, to keep migrants out, to keep out what, in my native country, the Netherlands, are known as no-hoper migrants. That is blatant abuse of a directive intended to respect family life and also, therefore, to encourage us to observe human rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Countries are stretching age requirements: are you now allowed to get married at 18 or only when you have reached 21? Countries are imposing income requirements on migrants who want to reunite their families, income requirements which they are not imposing on home nationals. Countries are introducing more and more examination requirements: they are demanding that you must learn the language before you enter the country and are refusing to grant residence permits to those who do not speak the language. I see that happening in the Netherlands. I see that people are trying to get their partners across to the Netherlands, but if they happen to be illiterate, if they have never learned to read or write, then it will not be easy for them to pass the Dutch naturalisation test. What the Dutch Government is saying with this is: yeah right, you can have your right to family reunification, like that is ever going to happen.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore ask the Commission for clarification. Can things be allowed to carry on like this or should the European Commission come up with tighter rules to combat such abusive practices? After all, this is about family reunification and not – as I have heard my French colleague saying – about the absorption capacity of the given country. That is not what this is about. This is about people’s right to be able to be together. Could we, therefore, tighten the rules here to stamp out the kinds of abuse of integration law that we have been talking about, or might that, in practice, be unwise? If we open Pandora’s box, are we not going to get into a lot of trouble? The Netherlands seems to be setting a trend. Even Belgium is now using naturalisation rules in order to refuse permits, and France seems to be considering it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question we, this Parliament and the European Commission, are facing, thus, is: should we keep the situation as it is and try to prevent abuse by making court rulings binding throughout Europe? Should we try to use the directive for its intended purpose, namely, family migration, or should we try to modify the directive so that abuse no longer takes place? I must admit, I would like to see improvements, I would like to see the rules tightened, but I think that our policy line should be the following: we keep the directive as it is and we encourage citizens to go to court and win their right there to bring their partner across to Europe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is particularly important because it would appear that the vital, protected right of family reunification of third-country nationals living in the European Union is under threat. It is protected on paper at least, as many, including the European Commission, have judged its application to be problematic. That is why it is essential for us to look on the public debate started by the Commission as an opportunity to strengthen that right, and not – as some people are trying to do – to weaken it.</p>
      <p sl="el">Immigration policy and the credibility of the European Union are already being so severely tested and questioned that the last thing we need is for anyone’s rights to be undermined. A good start would be if we were to refuse to accept baseless arguments. The reality is that family reunification covers a very small part of immigration and, secondly, when the Commission repeatedly asks the Member States for data on fraud, they never materialise; at least they have not done so to date.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let us be brave enough to enact equal treatment, the treatment we would wish for ourselves, and to see things in their real perspective.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016-000" speaker_id="24030" name="Philip Claeys" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, with this debate on the directive on family reunification, the European Parliament is being overtaken by events for the umpteenth time. The problem is not that some Member States are not applying the directive or that they are not applying it correctly. The problem is that the whole thinking behind the directive is hopelessly outdated. Family reunification and family formation are among the largest sources of mass immigration to Europe. Very often, the people concerned do not speak the language of the host country and have no prospects of integration or finding work. The small amount of integration that may have been achieved is constantly being undone with the arrival of family members who have to start the whole process again from scratch. It becomes a bit like painting the Forth Bridge.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is why there is a growing awareness that this cannot be allowed to continue and that the option of taking restrictive measures must be made possible. We must abandon the one-sidedness of a directive that allows Member States only to pursue a relatively lax policy and not to have a policy which is any stricter. We also urgently need to abandon the misguided idea that, just because the right to family life is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this should automatically mean that family reunification can only take place in one of the European Member States and not in the country of origin. It is time that we stopped taking into account only the rights of immigrants, and that we paid attention to the rights of Member States and the rights of citizens and taxpayers in Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I merely wonder whether he has ever considered the idea that it could apply to him and his relatives. Is it not the case that the right to love ones children or parents applies to everyone, irrespective of the country someone comes from?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, my answer to Ms Wikström is that, emotional and sentimental considerations are all very well and good, but we need to be able to implement a policy. The facts are that a very large proportion of the immigration involving people who have absolutely no prospect of integration takes place in the context of family reunification, that that policy of family reunification is subject to widespread abuse and we, as policy makers, have to take that into account. This is not just about people who are forced to come here in very difficult circumstances and we also need to ask ourselves whether, in the majority of cases, such family reunification could be arranged in the country of origin, and that is effectively the case.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019-000" speaker_id="28120" name="Simon Busuttil" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="mt">Mr President, over the years, the Family Reunification Directive has done a great deal of good, since it has allowed several families situated in dangerous areas to be reunited under the protection offered by European law. At the same time, it has also permitted several immigrants to integrate within Europe by making it possible for them to live their family life. This is precisely why we should keep working on this directive, whilst ensuring that its purposes are still achievable in future. The Commission’s Green Paper on this directive, which we are discussing today, analyses this topic from different points of view. Yet I would like to take the opportunity to go further and also look at the issue from another point of view and mention those other countries which are, to this very day, facing disproportionate burdens owing to heavy immigration influx. Right now, for example, it is Greece that comes to mind. This country cannot even cope with the influx and the needs of the people arriving there, let alone were these people to be joined by their family members.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I also hail from a country, Malta, which has received a great influx of immigrants, and this already creates a disproportionate burden. Were the families of some of these persons also to be added, then the burden would be far greater. This does not mean that this directive, this law, is bad. Far from it. I have already stated that it is very good and very important. Yet it is important that in assessing this law, we view all perspectives, including the ability of Member States to implement it. If a directive is not viable, then it will be of no interest to anybody.</p>

    <intervention id="4-022-000" speaker_id="4519" name="Claude Moraes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the debate so far has shown, family reunification, of which I am a product – I joined my family in the European Union as an immigrant – is something which is extremely important and fundamental, and I think EU law and regulations in this area understand that this is a fundamental right. It is a fundamental right to be joined by your family, but, of course, you cannot divorce it from the context of immigration to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are doing today is perhaps not debating current EU migration policy but ensuring that we do not have the inconsistencies and unfairness that accompany the right for non-EU citizens who are already legally residing in a Member State to be joined by their families. This is a basic human right, and we should always remember this. Of course, the reality of the directive is that it is very imperfect. The discretion used by Member States has been so wide as to create some unfair practices. This Green Paper, therefore, is a chance to strengthen the guarantee of family reunification to non-EU citizens, but we must have what Mrs Guillaume talked about in terms of a proactive approach by the Commission to ensure that those inconsistencies, where they are deeply unfair, are ironed out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some Member States have called for more restrictive conditions to be added to this directive in order to tackle fraud and abuse. We really need to assess all of this and to ensure that what we are delivering here are basic human rights, but obviously in a realistic context of immigration to the European Union.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-023-000" speaker_id="28266" name="Sophia in 't Veld" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing here is a directive intended to facilitate family reunification. It is not about immigration policy. As Claude Moraes just said, you obviously cannot separate the two issues altogether, but let us keep a close eye on what the directive concerns. It concerns immigrants who want to build a stable family life. That will do a great deal to promote integration. People who are forced to remain alone while their loved ones and their families are living somewhere else are not living in a stable situation. It is, therefore, in our interests to ensure that people are able to live in stable family circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, let us remember that there are still a great number of people who are not entitled to claim this right, for example, cohabiting partners with children and same-sex couples. On this matter, I therefore welcome hearing the extraordinarily progressive recommendation given by the competent committee of the Council of Europe to the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, abuse should be discouraged and forced marriages is something that I seriously abhor. However, I have to get one thing off my chest, ladies and gentlemen, and this is a purely personal comment: saying that we have to use this instrument now to fight that sort of thing seems to me to smack somewhat of convenience feminism. If we want to do something to strengthen the position of women, then, frankly, I could give you a few better suggestions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We need to focus, especially, on improving the application of the directive, on ensuring, more than anything else, that the ambiguities can be ironed out, on greater harmonisation and on ensuring that application of the directive is more harmonised, instead of on increasing the differences in implementation between Member States. On that score, I am therefore pleased to note from the Commissioner’s words that there is no support for the restrictions demanded by the Dutch Government.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-024-000" speaker_id="4531" name="Jean Lambert" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we know that this is a difficult debate. It was difficult the first time round. Indeed, at that time, some of us who were in the House felt that the directive that we are currently discussing was too flexible and we launched a case before the ECJ concerning a couple of the provisions of the directive. Unfortunately, from the point of view of some of us, the ECJ found in the wrong way, but nevertheless it upheld two of the issues, not least about children joining their families.</p>
      <p sl="en">So while there are those who argue that this directive is unnecessarily lax, I think that we can see within the directive how we look differently at issues of flexibility. At present, four Member States covered by the directive are using it in a more and more restrictive manner, despite the rulings of the European Court of Justice. I think that is an issue that the Commission needs to look at. As someone said, the whole goal of this directive was in favour of family reunification as a measure of integration. Integration measures were meant to be part of the goal, not a barrier to family reunification. We know about people being asked to take language courses abroad when those courses do not exist and we know about highly restrictive costs in terms of coming to join family members. All of these measures are put in place to actually erect barriers. I believe, and my group believes, that those certainly need to be challenged.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also hearing a great deal about issues of marriage and whether marriages are genuine or not. This is, of course, incredibly difficult to determine, not least when you look at the divorce rates of some EU nationals. But, nevertheless, there are ways in which we can deal with this. Some Member States already have legislation in place on issues relating to forced marriage, rather than arranged marriage. The EU has programmes in third countries looking at the empowerment of young women and girls and indeed trying to change family attitudes on the issue. There are also measures that you can take at interview stage to try to establish whether it is a forced marriage or not. I am really interested that people are so concerned about this because a number of us in this House want to bring forward measures looking at the question of forced marriage. We look forward to support from some unusual sources in terms of women’s rights on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is flexibility in the directive. We know that. As I say, we have seen ECJ rulings that have tried to put a limit on certain parts of the flexibility, but I think that, rather than looking to open up the directive, we need to ask the Commission what it has been doing in terms of infringement proceedings. In 2008, they said this directive was inadequately transposed and inadequately implemented in a number of Member States. What has happened since to improve that situation?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I recently asked the Dutch Minister for Immigration and Asylum, Mr Leers, whether he, in his crusade against family reunification, had no compassion for people who love each other. His answer was: ‘Happiness in life is not a criterion which I recognise’. How can you say such a thing? And as a Christian Democrat, too! Did Christian Democrats not once call the family the cornerstone of society? Does Christianity not teach that love is the highest good? And does it not say in human rights conventions that family life needs protection? Not according to this minister who, in acting in this way, has turned his back on his origins and party.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the meantime, I have received a lot of e-mails from people who are desperate, who are unable to build a family life because of the current Dutch policy of naturalisation tests, inflated income requirements and excessively expensive residence permits. That applies to everyone, but to LGBT people in particular. Lawyers are now advising them to choose the Europe Route. That is to say that it would be in their best interests to move to another European country, because there is no other Member State that operates such a heartless policy as the Netherlands. How low can a government sink?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fortunately, Commissioner Malmström has consistently shown that, for her, happiness in life does matter. Abuse must be prevented, but Europe is not going to make it impossible for lovers to set up home together in one of the Member States. However, I have a bit of a problem with the Green Paper. With this paper, is the Commission not sending out a signal that the family reunification policy is up for debate? Would that energy not be better spent in punishing a minister who is a disgrace to Christian Democracy and to the community of values that Europe claims to be?</p>

These criticisms of a country, which, in the full exercise of its sovereignty, is adopting more restrictive rules on such a delicate issue, one so closely related to the fundamental issue of immigrant integration, call to mind an official government document, which will be presented today, of all days, in Rome. This is the eighth report on immigration published by the Italian National Council of Economy and Labour (CNEL) – an Italian constitutional body – showing that the Italian regions and provinces in which integration has been most fully and seriously implemented are those in the north, and particularly in the north-east: that is, precisely those regions – such as the Veneto – governed by the Northern League, a movement which many in this Chamber regard as xenophobic.</p>
      <p sl="it">This leads me to believe that it is precisely the adoption of strict rules, of a substantial immigration filter, that can lead to true integration. Moreover, this is what emerges not from a biased opinion, but from an official government document, with constitutional status in my country. Let us therefore examine these proposed rules. Are they rules fit for the Third Reich or are they reasonable norms? When an immigrant, in order to obtain family reunification, is required to demonstrate that he has a job, a certain economic stability, etc.; when strict measures are called for with regard to the shameful scam of forced marriages or marriages of convenience, all we are asking for is European standards. In short, what we want are standards compatible with European judicial culture.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the influx of family migrants entering the Netherlands this year will once again reach figures of over 40 000. Family reunification is therefore one of the main catalysts of this ongoing mass immigration, with problems such as cultural alienation, an increase in our environmental footprint and excessive strains on the welfare state. I would emphasise that this is an issue concerning family migrants. We are not talking about refugees who are at risk in their own country.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Netherlands is now asking for a widening of the European directive which will enable us to make our own decisions on migration. After all, each Member State is different. The Netherlands wants the scope to be able to pursue its own policy, as that has now become necessary, but Commissioner Malmström is of the opinion that the problems of one individual country are of no importance. Is she siding with the Europeans in this? No, Commissioner Malmström is siding with the immigrants. The Commission argues that entire families should be able to settle in the EU, but the right to a family life can be exercised just as well, if not better, in the country of origin. Commissioner Malmström is totally blind to the reasonable requirement that Member States should be able to make their own decisions in matters that concern their very survival.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I call on the Commission once again to put the interests of Member States and the interests of society first. Legislation ought to serve everyone’s interests, not just the interests of immigrants and those of the Commission in its ivory tower.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card question. – Mr President, Mr Zijlstra, I heard you saying that it should, nevertheless, be the case that the Dutch Government is allowed to decide for itself whether or not to allow family migrants in. That is actually the case already. My question to you is: are you aware that, in the majority of cases, family migration to the Netherlands concerns people who are coming to join a Dutch passport-holder? Whether that be someone who was born and bred in the Netherlands or someone subsequently granted a Dutch passport is another question altogether, but they are, therefore, Dutch citizens and holders of a Dutch passport who want to bring a migrant, their partner or their child, over to the Netherlands. The Netherlands should be able to regulate that on its own, but it is failing to do so. Why is that, Mr Zijlstra?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, Ms Sargentini wonders why the Netherlands is failing to apply the rules that are allegedly already in place. My answer is: the kind of rules we are talking about do not exist. The requirements which the Netherlands wishes to make partner migration conditional upon include, for example, a minimum income and, in certain cases, we may demand that partners apply for an independent residence right. It is the opinion of the Dutch Parliament that the measures in the European directive regulating these matters are still too limited. Therefore, what the Netherlands is asking is not that the directive be applied more stringently throughout Europe, but that the Netherlands be allowed to apply stricter rules of its own.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the debate in this House shows that we represent the entire spectrum of opinion: on the one side, we have those who do not want restrictions of any kind, while on the other are those who associate any form of immigration with the risk of a massive influx of people. These are the two extremes to be found within the House.</p>
      <p sl="de">Family reunification must be viewed with a great deal of common sense and rationalism. On the one hand, problems genuinely exist in Member States with excessively restrictive policies. After all, we cannot put so many obstacles in the way of reuniting families that, in the end, reunification becomes an impossibility. On the other hand, Member States are fully justified in demanding language skills and integration, for example, or at least a willingness to integrate within a state.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the Member States naturally have the right to point out the problems that arise with family reunification, problems that should not be swept under the carpet. If countries like Greece, Malta, Romania or Italy are no longer permitted to indicate the problems they experience in this context, then I am not certain that we are taking a democratic approach by simply ignoring problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do not need another new directive. We should debate the problems carefully and then consider how we can remedy them. The continuous production of new directives will not lead to an improvement in the directives or their implementation. We are currently experiencing implementation problems in some areas. I completely understand that we need to engage in debate first, rather than drawing up yet another new directive and adding something to it before we have thoroughly discussed the old directive and the associated problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am in favour of listening to the Member States and of respecting the basic right of family reunification. If this is done in a reasoned and understanding way, then we will also achieve some progress.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to talk about those issues that are, in my opinion, questionable. I include in this area the actual definition of a so-called intelligent perspective on acquiring right of residence.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This vague definition from the Green Paper may be unsafe, particularly if, in leaving Member States too much room for interpretation, it results in no third-country citizen being able to sponsor a family member. In some Member States, a potential sponsor must live within the territory of the state for at least two years before requesting the admission of a family member. Requirements such as this are made mainly in order to try and monitor the behaviour and financial situation of the applicant as a potential sponsor. This gives rise to a politically constructed temporal and spatial exclusion of families. Many non-governmental organisations have drawn attention to the fact that this is a breach of the right to private family life, as set out in Article 8 of the Convention. It may also be a breach of the right to married life and the principle of non-discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="sk">For this reason, I am in favour of shortening the procedure and the waiting time. The report on implementation of the directive and the Green Paper also list problems and shortcomings with implementation of the directive at national level. They both express concern over transposition of the directive. They conclude that Member States were given too much leeway in the application of some of the provisions.</p>

    <intervention id="4-032-000" speaker_id="2307" name="Hubert Pirker" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, when we hear talk of migration, many of us think of asylum-seekers and overloaded boats, a few of us think of controlled immigration, and almost no one thinks of family reunification. More than one third of immigrants enter the European Union under the aegis of family reunification and, in some States, this group makes up more than half of all immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Christian Democrats, we support the right to a family and the concept of family reunification. However, I would like to see the Commission take account of certain conditions and to incorporate them into its directive, for example, a provision stating that family reunification can only relate to the core family, that subsidiary persons with a right to protection will continue to be excluded – after all, the aim is for this group to return as soon as possible to their country of origin – that social security payments should be linked to acceptance of assistance with integration and that all forms of abuse should be effectively combated by every possible means. If these conditions are met, then family reunification will doubtless have a very positive effect.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, however, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we should be paying more attention to attracting professionals, specialists and highly-qualified people, as all the statistics indicate that we need these people to strengthen Europe’s economy and, in the final analysis, to enable us to sustain our social security, pension and health systems. As you will know, we are in close competition with the US, as well as Canada and Australia, for the best personnel. For this reason, it is important for us to create attractive and timely opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, the report on the implementation of the Family Reunification Directive and the Green Paper have both noted problems and shortcomings in implementation at national level. However, what some countries, including the Netherlands, have done is to try to turn the problem on its head. They are claiming that the directive leaves scope for abuse. Does the Commission have any evidence or have Member States provided any evidence which gives any credence to these concerns?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The EU needs a common immigration policy. Yes, but this is about the most fundamental of rights, that is what it is about, as well as about the right to a personal life and a family life and the right to marry and start a family. That also applies to refugees and the Green Paper is now considering whether they, too, should be included.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Is the Commission aware of the practice in the Netherlands of using the criterion of the actual family situation when it comes to the reunification of the families of refugees who have acquired legal status? Is the Commission aware that, when establishing the existence of such actual family ties, a biological relationship, for example, is not considered evidence enough on its own, but interviews are also conducted with applicants, including very young children, and, if what are deemed to be ‘incorrect’ answers are given, mothers are told that there is no valid relationship between them and their own child? What is the Commission going to do about this?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Netherlands is undoing fundamental rights and wants to reconsider the commitments it has made. Are we going to allow Member States to get away with reconsidering international conventions on fundamental rights? I do not want to hear an affirmative answer to that question. I want to hear from the Commission that it will guarantee that we in Europe will respect rights and keep them high on the agenda and not accept these callous proposals.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that family reunification is an issue of substance, one that is serious and concrete. The welfare of the family must take precedence over anything else, even if it is, of course, undeniable that this right must be subject to rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, the 2003 directive contains useful rules, though they must be applied uniformly and homogeneously within the territory of all Member States. For this reason, the Commission has quite rightly initiated a serious debate by publishing a Green Paper, in which it sets out a clear vision: to introduce concrete measures in support of a process of family reunification which, in my opinion, simply has to be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am the rapporteur of a document on information and communications technology, on the transfer of workers who are third-country nationals to establishments located both in third countries and in Europe. In this particular case, a more favourable exception clause was carried in committee to ensure family reunification at a practical level, which is definitely a political priority for the European People’s Party.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, language is important, and we must ensure that the European agenda on migratory flows – again in this case we are speaking of legal immigration – takes account of this directive, which is absolutely correct and practical. The Commission’s goal must be to urge Member States to adopt rules that can and will be applied in practice and, at the same time, ensure that the right to be together is truly recognised, one to which no one can object.</p>
      <p sl="it">The PPE’s aim is to ensure that the 500 000 individuals who are potential beneficiaries of this rule are given due consideration by Member States.</p>

      <p sl="el">There can be no doubt, and I wish to stress this point, that we all need to give this issue due attention. However, do you know what my fellow Greek citizens will ask me following this debate? They will ask me – as they constantly ask me – what, in the midst of all this discussion, is Europe doing, what are all of you doing, about the gangs that force even the facilitators, that force third-country nationals to get married, what are you doing so that we can develop infrastructures in the countries with the biggest problems?</p>
      <p sl="el">One hundred and fifty thousand illegal immigrants a year enter Greece. In the centre of Athens, there are areas that have become ghettos. What are you doing for all of us Greek citizens who are unable to leave our homes after nine at night?

      <p sl="en">Mr President, whatever the ostensible topic of debate in this House, the real objectives are first of all a steady incremental transfer of power from Member States to the centre, and, secondly, a dilution, not only of our national identities, but also of a more general European identity. The title ‘Europhile’ is most misleading.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rights to family life, to marry and to found a family, taken from the European Convention, were not drafted to facilitate the colonisation of Europe by the Third World. The real objective of this directive is not to safeguard human rights; if it was, the EU would care about the peoples of Europe who lose the chance of a house, or a job or see the areas in which they live transformed beyond recognition.</p>
      <p sl="en">These changes do not, of course, affect MEPs; they are doing rather well. A telling phrase in the wording of the question is: that Member States have been left with too much discretion. This directive and this question are about more power to the centre, so that we can have more immigration beyond the headline figure which is fed to the electorate. Is it desirable to reunify families? Yes, by reversing the process by which they became divided.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, immigration is often viewed as a threat. However, the benefit to the economies of the various Member States in terms of labour that is not only necessary, but also highly qualified in many cases, meets the development needs of a European Union faced with the trend of an ageing and decreasing population. In times of profound economic and financial crisis, like the one we are experiencing, austerity policies deprive the workers and the people of rights, which also makes the situation of immigrants more precarious and causes an increase in illegal immigration and work. We therefore advocate acknowledgement of equal rights for national and foreign workers with regard to access to jobs, to working conditions, to guarantees of economic, social and cultural rights, and to increasing the political rights of immigrants. However, we also advocate the right to family reunification, which must mean that family members have the right, not just to go to Member States, but to be integrated with their social, economic and cultural life.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We consider it crucial that all 27 Member States sign the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, quite apart from all humanitarian issues and the question of the extent to which the reunification of families is a fundamental right, it must be clear to all of us that such family reunification constitutes a direct entry into the social systems, rather than into the labour market. If we consider that the number of immigrants in most EU Member States has increased several fold in recent decades, while the number of people in regular employment has remained more or less the same, then we can clearly see what this means. The fact is that in many countries, up to 40% of immigrants live mostly on social security payments, which is also the consequence of the application of this family reunification provision.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, organised forced marriages and marriages of convenience are nothing new and are rarely uncovered. In order to restrict mass migration, it is certainly high time to tighten up our definition of the term ‘family’, instead of dealing with it with excessive generosity. We need to take a consistent, but well-founded humanitarian position on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, unfortunately, I was unable to be present from the very start of this debate on the oral question I put forward due to a problem of communication and coordination of parliamentary activities. However, I have been present for most of the debate and I have found that my question is indeed relevant.</p>
      <p sl="es">The directive on family reunification gave the Commission a mandate in 2003 to periodically report to the European Parliament on the state of implementation of the directive and any related problems. This mandate included the production of a Green Paper, which has been submitted for discussion.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the frame of reference for implementing the Family Reunification Directive has changed drastically since 2003, precisely as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon, which reaffirms the area of freedom, security and justice, thereby transferring the free movement of people within a certain group of states that have removed their internal borders to the Community pillar – in other words, to EU law. Then again, the Treaty of Lisbon also includes a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Articles 7 and 9 of which lay down the right to marry and found a family and the right to private and family life.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this context, a debate has arisen in a fair number of Member States concerning cases of alleged abuse in the implementation of the Family Reunification Directive. It is worth noting that this debate has been particularly heated in some countries where the immigration rate is much lower – and therefore the problem is less dramatic – than in other countries where this matter does not arouse such passion.</p>
      <p sl="es">The time has therefore come to analyse the real problems surrounding the implementation of the Family Reunification Directive, and to do so rationally, thoroughly, on the basis of reliable documentation, and avoiding all prejudice and smokescreens. Are there really any objective, hard facts that justify a debate on changing the terms of this directive? Are there really cases of abuse that justify changing the directive to make it more restrictive? Is it really a problem to establish, uniformly across all the countries in the Union, a maximum period for granting a uniform residence permit to the spouses, unmarried partners or underage children of people who already hold an EU residence permit and therefore have the right to free movement? What are the real problems this directive has given rise to?</p>
      <p sl="es">Leaving all the prejudice and confusion to one side, that is the key issue that prompted me to submit this oral question, and the one that needs to be discussed. I hope the work carried out by the Commission will help to shed some light on this debate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr López Aguilar has just said that it is a valid question and, honourable Members, the number, the quality and the liveliness of your speeches, which express very different points of view, show that it is indeed a pertinent and relevant question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to thank you, Mr López Aguilar, on behalf of my colleague, Cecilia Malmström, for having asked it, as it gives the Commission the opportunity to review the state of this consultation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to point out, echoing the comments made by Véronique Mathieu, Ms Sargentini, Ms Lambert and Ms Flašíková Beňová, that each of them, and others too, have highlighted the differences between the Member States in the application of current legislation. Honourable Members, it is precisely to fully understand, properly analyse and address the problem of this divergent application – which is different from one Member State to another – that the Commission has launched this consultation, which will be completed on 1 March, and in which all those who have something to say must participate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To fully understand, to make, as Mr Iacolino said, an attempt at clarity, is to accurately assess the imperfections of the current directive – I am thinking of what was said by Mr Moraes just now, recalling his personal testimony, because he himself is, he said, a product of family reunification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say, echoing the comments of Ms Guillaume, Mr Triantaphyllides, Mr Pirker and Ms Zuber, to whom I have listened, that, for the Commission, it is clear that family reunification is a tool for integration. For it to be implemented, consideration must naturally be given to the capacity of the individual States. That is what Mr Busuttil said, with great wisdom. Mr Busuttil also recalled the special case at this particular time, which is the exceptionally difficult situation in which Greece finds itself, and I wish to confirm that, as regards the capacity of Greece, Mr Busuttil, the Commission will continue to support a number of projects to improve the reception capacity of that country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Wikström, I would like to echo what you said by saying that it is indeed in response to the calls made under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and in the Stockholm Programme, and also in response to the very long list of problems identified in your 2008 report, that the Commission launched this consultation. We hope and, on behalf of Ms Malmström, I call for this issue to be studied and examined, completely, objectively and with reason – that is the word used by Ms Hohlmeier, who just now appealed to reason, with eyes open, without prejudice – I am using your words, Mr López Aguilar. We hope that this consultation will ensure the reasoned and objective examination of all the elements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also going to say to a number of you, who brought up the case of a particular Member State – Ms Sargentini, Ms in ’t Veld, Mr de Jong, Mr Zijlstra and Ms Bozkurt – that the pre-entry measures, which can be taken in any country, are not in themselves in breach of the directive. On the other hand, they are only acceptable to the Commission if they serve to facilitate integration and if they comply with the principle of proportionality. In this spirit, Ms Guillaume and Ms Wikström asked if the Commission has initiated infringement proceedings. At this stage, the Commission has not initiated infringement proceedings. The directive gives Member States wide discretion – I have just pointed out that they could use it, but only in certain proportions – and it has not identified violations of specific provisions of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the directive is not very specific. That is why we have launched this public consultation. The Commission continuously monitors the implementation of this directive by the Member States and, as I have already said, it is prepared, if necessary, to have recourse to infringement proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Claeys, if you see abuses – you spoke of this situation yourself – this consultation allows Member States to give us the facts and the statistics to enable us to fully understand the problems or the abuses and to know whether, at the end of this consultation, we need to propose a change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to finish by pointing out to Ms Mathieu and to Mr Mulder that the Commission has launched an open procedure, without prejudice, without ideology and, depending on the results of this consultation, we will decide what action to take. There are several options, which I mentioned in my first speech and will therefore remind you of. The most important of these are interpretative guidelines, which could be an effective instrument if accompanied by other tools, such as groups of experts and an in-depth dialogue with each Member State. If necessary, other provisions or other measures could be taken, but let us take the time to properly assess the results of this consultation, which will end on 1 March, and the Commission will act, encouraged by your own debate and your own recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, whatever follow-up action the Commission takes, we are going to ensure that the current EU rules on family reunification are implemented correctly and that – and I repeat this for a second time – infringement proceedings are not excluded, should this course of action become necessary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, I thank you very much and I thank your rapporteur, Mr López Aguilar, for raising this issue, and I note – and I will tell Ms Malmström – that the liveliness and number of the speeches demonstrate that that is a very topical issue.</p>

      <p sl="lt">A person’s right to live with family members, as well as the right and duty to care for children, to teach and educate them, and to live with them, are fundamental rights and duties that are unrelated to citizenship. Those rights should therefore also be respected and guaranteed for the citizens of third countries who have come to live in the European Union. I would also like to mention that there are many national and international declarations that take the same stance on this issue and recognise the rights and duties mentioned. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union lists the right to a family and family reunification as a fundamental human right. I appreciate that the European Commission has begun discussions on a revision of the rules on family reunification, applicable to migrants living in the European Union, but the Commission should consider very responsibly whether the directive provides for sufficient protection measures as regards family reunification, and we must ensure that it ends discrimination against the families of third-country citizens, because negative attitudes and intolerance towards migrants who come to Europe still exist. The Commission should also assess all the positive consequences of family reunification. Above all, the directive states that family reunification helps to ensure social and cultural stability, which creates a favourable environment for integration and facilitates the promotion of economic and social cohesion, beneficial for the local authorities of the host countries. It is also important to understand that the right to family reunification is a crucial step forward, making a tangible contribution to reducing illegal immigration and dangerous forms of social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, one of the Union’s highest priorities must be to ensure that an area of peace, development, justice and freedom, spanning both shores of the Mediterranean, can become an enduring reality.</p>
      <p sl="es">The association agreements entered into with our Mediterranean partners in the framework of the Barcelona Process were the first step towards establishing a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area. One of the main reasons why it was not possible to attain this objective in 2010 was the lack of social, economic and commercial integration among our Southern neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="es">The ‘Arab Spring’, as you well know, is the most momentous change since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In this regard, we should certainly congratulate the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and the Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, for having given the convention on which we are voting today a priority status among the different commitments that make up the Union’s response to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">This convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean rules of origin constitutes a major step forward in the establishment of the free trade area. Its adoption will ratify a single, simplified instrument which replaces more than 100 bilateral protocols currently in existence, and will broaden its geographical scope to include the Western Balkans and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), as well as the Mediterranean countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">The convention is therefore an incentive for South-South trade, and as such it may contribute to economic growth, economic diversification, the reduction of poverty, democratisation and integration in the region.</p>
      <p sl="es">I trust that over the course of this debate, the Commission will be able to provide a satisfactory response to the questions and concerns that this House has almost unanimously put forward in the form of an oral question and a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition to the absence of a dispute settlement mechanism, a review clause and an impact assessment, it is also important to address the importation and potential cumulation of origin of products originating – if you will forgive the repetition – from illegal Israeli settlements.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately, I have to add that, although the technical agreement currently in place between Israel and the European Union requires customs authorities and Israeli exporters to determine whether products exported to the Union originate from the settlements, the procedure does not contemplate this data being passed on to European customs. This prevents our customs, which are unable to examine each individual consignment coming from Israel due to the lack of a special budget, from complying simply and efficiently with international law and with their duty to deny applicability of the preferential treatment provided in the agreement between the European Union and Israel to products originating from Israeli-occupied territories.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe a commitment on the part of the Commission to determine the real origin of products exported by Israel in a better, simpler, more efficient way – taking on board the proposals set out in the resolution – would be most welcome. It would also garner broad support for the convention, thereby avoiding the possibility that this issue might become an obstacle preventing both its adoption and the social and economic integration of the Mediterranean region, a region of great significance for the European Union as a whole, particularly in the current circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague, Mr Menéndez del Valle, has already explained the reasons why the Committee on International Trade, of which we are both members, is recommending that Parliament give its assent to the conclusion of this convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin for free trade. In fact, this is not just a case of taking another step forward in building this Euro-Mediterranean free trade area and making it more consistent. It is also a case of encouraging regional integration on the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean by encouraging South-South trade; that is, trade between our Mediterranean partners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Indeed, the European Union, strong from its success as an area of economic integration, has always encouraged the economic integration of other areas. It therefore does not make us look bad to do everything we can to encourage others to follow us and take advantage of economic and trade integration in the same way.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As Mr Menéndez del Valle has already said, we are thinking not just of recommending the adoption of this report, but also of asking the Commission a series of questions, which we consider necessary in order to reinforce our belief in supporting this agreement. As such, we would ask the following questions, which Mr Menéndez del Valle and I wrote together, and which the rapporteur has already briefly mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, in order for this agreement to significantly support democratic transition on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, it will need to bring genuine economic benefits to those countries. Has there been any evaluation of the true positive impact of this agreement and of these new preferential rules of origin? Secondly, the convention does not include any conflict resolution mechanism. Could this be because the Commission considers – and I would like the Commissioner to justify this to us – the conflict resolution mechanisms already in place with many of these countries sufficient? The convention also does not include any revision mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Does the Commission believe that these rules will do for evermore; that there will be no need for periodic evaluation of these rules, so as to justify their future revision? Finally, there is the very politically sensitive issue that Mr Menéndez del Valle has already mentioned of products originating from Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. It is clear that we have to be absolutely certain that these products are unable to benefit from the trade preferences that the Union awards to its partners, including the Palestinian Authority and Israel. These products cannot benefit from these advantages, and that is the least the EU can do if it is not to be complicit in the illegitimate occupation of Palestinian land. There can be no doubt in this regard, and a strong commitment from the European Commission on this matter is essential.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Menéndez del Valle and Mr Moreira for this report and this question, to which I will reply on behalf of my colleague, Algirdas Šemeta, who regrets that he is unable to be here personally to reassure you, honourable Members, of the Commission’s total commitment to the gradual creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area and the social and economic integration of our southern Mediterranean partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Menéndez del Valle and Mr Moreira, you asked several questions, which I would like to answer accurately on behalf of Mr Šemeta. First, the regional convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin is one of the first practical responses to the historical and positive events that have recently taken place in the countries of many of our southern Mediterranean neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This convention is important for several reasons. First, it will promote trade between the European Union and its southern Mediterranean neighbours. It will therefore foster economic integration amongst them. It will then pave the way for a simplification of the rules of origin and their adaptation to the new economic order of the region. It will also enable other European neighbours, most notably, the countries of the Western Balkans, to integrate into the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area by offering them new opportunities within an enlarged trade area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, since I am talking about the economic integration of this region and its association with the European Union, I am expressing, as Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, the concern and the idea that one of the ways for this region which is opening up to democracy and the world, would undoubtedly be for these countries at the other side of the Mediterranean to succeed in first creating a common market amongst themselves. The other day, I heard the new President of Tunisia argue for the creation of such a market, which would facilitate trade, communications, the dismantling of borders and the removal of obstacles between countries, most notably, the countries in the Arab Maghreb. However, we also have tools, as I have just said, to move towards a free trade area, organised between them and us, beyond the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second question you asked me was whether a dispute settlement mechanism had been provided for in the body of the convention. Such a mechanism is indeed included under Article 33 of Appendix 1 to the convention. This, moreover, is logically where it belongs, insofar as the disputes that may arise between partner countries will concern essentially bilateral issues relating to the verification of proofs of origin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, the text of this Appendix will be legally binding and it will replace the protocols relating to the rules of origin, which are currently annexed to the bilateral free trade agreements between partners of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area. Thus, all the free trade agreements concluded between these partners will refer to the same rules of origin and therefore to identical dispute settlement provisions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third question you asked me was whether the convention and its Appendices could be revised at any time. For example, after several years of implementation and in the light of the experience gained, amendments may be adopted by decision of the Joint Committee, as precisely stipulated in Article 4 of the convention. I cite: ‘The Joint Committee shall adopt by decision amendments to this convention, including amendments to the Appendices’. We are not, therefore, in a totally rigid procedure, which will never move. In the light of experience, and you have cited a number of problems, developments are possible. This mechanism will be developed in the Rules of Procedure of the Joint Committee created by the convention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the fourth question, I would like to assure you, Mr Menéndez del Valle and Mr Moreira, on behalf of Mr Šemeta, that the Commission is monitoring the technical arrangement between the European Union and the State of Israel very closely and is taking the necessary measures to improve, if necessary, the functioning of the arrangement. The notice to importers on imports from Israel is currently being examined very closely for that purpose.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission services are examining, in close cooperation with the customs authorities of all the Member States, the possibility of releasing the list of settlements and publishing a modified version of the notice to importers. The objective of such a measure would be to oblige importers to verify themselves the post codes on the proofs of origin established in Israel which they intend to submit to the customs authorities of the EU Member States. This should, I believe, improve controls, with the task of verification being, in the future, shared between the importers and the customs authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To ensure that no settlement product benefits unduly from a preference in the European Union through cumulation with partners having a free trade agreement with Israel, the Commission believes that the best approach would be to invite these partners to negotiate with Israel arrangements that are similar or identical to that negotiated by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I want to state categorically that the Commission is satisfied with how the technical arrangement operates. That is why, today, it does not think it is necessary to change its legal status.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the answers that Mr Šemeta wanted to give to the four questions you wanted to ask the Commission.</p>

    <intervention id="4-053-000" speaker_id="28306" name="Ana Gomes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinions of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Subcommittee on Human Rights, and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this regional convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin could contribute decisively to developing the economic integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region, which is one of the main objectives of European Union policy since the Barcelona Process and is essential if the Arab Spring is not to fizzle out.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that our partners in the southern and eastern Mediterranean have been wanting the conclusion of this convention for a long time. To date, the countries of the South have underutilised the trade possibilities opened up to them by the European Union. In order to avoid bureaucracy, they have often struggled on, without ensuring that they are benefiting from the possible customs duty exemptions. Thanks to this convention, which will unify the tangle of over 100 bilateral agreements on rules of origin, the system will be more accessible and simpler for the companies of our southern neighbours. It will therefore encourage trade from the South to the European Union, but also trade between the countries of the southern Mediterranean themselves, including Libya, from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it needs to be understood that this convention on its own, however beneficial it may be, will not be enough to make the transformation that we want in EU trade relations with the southern Mediterranean. We can help trade among southern countries to grow, but we cannot force it on them. Our partners to the south face a pressing problem in removing the barriers that exist between them and establishing South-South trade agreements, specifically among all the countries of the Maghreb. There is a need for political change on the ground if the possibility of cumulation of origin, strengthened in the new convention, is not to remain underutilised. Political change on the ground is important, for example, on the Morocco-Algeria border. It is also crucial to observe strictly the political conditionality applicable to products originating from the Israeli settlements in Palestine or the occupied territory of Western Sahara, which we cannot allow to enjoy these preferential rules.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank my colleagues, Mr Menéndez del Valle and Mr Moreira, for their collaboration on this important issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are quite right, Commissioner. This convention marks an important milestone. It is the first practical implementation of the communication on ‘A partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the southern Mediterranean’ of March 2011. I therefore hope that it is ratified quickly after our vote, especially since it is already in force in some other countries in the area, and the European Union had vowed to be the first to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to draw your attention to a number of points. The first relates to the problem of products from the occupied territories, which, as a first step, calls for greater vigilance on the part of the customs authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point relates to the economic operators and the difficulty they have in getting to know, understanding and using the system of rules of origin. One solution could be more communication and technical support. I will use the example of the Export Desk , which was created in 2004. It is a useful tool for exporters from third countries, but it is relatively unknown. I have also noticed that the guide on the rules of origin has only been translated into English, whilst the rest of the site has been translated into Arabic. This may be just a detail but, given the complexity of these rules, it would seem to me that the users would appreciate having a guide in their own language.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point relates to the rules of origin. Our Committee is currently examining an own-initiative report on the trade and investment strategy for the Mediterranean. One of the rapporteur’s proposals is to bring together the rules of origin of the generalised preference system and those of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention. It would be helpful for us to have the opinion of the Directorates General for Trade (TRADE) and for Taxation and Customs Union (TAXUD) on this point. Is it feasible? Is it a good solution?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I call on the Commission to maintain the pace of the other reforms it announced last year in the March communication. Any delay could be interpreted as a negative signal by all the neighbouring countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating Mr Menéndez del Valle and Mr Moreira for their excellent work. This was a very good report and it was important to formulate a position on this situation. I believe that the Committee on International Trade has good reason to approve this regional convention. If we look back over Europe’s history, we can see that it was free trade that provided the original, informal basis for the European Union. It was free trade under social conditions – a point that should always be made in this regard – which contributed significantly to the uniting of the European Community to become the European Union and, in the final analysis, to prosperity within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we could now succeed in developing a similar system of free trade within the entire Mediterranean region, then I am convinced that this could represent an enormous opportunity for the Riparian States of the Mediterranean to improve their prosperity and, above all, to work together in peace, something that is not always the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a positive step that we have succeeded in replacing several hundred agreements with one single agreement. I believe that this will work. However, and here I take issue with the Commissioner’s answer, we should, of course, consider a more intensive form of dispute settlement. We still see that not everything is always harmonious within the European Union. That is why dispute settlement procedures really could make sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our aim must remain a general free trade agreement; however, we have not yet quite achieved this. As Ms Gomes has said, we cannot force anyone into this. We can only offer encouragement. However, I believe we have already taken a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Menéndez del Valle, who I congratulate, is a very important document as part of the effort we are making, in the Committee on International Trade and in Parliament as a whole, to define new rules and provide a different impetus for trade in the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is an essential task and one of the great challenges – taking advantage of the exclusive jurisdiction of the European Union on matters of international trade – to provide solutions to those countries that still today have vast untapped potential in terms of trade policy with us. It is not only a matter of bringing about greater stability and prosperity, but also of expanding the social and production base among those who may benefit from the trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, this convention should have three important effects: firstly, promoting South-South trade, now almost at a minimum in the Mediterranean; secondly, promoting market access for small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to operate what I call – as the rapporteur for another measure – ‘Trade for Change’, in other words, trade measures for countries undergoing democratisation in the southern Mediterranean – liberating economic and commercial processes in countries where the few oligarchies in power have centralised the proceeds from trade into their own hands; and finally, making this trade more readily understandable through simple rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem of Israel must also be addressed because otherwise, the credibility of Parliament is at stake. This is an important work: we often wonder why we have only now managed to simplify the 100 plus different regulations governing rules of origin.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is now important for everyone to ratify it as soon as possible. What is happening with regard to the ratification of the mandate of the European Investment Bank for the Mediterranean is not very encouraging, given that Member States are proceeding very slowly. We hope that there will not be the same delay for the convention.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in my opinion, this convention must not be concluded until it is explicitly excluded that goods from illegal Israeli settlements could benefit from preferential access to EU markets as a result. At the moment, it does open the door for that potentially to happen, which is not only wrong but it is also in contrast to official EU policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The settlements are a major tool of the occupation of the Palestinian territories. According to official Israeli land records, one third of the land within the settlements is privately held by Palestinians. Over 600 of the Palestinian-owned structures which were dismantled last year were located within the settlements and last year, five Palestinians, including two children, were killed, and over a thousand people were injured, by settlers or by security forces in incidents related to the settlements. These settlements must be dismantled immediately.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead of opening a loophole for these goods to come into the EU market with preferential access, in reality, the door to the EU market should be shut altogether.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this new convention represents a major simplification of the various existing provisions. That is a good thing. It could provide a boost to trade, economic growth, poverty reduction and the southern Mediterranean countries’ mutual social, commercial and economic integration. This dossier has been labelled by the Commission as a priority within the framework of our response to the Arab Spring, as it has become known. In the light of current developments, democracy does not seem to have been an obvious outcome of these insurrections. Let our trade policy, therefore, not be a naïve one.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Though I speak in favourable terms of this new pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, I would like to express my disapproval of the accompanying resolution. Ten of the 19 recitals and eight of the 20 paragraphs are devoted to the alleged incorrect application of the implementing rules of Protocol 4 of the association agreement between the EU and Israel. This seems to me to be not only disproportionate, but also inconsistent with the statements made by the Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union last year, to the effect that this agreement is being satisfactorily implemented.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, it is well known that difficulties exist with the administration of the current web of bilateral protocols in relation to the rules of origin between the countries and regions of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone. If these are now changed, then I believe that care should be taken to ensure that income in the relevant regions does not result in a less favourable situation than under the previous free trade agreements. After all, this strategy is intended to consolidate and promote the free movement of goods between the EU and the partner countries in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">In principle, the ban on duty drawback on diagonal trade must be upheld in the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone. This is not without its problems in the case of the Palestinian Authority for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. There are frequent disputes in this region relating to the actual country of origin of goods. As the agreement is currently undergoing an overhaul, it would be a positive thing if the EU were to pay greater attention to this problem. In the context of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin, new provisions should be sought that will efficiently put an end to misuse.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the political importance of the convention under discussion today will be clear to everyone. The European Union is well consolidated, but a further process of integration within the confines of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world on its borders is a prerequisite for strengthening this region in the new global balance of power.</p>
      <p sl="it">Once again, a modern framework for trade relations may be a useful point of compromise between those who believe that Europe should primarily have an Atlantic vocation and those who believe that a new balance of power in the Mediterranean is essential for building a democratic future for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">This convention brings together in an improved multilateral, if interregional, logic, all the different positions currently in force concerning the origin of goods traded with the participants in the Barcelona Process, the EFTA States, the Faroe Islands and all of the Balkan States participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process.</p>
      <p sl="it">By adopting a legal instrument of this kind, it will be easier in the future to have recourse to the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin, and therefore agree on preferential tariff treatment for Mediterranean goods, although the absence of a review clause and uniform provisions for the settlement of disputes must be lamented. Precisely for this reason, the convention may be an important element to help revive a process which began in Barcelona almost 20 years ago and to which various initiatives refer, some more convincing and effective than others, but all of them important, such as the Union for the Mediterranean, the trade road map agreed under the framework of that process.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ours is an ambitious goal, but a slow-moving one due to the imbalances that are still too strong between the two shores of the Mediterranean, the political instability that is still crossing the Middle East – which requires greater effort from the European Union to push Israel to respect the international agreements on the Occupied Territories – and on account of the uncertainties linked to the evolution of the Arab Spring in North Africa. These are all major outstanding issues, which require a strong political and diplomatic initiative from the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome the fact that trading relations are to be established with a view to creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area in response to the Arab Spring, and that the over 100 bilateral protocols are to be brought together in a single regional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would, however, like to draw attention to one critical point, namely, products that purportedly originate from Israel. There have been some serious flaws in the implementation of the association agreement between the EU and Israel concluded in 1995. We in this House are all aware of this. I recently drew attention to precisely this flaw in a written question to the Commission. We know from several sources, including our customs authorities, that Israeli settlers have intentionally falsely labelled goods produced in the occupied Palestinian territories, including fruit and vegetables, also issuing these goods with falsified certificates, declaring the country of origin of these products to be Israel. This was in order for this produce to gain access to the EU’s single market at preferential conditions, including lower tax rates.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot have a situation whereby this new agreement will also be misused in further extending this illegal practice. Mr Barnier, I believe it is extremely important that the aforementioned list of the designations of origin of the various Palestinian villages and towns should be published. Our delegation has long been of the view that this list should not be kept secret, but should be published in the interests of greater transparency and clarity and to help restrict abuses.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, events in the southern neighbourhood of the European Union have led to a rethinking of the political and trade relations with the countries in the Mediterranean area. A first step in this direction was the awareness that the principle of conditionality towards democratic reforms, the pillar of the European Neighbourhood Policy, was more a concept than a real incentive for their achievement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Today, we have a duty to support the democratic aspirations of the citizens living in these countries. Greater economic and trade integration can contribute to the achievement of this objective. Therefore, I consider that the regional convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin must be concluded. I share the rapporteur’s conviction that this will facilitate trade between these developing countries, thus contributing to the reduction of poverty and to economic growth and diversification. The changeover to the Euro-Mediterranean system on the cumulation of origin, consisting of over one hundred bilateral protocols on a regional instrument, will reduce the complexity of current regional trade rules. It should also be noted that this change applies not only to the southern neighbouring countries, but also to the countries of the Western Balkans or the European Free Trade Association. Countries with a weak economy, such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, can take advantage of an integrated system of the rules of origin.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, an appeal has been lodged in this House for the European Commission to work quickly. In my opinion however, the value of the work of EU institutions should not be measured in terms of speed but in terms of positive outcomes. Otherwise, we will be dealing with a fiasco, as in the case of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). I would like to warn against this, first of all.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the debate itself and a careful reading of the document clearly suggest that this is not a black-and-white matter. Significant questions and controversies exist in relation to various issues, which were voiced by previous speakers from different sides of the House. It seems, therefore, that this is not such a simple and straightforward issue. Finally, when discussing the free market, we should remember that it is entirely divorced from certain political decisions. This has also been discussed here. We have to decide whether we are taking certain decisions in order to increase trade and provide more detailed trade regulations, or whether these decisions are strictly political, and are – in one way or another – designed to support the EU’s neighbours that, to a greater or lesser extent, are in need of such support.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The devil is in the detail, as the old saying goes. I therefore unequivocally agree that certain issues, such as subsidies for exporters or effective customs inspections, need to be defined with great precision and in great detail, and that we should clarify the definition of genuine goods.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this convention cannot be viewed in isolation from the role given to international trade by the European Union. It cannot be viewed in isolation from a vision of international trade geared towards competition and not complementarity; from the tired dogmas of free trade; from the tiresome and repetitive announcements of the glittering rewards that they assure us it will bring and that are repeatedly proven wrong by reality. Forget talk of the Arab Spring: as always, what is at stake is business; it is expanding and consolidating an unregulated free trade area. That is the case now, as it was before with the ‘friendly dictatorships’ with which the association agreements were concluded. The outcome is always the same: multinationals and big business are the winners, and small-scale producers, the workers and the peoples are the losers. This is the protection for the rich and powerful that always results from a lack of rules.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At this point, we would also like to mention Israel and the unacceptable lack of mechanisms making it impossible for that country to use trade preferences for products originating from the illegally occupied settlements in Palestinian territory. The Commission urgently needs to take measures to change this situation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank each and every one of you for your substantial contribution to this debate and now, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Šemeta, I would like to provide some answers. However, I would first like to thank Ms Saïfi and Ms Gomes, as well as Mr Susta and Mr Cutaş, for reminding us that, with this convention, we are convinced that the European Union is sending a strong message to all its partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Ferreira, contrary to what you said just now, this is not a matter of rhetoric. This goes well beyond rhetoric. Despite the economic crisis we are currently facing, we are committed to bringing our economies closer through these controlled exchanges with our Mediterranean partners and others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For us and for our pan-Euro-Mediterranean partners, we have a shared interest in seeing democratic, stable, peaceful and prosperous societies in the southern Mediterranean. Mr Leichtfried had it right earlier when he said how trade could be useful, since these countries need to work, to prosper and to develop, not only for themselves. This is not about a self-sufficient economy; it is about an open economy, agricultural products, manufactured products and tourism exchanges, which will allow economic progress to take place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Leichtfried also stated, quite rightly, that that was how the European Union was born almost 60 years ago. We Europeans resolved to live together. We expressed not only the desire to live together but also an interest, a need to come together through the economy, business and trade. That is also what I referred to earlier as a common market perspective among the countries, most notably, the countries of the Arab Maghreb, with which we could, thus, probably establish a partnership more easily, from a common market to a single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, once this convention has been adopted – and I hope, as Mr Rinaldi hopes, that it will be adopted quickly – it should facilitate the revision of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin. This revision has been eagerly awaited by our partners in the area for a number of years. It is therefore now a priority and it must be concluded so that it can come into effect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to confirm to Ms Ana Gomes, Mr Rinaldi, Mr Murphy and Ms Thein that, with regard to products originating in the Israeli settlements – I spoke about this in great detail in my first speech – they will be refused preferential tariffs precisely because of the technical arrangement and, Ms Thein, the verifications must be carried out on the basis of post codes. This is a shared responsibility between the importers and the customs authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have also taken note of Ms Tokia Saïfi’s suggestion of a translation into Arabic. If I have understood correctly, the guides in question are those of third countries on the rules of origin. I do not know whether it is up to the European Union to do the translation or to the countries concerned. In any case, I think that it is a good suggestion. The services of Mr Šemeta will look into this to see who can do it in the most effective way possible. In any case, all these translations, not only among ourselves, but also with others and in their language, are one way to facilitate cooperation and dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Leichtfried earlier raised the issue of dispute settlement and its proper functioning. We do, in fact, need a procedure for the settlement of disputes not only amongst ourselves but also in our relations with third countries. It is useful, first and foremost, at bilateral level. To address this issue of dispute settlement at bilateral level, we can apply the rules given in the relevant Appendix. If disputes have to be settled at plurilateral level, reference will therefore have to be made to the convention itself, to the introduction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Rinaldi touched upon the simplification of the rules of origin. Yes, we must move in that direction, and the convention is precisely the tool that will enable us to achieve this simplification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Mölzer rightly referred to incidents of abuse, which must be stopped. It is, in my opinion, the responsibility of the Member States to act to stop this abuse, and our feeling, our analysis, Mr Mölzer, is that the Member States are correctly fulfilling this responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, that is what I have to say in response to the questions asked and the points raised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank the author of this question and the rapporteur for their speeches and respond to the contribution by Mr Czarnecki, who expressed certain doubts, that I hope that this debate and the explanations I have given on behalf of Mr Šemeta will have dispelled a number of doubts, questions and reservations on the implementation of this convention, which must now, with you and thanks to you, take place quickly.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, thank you for your kindness in giving me extra speaking time. I do not think I will need it, as all the arguments have been presented in sufficient detail and all the relevant issues have been clearly laid out.</p>
      <p sl="es">First and foremost, I would like to conclude this debate by congratulating all the parliamentary groups for their outstanding collaboration on this report, and particularly for the broad consensus we have achieved on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, allow me to point something out with regard to the issue of postcodes, which you mentioned. I believe it is fair to say that there are sources even within the Commission that doubt the reliability of the postcode list. Besides, the postcode system would not reduce the burden on European customs in any noticeable way. I think this point should be taken into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nonetheless, I absolutely agree, of course, with what you said in your first speech: that the solution to the problem of eliminating poverty and achieving social and economic growth lies primarily in integration of the South itself, cooperation, and South-South cooperation in particular. That is the general frame of reference for this issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, with regard to your statement that the Commission does not envisage changing the technical agreement currently in place between the European Union and Israel, I would like to make a couple of points: firstly, given that the Commission does not intend to change this technical agreement, I would urge it to at least endeavour to guarantee that the agreement is strictly complied with and to ensure that all its terms are met in full; secondly, I would also urge the Commission – not just Commissioner Barnier – to bear in mind that the position Mr Moreira and I have defended in this sitting, and have persistently defended as members of the Committee on International Trade, is, in fact, the position held by the majority in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thank you for making an efficient and brilliant contribution to this debate, Commissioner. Thank you, Mr President, for your work in this House and for having explained – I will now make use of the extra time you granted me earlier – that the Members of the European Parliament should make an effort to avoid speaking too quickly, as this hampers the work of the interpreters, and the effectiveness of this exchange of views is impaired as a result.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome this new convention which now provides one single and simplified instrument for pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin. It is aimed at aiding the process towards democracy unleashed by the Arab Spring. However, a very serious problem exists whereby products manufactured by Israeli producers in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) are exported under the terms of the EU-Israel association agreement. The EU’s position is clear; the European Council has concluded that settlements are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible. Indeed, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has specifically ruled in the Brita Case that the application of the EU-Israel association agreement to goods manufactured in Palestine is illegal. Moreover, the EU Heads of Mission have reportedly recently recommended in their report that products manufactured in settlements should not benefit from preferential treatment under the EU-Israel association agreement. The Commission must revise and upgrade the EU-Israel Technical Arrangement to a legally-binding agreement which ensures that the new convention does not perpetuate or create a situation which facilitates or encourages the abuse of the rules of origin.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The objectives pursued by this regional convention: to replace more than 100 bilateral protocols with a single protocol; to integrate the countries of the Western Balkans into the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of rules of origin; and to facilitate trade between the member countries, are contributing to the economic integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region, which has been a major objective of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean policy since the Barcelona Process. In addition, its conclusion has been sought for a number of years by our partners in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. After all the talk that accompanied the Arab revolutions, it is time to take action. The adoption of this convention will enable the EU to send for the first time a clear message of openness to trade to the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are finally opening up to democracy. However, the convention alone will not suffice to bring about the major changes we are expecting in the EU’s trade relations with the southern Mediterranean. We therefore need to continue our efforts to support the development of South-South trade, to improve customs cooperation, to modernise the rules of origin themselves and, more generally, to review EU trade policy towards our Mediterranean partners, in that it should take more account of their interests.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The launch of the Barcelona Process in 1995 initiated the development of mutual cooperation in the Mediterranean area in the fields of politics and security, economics and finance, as well as social, cultural and humanitarian partnership. Efforts in these three areas were continued by the establishment in 2008 of the Union for the Mediterranean, with one of the ultimate objectives being the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area. The introduction of preferential and harmonised rules of origin, which, in particular, allow for diagonal cumulation, which, in turn, offers further support for goods produced in the different countries, is a significant step forward in the economic development of the region. It is of particular importance when the convention is to be signed by 42 countries. At the same time, the introduction of harmonised rules will make it much easier to conduct business, which consequently allows for an increase in economic activity. This also leads to strengthened cooperation, improved stability and security as well as to shared development on the basis of partnership, all of which were the founding principles of the Barcelona Process and remain its core objectives.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Norbert Glante, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the future of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) (O-000325/2011) – (B7-0027/2012) (2012/2509(RSP)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-074-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the question posed by Mr Glante concerning the European Earth Monitoring Programme (GMES), which is one of the flagship programmes of European Union space policy included in the Europe 2020 strategy, is important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will not reiterate all the information that GMES can provide, which is vital for the environment, the protection of biodiversity, the state of the oceans, understanding climate change, reacting to natural disasters, prevention and policy development. This information is necessary to enable all public authorities in the Member States, sometimes also the regions, to implement all these reparation, prevention or environmental protection policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">GMES has demonstrated its effectiveness. My thoughts turn to the major disaster that struck the island of Haiti in January 2010. Satellite images provided by GMES enabled the European Union to provide all the international players and emergency services working on the ground with reference maps showing where the damage had occurred.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I say that because, before I became a Commissioner again, I had the opportunity to work in the area of civil protection on the idea supported by my colleague, Kristalina Georgieva, of a European organisation for a better civil protection response. In this proposal, I, personally, four years ago, imagined using satellite services to provide a more effective prevention and reparation response, as we were able to do during the major disaster in Haiti.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, GMES data and services are also used for propagation simulations in the event of oil leaks, for example, from the Costa Concordia during that recent disaster.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In budgetary terms, honourable Members, what are we talking about? Since 1998, overall financing for GMES until 2013 by the European Union and the European Space Agency (ESA) amounted to more than EUR 3.2 billion for the design and initial implementation of the services and infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After 2013, the continuation of this programme, which will include the deployment of observation infrastructure, as well as the operation and maintenance of the services, will require a budget of EUR 5.8 billion approximately for the period 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a recent Euroconsult study on the observation of the Earth by satellite, we noted that, at global level, receipts of EUR 2.5 billion were generated in 2010 from data sales services, which means that these receipts are three times greater than 10 years ago. This is, honourable Members, a rapidly expanding market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, a cost-benefit analysis carried out by the Commission found that the GMES programme should generate profits at least four times higher than investment costs for the period until 2030. GMES has not experienced any delays or cost overruns in the past and is not likely to do so in the future, given that it is based on a structure which, if necessary, enables the priorities of the content of the objectives of the different components to be redefined so as to stay within the planned costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The communication of June 2011 on the budget for Europe 2020 placed GMES outside the multiannual financial framework. In accordance with financial regulations, a legal act, that is to say, in this case a regulation, is no longer necessary, as there is no financial undertaking. The communication to the European Parliament and to the Council, which was adopted in November 2011, thus seemed best suited for opening a debate with the other institutions on how to guarantee the long-term success of GMES. This communication contains, in an annex, the elements that may be included in an international agreement between the Member States to replace the regulation that will expire at the end of 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, GMES undoubtedly remains an important EU programme. The Commission was of the opinion that the costs of GMES could not be borne solely by the EU budget, considering the limits imposed in it. It is a way of ensuring the continuity of the programme while, at the same time, enabling the European Union to continue to be in full compliance with its international commitments. It must be recognised that the structure of the EU budget makes it difficult to finance major programmes, like GMES, the duration of which far exceeds that of the financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the Commission repeated on 30 November in its communication, it considers that it is firmly committed to the success of GMES. If, as proposed, a GMES fund is established by the Member States, the Commission will present, in legal form, a proposal for its implementation. The timetable will depend on the establishment of the financing fund by the Member States within the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Discussions on GMES are taking place at this very moment in the Council and, in this context, there will be an exchange of views on this subject in the Competitiveness Council on 21 February. GMES will provide information which will make it possible to tackle issues ranging from climate change to border surveillance, as I have just said. That is why I think that it is an important programme, which we must continue to support, in one way or another, with the Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="4-075-000" speaker_id="1902" name="Norbert Glante" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise. The Parliament building’s lifts were very busy. Perhaps the manufacturers should think about including a priority override function. That is why I am a little late.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I am much obliged to you for answering these pressing questions. Forgive me if I repeat myself a little, but I simply want to emphasise a point – I believe that the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme is one of the two leading initiatives in the European Union’s space policy and is of key importance for the monitoring of the Earth. This, in turn, is an indispensable instrument in the fight against climate change, environmental pollution, disaster prevention and security, sustainable development, mobility and crisis management.</p>
      <p sl="de">GMES was established as a Union programme and will receive funding of about EUR 3.2 billion from the budget until 2013. The lack of a workable financial plan for long-term, solid financial support would probably mean that the costs will rise in the long term. The programme and the associated supply of data could be temporarily suspended or even abandoned entirely. In the final analysis, this could mean that the investments previously made will have been in vain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe could lose its independence and technological edge in relation to this important space infrastructure. What is at issue? We are talking about a sum of EUR 5.8 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, admittedly a very large amount of money, but one that offers a very substantial economic benefit. Despite the current budgetary difficulties in many Member States, GMES must be sufficiently financed in the budget and through the financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barnier, you wrote us a letter recently. If I might quote you: ‘Europe should not be satisfied with defensive answers to the crisis – however important this may be – Europe must also open up the prospect of new growth for its citizens!’ This idea could be expressed very succinctly. It is possible to drive oneself to destruction through excessive savings. This principle applies in a different context to an important Member State of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">If GMES is to be run on an intergovernmental basis in future outside the budget, so that Parliament would no longer have a say in the project, then, in my opinion, the European space strategy would be doomed before it even began. This is why we are calling for a legislative proposal from the Commission for the long-term administration, financing and implementation of GMES and the embedding of the budget in medium-term financial planning.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Danish Presidency announced conclusions for the Competitiveness Council on 21 February and then cancelled them again because there was no majority in the Council. Some Member States question whether the Council Working Party on Space should be responsible for this project, which I find particularly surprising. Unfortunately, this development in the Council has given rise to two camps. One camp, a group of Member States that fund GMES through the budget, has also written to you. A second group wants to follow the proposal tabled by the Commission. If this stalemate continues, I fear that GMES may fail and that an enormous opportunity will have been lost.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is quite apart from the fact that many millions of euro already spent on the project will have been spent for nothing. The greatest risk, however, is that we will set a precedent, and that the Member States will use this to justify activities outside of the Treaty of Lisbon. I thought we had put these times behind us. I have three demands.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, I hope that we, the European Parliament, will be courageous enough to continue to finance the major projects of the EU, such as GMES, but also Galileo and ITER, through the budget and to establish separate budget lines with sufficient reserves for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I hope and demand that the Commission tables this legislative proposal as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I call on the Council to push through reasonable and sufficient funding within the budget and to take the necessary decision.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to express my support for what my colleague, Mr Glante, has just said. However, on the future of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), it is true that today, we have not established common ground.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is far more than just GMES at stake. The ambition to safeguard our growth is very real, above and beyond both the technological and environmental aspects mentioned by Mr Glante. We are also finally calling for a Europe of projects, which Mr Barnier has promoted so much, including during the European election campaign.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its efforts to exclude GMES from the multiannual financial framework, and by dragging its feet over the adoption of a new regulation on the implementation of GMES after 2014, the Commission is casting doubt on the future of this programme. More seriously still, it is casting very real doubt on its ability to actually take on extremely ambitious projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Would Mr Barroso – I am sorry, Mr Barnier – for once show some courage and initiative, particularly on this project. In my view, he has indeed shown very little courage or initiative during this parliamentary term, and I say this very clearly. Take action on this project, which is so vital to our competitiveness and for boosting employment. We truly need it at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, we are very active in the European Parliament. In September, we signed a letter addressed to Mr Barroso. We adopted the report on a space strategy for the European Union, as Mr Glante mentioned earlier, asking you very clearly not to abandon funding for GMES.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, through this oral question and this resolution, we have done so again. Mr Barroso should listen to this message, to the messages from those who have been directly elected by Europe’s citizens. The European Union should not abandon a project to the Member States after initiating it and funding it up to now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I endorse all the requests made earlier by my colleague, Mr Glante.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 on the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and its initial operations, for the period 2011-2013, will expire in 2013 and, unfortunately, the Commission has not come up with a new proposal for a regulation. GMES has enormous potential in terms of economic growth and job creation, due to the development of innovative services. GMES provides critical information for sustainable management of the environment, improving the protection of biodiversity, monitoring and forecasting the state of the oceans and atmospheric composition, understanding the determinant factors and the effects of climate change, addressing natural or man-made disasters, supporting policy development and strengthening the security of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The GMES service component provides access to information to support the following areas: monitoring the atmosphere, monitoring climate change, the adaptation and mitigation policies, emergency management, land monitoring, marine environment monitoring, and security. GMES applications and services include: space monitoring of air quality, monitoring of toxic algae growth, disaster response training based on data from space, increasing the safety of shipping in the Arctic regions, quantification of the solar energy received by the Earth, satellite tracking of pirated ships, monitoring of volcanic eruptions and their effects on air travel.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On 9 February, the European Space Agency signed contracts to launch two new satellites in 2013: Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 of the five-satellite constellation of the GMES programme. We reiterate the request addressed by the Parliament to the Commission within the framework of Resolution 19 of January 2012 concerning a European Union space strategy that benefits its citizens and urge the Commission to finalise the legal framework and clarify the approach to effective governance. We urge the Commission to include GMES in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. Please note that the lack of a financial plan providing long-term economic support could ultimately mean that the investment made to date has been fruitless.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, GMES has a vital role to play, particularly in the fight against climate change. It will deliver accurate scientific information about how climate change is affecting the planet, the land, the sea and the air. GMES will therefore be key to Europe’s long-term security, so it is crucial to guarantee a stable financial framework for the future development of the programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am deeply concerned about the funding proposal from the Commission putting GMES outside the next multiannual financial framework and making it subject to a voluntary intergovernmental agreement. That is no way to finance a strategic security project, and indeed we know that no intergovernmental agreement has yet been reached. We know that some Member States have indeed expressed objections to paying for GMES from their national budgets, so how will the Commission ensure that enough money is found, given the current national budget constraints?</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a further principle at stake here. Climate change affects us all in different ways and all EU Member States need access to GMES. It contradicts the principle of open access if those Member States who pay more start demanding better conditions of use. GMES will lose its status as a European Union flagship initiative, and it will lose its independence as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">So what are the alternatives? If GMES was within the MFF, then funding could come from the agriculture budget and the Structural Funds, as well as from Horizon 2020. Equally, innovative financing mechanisms such as project bonds could be explored, allowing private capital to be leveraged. The decision on how to finance GMES is in the hands of the Commission and the Council, so, Commissioner, will you reconsider this question of how GMES is to be financed?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as Vice-President of the Parliament’s Sky and Space Parliamentary Intergroup, I fully support Mr Glante’s motion for a resolution on the future of GMES and I echo his comments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The primary aim of the European Earth Monitoring Programme, GMES, is to provide information services which give access to accurate data and information in the fields of environment and security. In practice, this means managing natural resources and biodiversity, observing the state of the oceans, monitoring the chemical composition of our atmosphere and providing essential support in the event of disasters such as tsunamis, famine, oil spills, etc., and very serious accidents. The role of the aid agencies is made infinitely easier when they can pinpoint the areas which need help. This is one of Europe’s flagship space initiatives and we should be proud of what it has already achieved and what it can offer to all of us in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this in mind, I cannot understand why the Commission has indicated that GMES will be funded outside the multiannual financial framework. Member States are already in great difficulty, and I have no confidence that they will come up with the goods. Uncertainty with regard to future funding will be detrimental to hundreds of thousands of people, many high-tech, high-skilled jobs and a supply chain throughout Europe which is growing and developing thanks to the project.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, this Parliament has consistently supported the Commission’s position on the EU space programme, but you cannot chop and change and expect us to say nothing.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, Europe’s future in space is of paramount importance, and we as MEPs have a responsibility to ensure that space policy remains high on the agenda. Likewise, the Commission has a responsibility to guarantee effective long-term governance and financial management of key EU space projects. If the Commissioner does not want to listen to me, my colleague, the next speaker, Mr Vladimir Remek, was the EU’s first astronaut, so maybe the Commissioner will listen to his comments.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Europe does not, unfortunately, have many projects in which it is unrivalled at a global level. GMES is a unique example of such a project. It is therefore odd that we do not have the funds in the EU’s financial framework after 2013 for a project that we claim is one of the basic components of the Europe 2020 strategy. Even with the crisis, we should be capable of setting priorities both for the EU, and in a way that should be understood by Member States in particular. The sum needed for the GMES system to operate is, moreover, remarkably small compared to the vast amounts we are drawing on to fix Europe’s bottomless pits of debt. Pumping hundreds of billions of euro into these pits is mainly about protecting the profits of the banks. The EU is meanwhile often seen as a collection of hidebound bureaucrats. We must show that this is not the case with GMES, and that we are capable of programmes that better the lives of EU inhabitants, as well as the excellence we long for.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, as Commissioner Barnier said, the implementation of the European Earth Monitoring Programme (GMES) could generate profits far above the costs of investments, as well as economic growth and jobs. The Commission proposes to finance GMES, starting with 2013, from sources outside the EU budget, from a fund made up of the financial contributions of the 27 Member States, according to their gross domestic product. This type of funding is detrimental to the project. A community approach is essential because it will enable synergies with the management of the Galileo programme.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At international level, by removing the community dimension, the EU loses credibility in front of the international actors in the field of space industry. GMES should continue to be financed through the EU budget, in order to ensure its sustainable development and use, in the medium and long term.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Council’s message of January is very clear: GMES must be financed under the multiannual financial framework in order to benefit from a credible and stable financial plan that would ensure that GMES services will have the same level of accessibility in each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission not to jeopardise the independence of the EU and the development of space technologies and to speedily table a legislative proposal for the proper long-term operation of the GMES. The GMES programme must be implemented in a manner consistent with EU policies. This plan would be an extremely valuable indication for research and the industrial environment in the preparation of technologies and products that facilitate the use of these services.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have been defending the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme since I arrived in Parliament and I now feel the need – after letters, oral and written questions, resolutions, meetings, debates, hearings and newspaper articles – to remind those who seem to have forgotten what the benefits of this programme are, as listed in a publication written, among others, by the NEREUS Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies.</p>
      <p sl="it">Here are just some of the areas that the EU will put at risk without GMES: air quality, monitoring of climate change adaptation, EU water policy, the INSPIRE programme for geospatial information, civil protection and emergency services, agriculture and forests, services to the marine environment, monitoring of illegal activities, energy management and urban mapping. To these I would like to add the support, in particular to African countries, for all the technology currently needed to manage the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">Given this non-exhaustive list of the merits of GMES, could Commissioner Barnier – who I am sure is an advocate of the benefits of GMES – explain who it is that does not wish for the GMES programme to operate as it has done so far, and why? Why is the Commission hiding behind Council decisions, when we have evidence that at least eight major countries have asked to put GMES back into the multiannual financial framework? Who is insisting (and why?) on adopting an intergovernmental approach with an agreement that would make Parliament’s control of one of the most important space programmes much more difficult, rather than facilitating it as required by the Treaty of Lisbon?</p>
      <p sl="it">Let it be known that we are friends of GMES: the Commission seems to agree, and claims simply to be following the orders of the Council, the Council itself substantially agrees, and the regions are clamouring for GMES to be fully implemented. It must also be noted that, at this time of crisis, GMES is one of the few sectors where jobs are not being slashed and in which European companies can still boast a competitive edge. Parliament has repeatedly expressed its full support for GMES.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner Barnier, please tell those in the Commission and its services who are against GMES that it is time to stop. We have to work for Europe and for its young people, so as to make their future less hopeless.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Blue-card question. – I would like to ask Mr Prodi whether he knows that, with the help of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), the amount of solar energy received by the Earth was quantified more accurately. Thus, GMES has shown that desert areas receive more solar energy in one day than the total energy consumed by humans in one year. This represents a huge potential, especially given that energy is becoming a scarce resource. The African continent would primarily benefit from using this energy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, in my opinion, it is extremely important to achieve maximum synergies between the Galileo and GMES programmes, with regard to existing European capabilities, thrift and efficient programme management over such an extensive space sector. These are some of the reasons why I consider it right that the Global Navigation Satellite Systems Supervisory Agency (GSA) be entrusted with managing the GMES programme.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In the area of space research, however, we must proceed so as to avoid a funding threat to EU flagship programmes. Concerning the funding, I therefore prefer a solution that would ensure continuation of the GMES programme after 2013, but I am concerned that a solution involving a special fund would bring many question marks and uncertainties. In the discussions over the multiannual financial framework, I will therefore support incorporation of the GMES programme, provided, of course, that we minimise negative impacts on the priority areas of cohesion policy and transport infrastructure development.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, on 29 June 2011, the European Commission published this unacceptable proposal to finance the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme outside the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Eight months have passed, eight months during which the Member States and the European Parliament have intervened to firmly express their opposition and to call on the Commission to see reason on this matter. Must we still remind the Commission, as several of you have done, that GMES will have an impact on the daily lives of our fellow citizens by providing them with essential services? That is why we are all fighting for its survival, against the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This financial disengagement is difficult to understand for everyone involved, Commissioner, when you, yourself, acknowledged the exemplary nature of this flagship programme. As things currently stand, if we were to summarise the Commission’s position, it would be as follows: ‘If you wish to see this programme survive, finance it yourselves’. Today, the Commission should open its eyes to the reality of the crisis. We cannot ask our countries and our citizens, once again, to make more funding available.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission, could you today explain the reasons behind the EU’s disengagement from these programmes, when they give Europe real added value? Furthermore, without getting into technical details, could the Commission justify to our fellow citizens its intention to exclude Parliament from this programme, thereby ruling out all democratic control?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am calling on you today to express a clear, strong, reasoned position. We cannot allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the future of this programme; all the actors in this market are waiting with baited breath. This dialogue of the deaf runs the risk of paralysing the market, affecting a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises within our borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The idea of GMES is to enable the EU to be independent and to maintain the technological advantage that our businesses have been striving to achieve for years.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the GMES programme is instrumental in allowing the EU to make real progress in developing a comprehensive space strategy. As others have said, the programme will give the EU the ability to directly monitor the earth and its atmosphere and will assist, when fully functional, in handling emergency management of natural disasters.</p>
      <p sl="en">The case for past investment through the EU budget was convincing, and I believe that it remains so. The programme has made real progress from purely R&amp;D to an operational stage. We cannot risk putting further development of the programme in jeopardy with a proposed move for it to have to rely on intergovernmentanl funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current austerity measures being implemented in many Member States would suggest that if this were a discretionary intergovernmental spend, it would not be incurred. In the field of R&amp;D, it is critically important that the EU budget is used so that longer-term investments are made today in order to fuel the economic competitiveness and growth of future years. It is one of the few programmes I continue to support, believing that investment at EU level will add value and will contribute to the formulation of sound, scientifically-based policies and, hopefully, generate commercial opportunities as the programme matures.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Commission has clearly committed a serious error, and as it will have realised today, Parliament is calling, almost unanimously, for this error to be rectified. The vote on this issue will be very significant and I hope that the Commission will take that into account.</p>
      <p sl="it">Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a European programme of great excellence, whose funding cannot be entrusted to intergovernmental agreements. Some Member States have already expressed themselves in favour of this change of course. This programme is of vital importance for Europe from a political, strategic and technological point of view. We cannot afford to lose either the independence or the technological advantage we have gained and leave space to the Russian and US superpowers. That would also create serious inequalities between Member States. We must act quickly to provide a clear schedule for planning and investment purposes.</p>
      <p sl="it">We often speak of growth, innovation, scientific research, advanced technologies, investment in industry and quality jobs. Well, GMES encompasses all of this. In this Parliament, we often discuss the fight against climate change, environmental degradation and desertification; we discuss civil protection and security, sustainable development, mobility, crisis management and aid to developing countries. Well, GMES is essential for all of this.</p>
      <p sl="it">A half-finished programme is equivalent to throwing out significant investments that have already been made, and at times such as these, when the value of fiscal discipline has been rediscovered, that would be very serious. If European integration is democratic, the Commission must listen to the voice of Parliament and the Council. A final consideration: to maximise investment on the part of the EU budget, industry can be involved in a public-private partnership.</p>

      <p sl="it">Commissioner, I believe you are now faced with a rather unusual situation: you have before you an entire committee – the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – which, together with speeches from many other MEPs, are calling on you to clarify a number of issues: we are discussing a great project, one that – like the Galileo and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) projects – is a flagship of European policy, which goes above and beyond single national policies; a project shared across the board, as you will have noted; a project already funded in part and, indeed, already partly implemented.</p>
      <p sl="it">Faced with this situation, the concern and the bitterness of Parliament are more than justified after learning that the Commission seems – and I hope we can continue to use this word – to have decided to abandon the project, transferring to others – in particular Member States, at such a difficult time – the determination to continue the project, taking away this Chamber’s power to review the new regulation, as had been decided in 2010.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Global Monitoring for the Environment and Security (GMES) programme is the only one of its kind in the world, and symbolises a Europe that promotes projects for industrial cooperation, the same Europe that speaks to our fellow citizens. GMES means innovation, employment, industry and industrial policy. Those are words that should call out to us during this time of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, this programme is directly threatened by the European Commission’s proposal to withdraw it from the EU’s financial framework. In addition, the launching of the Sentinel satellites, planned for 2013, cannot be guaranteed in the current context if there is no visibility as regards the funding that will enable the satellites to operate once in orbit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The interruption of this programme and the subsequent delays will unavoidably lead to higher industrial and budgetary costs as a result. It is vital for this type of industrial programme to continue in order to contain costs and strengthen its efficiency. At a time when we are trying to reduce our spending, changing the course of this programme risks doing the opposite and making costs skyrocket.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this difficult economic period, the numerous subcontractors cannot consider investing if there is a lack of predictability. GMES must therefore be consolidated and, in order to do so, it must receive sustained and continued support from the European budgetary framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To that end, the Members of the European Parliament are calling on you to review this proposal so that GMES can become the symbol of industrial and space policy in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to welcome Mr Glante’s initiative to address this oral question. I believe there is a need for funding the European Earth Monitoring Programme beyond the year 2013. In this context, I would like to emphasise the involvement of the European Space Agency in its development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The component for emergency situations, SAFER, ensures the drafting of reference maps in just six hours after the initial call. For my country, this mechanism has proved particularly useful in many situations. Let me give you just a few examples: in June 2010, the Romanian authorities were able to get a complete map of the areas affected by flooding due to this programme. In November 2011, the same mechanism was called on to identify fire outbreaks near Sibiu. The operation was carried out with the support of the Romanian Space Agency.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in order to meet the ever increasing worldwide challenges, Europe needs its own well-coordinated and reliable Earth monitoring system. Once operational, GMES will limit the impact of natural disasters, such as those in Chile and/or Haiti. GMES cannot prevent these disasters, but it will make the rescue operations more efficient, as images generated by GMES can identify the areas with problems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the case of Romania, often affected by flooding, the destroyed infrastructure can be located, and the population can be evacuated and helped effectively through this system. According to a cost-benefit analysis, it is estimated that the GMES programme will generate benefits worth at least twice the costs of investments by 2020, and four times the costs by 2030. This represents a tremendous potential in terms of economic growth and job creation through the development of innovative services and commercial applications in the downstream sectors.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I heard Ms Sartori say earlier that I was in an unusual and somewhat uncomfortable position, but as a Commissioner, that is only to be expected because I have to express beliefs – and even do so both on behalf of my colleague, Mr Tajani, and on my own personal behalf – on the usefulness of this programme and also explain the budgetary difficulties we are experiencing, which have drawn your criticism and comments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, as regards the substance of this issue, it so happens that I was Minister for the Environment in my own Member State, as Ms Dati and Ms De Veyrac are well aware. These matters have been of interest to me for a long time, and I am very committed to issues of civil protection. Therefore, Ms Ţicău, Ms Hall, Ms Băsescu, Mr Luhan, Ms Foster and yourself, Mr Prodi, you are right to point out the major strategic importance of a programme like the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) for everything related to prevention, creating the right conditions for managing certain types of disasters, climate change management, and environmental management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Prodi, you were quite right to bring to mind the fact that some of the most fragile countries, including those of the vast African continent – for my part, I mentioned the question of Haiti, with which I am fairly familiar, and it is a country I am very attached to after the major natural disaster it suffered – are, of course, among the most favourable and opportune when it comes to using all the tools offered by GMES. There is no doubt about that. There is also no doubt that Vice-President Tajani, on whose behalf I am speaking, and the Commission are determined to make a commitment to major projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms De Veyrac, as regards everything related to the independence of Europe and industrial policy, I am very keen for us – I am speaking personally for the moment – to find together the same boldness in the area of industrial policy as that shown by the founders of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the Galileo project, which some have mentioned, and GMES. I believe that Europe should once again become a production centre and not simply a territory that consumes goods made in China or the United States, and I shall be saying as much again in other circumstances. Therefore, Mr Abad and Mr Tatarella, honourable Members, this is not a question of abandoning or suspending this programme, to which we should make – to use Ms De Veyrac’s words – a clear, strong, reasoned commitment. That is our approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having mentioned the importance of this programme, its strategic nature and Vice-President Tajani’s commitment to it, the fact remains that we are experiencing budgetary problems. We should say things as they are. I say to Ms Dati, Mr Marinescu and Ms Swinburne: why has the Commission proposed to finance this programme outside the multiannual financial framework? Quite simply because of its cost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to the funding granted to Galileo, over which we have full ownership, this option cannot currently be supported by the EU budget alone, simply because of the budgetary constraints that we have to take into account. The time required to reach and maintain the operational level of this programme goes well beyond the period covered by the financial framework. That is why the scheduling and implementation of the GMES programme cannot follow the same logic as that of other EU programmes for which the rules and limits of the financial framework still have to be rigorously applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I certainly appreciated your appeal. As you requested, I shall inform President Barroso and Mr Tajani of your questions and wishes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Swinburne, I was very sensitive to your call for Community financing. I should like to remind us all that the proposal for GMES, and I say this to Ms Hall, is to follow a similar approach to that previously used for the European Development Fund (EDF), which our legal services have confirmed would be entirely legal. I would like to say to Ms Ţicău, and to Ms Hall, that the European Commission’s current proposal anticipates a fund that should be financed by all the EU Member States, given that GMES is of equal benefit to all 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall therefore pass on your message. I should like to say to Mr Prodi, who always takes great interest in such issues concerning the environment and GMES, that it is true that the eight Member States you listed have officially requested, in a letter to the Commission, that GMES be reintroduced into the financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have observed – without malice, simply to be objective – that of those eight Member States, some have also written to us to ask for the European budget to be contained within the strict ceiling of 1% of GDP, and even for it to be reduced. We are therefore in a difficult position in our dialogue, which explains why no agreement has yet been established between all the Member States within the Council. The Council was unable to reach a joint decision on competitiveness and we will be returning to this point soon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I should also like to say to Mr Remek, Mr Marinescu and Mr Abad, who mentioned space policy as a whole, that we indeed need to take a different approach to the two questions that make up this major space issue: Galileo and GMES. Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) are owned by the European Union, and it was therefore only natural that we should continue to take general and collective responsibility for their funding. This is not so for GMES, because the development phase was cofinanced by the Commission and we do not have ownership of the infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am aware that these answers will not satisfy you. They are subject to the contradiction that exists between our continued industrial, spatial and economic ambitions and the budgetary constraints that we have to take into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, honourable Members, on behalf of Vice-President Tajani, I shall inform my colleagues of your questions, your criticisms and your expectations on this major issue.</p>

It should be technically the most advanced programme in the world in the area of environmental monitoring, helping to ensure greater security for European citizens and a better system of humanitarian aid, contributing to the sustainable development of the EU and, last but not least, encouraging innovation. I am concerned that the European Commission decided to transfer the funding of GMES outside the multiannual financial framework, and I do not agree with this step. I am concerned that the GMES programme will lose its European dimension in this way, becoming a mere instrument of individual interests. In its communication on the European programme for Earth monitoring and the programme’s operational activities starting in 2014, the Commission stated that it was committed to ensuring the success of the GMES programme, and in this context drew up the communication in order to specify appropriate management and long-term funding of the programme from 2014. I really do hope the Commission will stick to its commitment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, during the economic and financial crisis, it has emerged that several individual national deposit guarantee schemes in Europe had problems. In addition to seeing a lowering of depositor confidence, the State and, ultimately, the taxpayer had to bear the consequences of the failure of a bank.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore consider it right to adopt appropriate measures to achieve significantly better protection for depositors which, taking into account the heterogeneity of the various European banking markets, may implement common requirements applicable to all deposit guarantee schemes, primarily the right to be protected up to EUR 100 000 and the short time limit for repayments to depositors where they are due.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted against the report on deposit guarantee schemes. While what the scheme hopes to achieve is clearly desirable for all Member States, it is my view that the measures which have been proposed to reach these aims are neither suitable nor workable in practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a Group, we do not consider it wise to demand that all Member States impose such a high level of pre-funding, especially when our banks are trying to increase capital levels while minimising the withdrawal of credit to consumers. We believe that, rather than imposing a blanket scheme for all Member States, it will be preferable for guarantee schemes and pre-funding levels to be tailored to the needs of the individual Member States, according to their own circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">We feel that the one-size-fits-all proposals that the rapporteur puts forward are actually geared much more towards the banking system of his own country, Germany, than they are towards the EU as a whole. It is this factor, coupled with the insistence on a high level of pre-funding – to be built up over a short period – which led us as a Group, the ECR, to oppose this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the bail-out of the banks will one day be regarded as one of the most scandalous moments of the century. The sums are off the scale. In the United Kingdom, we spent GBP 1 trillion. We know where the money came from. We do not know where it is now; we do not know who has got it. What happened in the panicky days in the intermediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehmans was a total loss of nerve. In their turmoil, politicians the world over turned for advice to the one lot of people who could not give them disinterested counsel, namely bankers. Of course bankers suggested that the banks be bailed out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Do you know what, if we had asked the bakers whether we should bail out the bakeries, I suspect we would have got the same answer, and the bakers might have almost believed it – saying foodstuffs are an absolutely essential commodity, they are not like anything else, and so forth. But that is why we do not ask them; that is why we have representative government.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has now been this explosion of anger, which has taken the form of the occupying movements. I would just say to anyone protesting in those movements: the one thing you are not complaining about is capitalism. In a capitalist system, bad banks would have been allowed to fail; their profitable operations would have been bought by more successful competitors, shareholders and bondholders would have lost, and taxpayers would not have contributed a penny.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this report drawn up by my fellow Welsh colleague, Derek Vaughan, on the guidelines for the 2013 budget, which covers all EU institutions apart from the Commission. He has established in his own-initiative report the need for the EU to freeze these budgets. However, I would urge him and his colleagues on the Committee on Budgets to be bolder in order to seek a real-terms reduction in the overall EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the number of EU Member States implementing harsh austerity measures and unemployment on the rise, standing at 8.9% in my own constituency of Wales, it is only fair that the EU institutions play their part in curbing expenditure. Unnecessary and wasteful excesses need to be identified and reduced and, where possible, eliminated, including addressing the politically taboo issue of a two-seat parliament. Strasbourg and Brussels symbolise the EU excesses which my constituents believe should stop and this question is covered by Amendment 2, which was carried today.

A EUR 50 million investment and EUR 11 million annual operating costs for a House of European History, on top of the EUR 21 million we have already spent on our Parliamentarium, our visitor centre? That is indefensible. Travel expenses of up to EUR 26 000 for each participating Member of Parliament? That is indefensible. A high-end film prize that no one is the slightest bit interested in, but which costs EUR 570 000 annually? That is indefensible. Subsidies for European political parties which will total EUR 30 million this year alone? That is indefensible. I could cite another 100 such examples. That is a scandal.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is nobody from whom to borrow it, so in practice, what we are doing is borrowing it from future generations. In other words, the government is going to inflate away this debt through money printing. It has already happened in the US, it has happened in my country, and it is coming next to the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">Inflation is the coward’s way to close a budget deficit. Unlike a tax rise or a spending cut for which the government is blamed, inflation is still seen by a number of voters as some kind of natural force, something that governments have to deal with, rather than something they create themselves. But in terms of its overall impact, it is far more damaging to the competitiveness and productivity of an economy.</p>

It is because it is factually incorrect. That is because we have only had one seat for many years. The Treaty states: the seat of the European Parliament is in Strasbourg. We could implement all the savings ourselves without having to consult with the Council. We could abolish the mini-part-sessions in Brussels, leading to substantial savings. We could move our administration from Brussels to here, leading to more substantial savings. We could sell our expensive buildings in Brussels and invest much more economically here, leading to yet more substantial savings.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is, however, that no one who supported Amendment 2 wants to do that. This shows that the issue at stake here is not cost cutting.

It is because the right-wing conservative government of Prime Minister Orbán decided to introduce into the constitution a reference to the values that are contrary to the political correctness in force in Europe today: a reference to Christian values, a reference to the institution of matrimony as a union between a woman and a man, and a reference to the principle that human life is protected from the moment of conception.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Hungarian constitution, although contested by the Socialist left, is a real constitutional achievement of the country. It is a document that emphasises the European and Christian values in which Hungarian society is rooted. It strengthens the protection of life and the institution of matrimony and, above, all, it replaces the Fundamental Law that dated from the Communist period. I believe that the doubts raised by the representatives of some EU Member States were largely unjustified, if not to say exaggerated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I voted today in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by my parliamentary group, and against the motion for a resolution proposed by the Left. I believe that in the political and economic situation in which Hungary currently finds itself, we are obliged to offer broad support to the people and authorities of that country. I should like to express my disapproval of any form of challenge to the laws adopted by the Hungarian Parliament in a democratic manner and in compliance with the generally accepted standards of the Western world.</p>

When you switch on the television news in the evening, you will hear someone criticise the government. Nevertheless, claims are made that there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression. This is quite absurd. Hungarian television broadcast the debate in this House in full.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wish a similar level of freedom of expression existed in all Member States, so that the people could make up their own minds. Following this debate, I received e-mails and letters from hundreds of Hungarians saying they felt the speakers on the Left were referring to a completely different country because they completely ignored the facts. They also told me that they believe that the issue at stake here is no longer the truth, but rather ideological warfare against a free country.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, it seems that there is no reason to expect fundamental changes in the election process in Russia. See-through ballot boxes and cameras in polling stations do not address systematic problems. President Medvedev himself has recognised that the rules need to be changed, but after the Presidential elections. This time, candidates throughout the country each had to collect 2 million signatures within a very short period – over four weeks (two of which were over Christmas). Such requirements constitute a formal basis for restricting voters’ opportunities to choose candidates from a broad political spectrum. Observer status is only granted to representatives of registered candidates and this limits the opportunities for public observation and monitoring of elections. There are worrying reports of barriers faced by several non-governmental organisations, above all, the Golos association.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Once again, I would like to say that today, I voted in favour of amendments concerning the Politkovskaya, Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky cases.

Russia, as a privileged partner of the European Union, must meet certain standards in order to support the confidence in this partnership and make it viable. Unfortunately, what is happening in Moscow and elsewhere – numerous ordinary citizens, as well as organisations that are involved in the protection and defence of human rights are demonstrating in the streets – proves that we are dealing with a totalitarian temptation which is perverted and is unable to serve its citizens, only the interests of some political structures. The fact that some candidates were not allowed to campaign, the way in which the Electoral Commission works, and the fact that the campaign was not conducted fairly serve as proof that Russia is far from complying with these standards.</p>

It is hardly surprising that more and more people in this House, regardless of political divisions, view with growing concern what is happening on our eastern border.</p>

It is not a simple matter for candidates who do not fall in with the authorities to get registered. Added to this is Russia’s position in international politics, which has de-masked the Putin regime somewhat. I have in mind here Russia’s veto of the UN resolution on Syria. The Russian stance on this question shows what they really are – supporters of the ruthless murderers of the Syrian regime.</p>

It is increasingly a movement that is fed up and disgusted with the whole political elite and with the thieves, the oligarchs that have enriched themselves at the expense of Russian workers, Russian pensioners and Russian youth. The movement is a demonstration of massive people-power in action, but the current leadership – a combination of failed neoliberal politicians and right-wing nationalist demagogues – does not offer any way forward in the struggle for democratic rights and freedoms.</p>

Despite that, the situation with regard to democracy in Russia only continues to be a cause for concern. Russia’s electoral practices do not correspond to the norms of the Council of Europe and of the OSCE.

It seems to me that it would be good if by speaking out loudly today – and rightly so – in defence of human rights in Russia, in defence of free elections and in defence of free media, the representatives of many groups in this Parliament were to beat their breasts over their own government, for example, the German Government, as well as others.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, elections are a fundamental pillar of every democratic system. If such a system is to function, elections need to be fair and free. The other parliamentary elections in Russia reflected the distorted reality in which the country currently finds itself. They were neither wholly free, nor wholly fair. They may have shown that citizens are allowed to express their will in elections, but that will is ultimately not respected. The EU must consistently draw Russia's attention to these matters, and it must establish the consequences in terms of further development of relations. I therefore support the resolution we have adopted today and the provisions for the EU to put pressure on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation of all irregularities that accompanied these elections, in order to draw the consequences from this. This appeal is all the more pressing for the fact that Russia is shortly facing further elections.</p>

I agree that blind and dyslexic people should be enabled as far as possible to read books and printed matter in formats accessible to them, and also to lawfully distribute such materials across borders. In my opinion, this is one of the ways in which we can extend the hitherto very restricted access of the visually impaired to publications. I therefore support a targeted exception to copyright, which should be part of an international treaty drawn up at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). I hope this resolution contributes towards the Commission and the Council supporting a WIPO treaty on copyright on books and printed materials for blind and visually impaired people.</p>

I fully believe that easy access to books is a great opportunity that should be shared by everybody. The world of literature should not only be accessible to those who are sighted, nor should it only be sighted people who can access encyclopaedias, comic books, recipe books, dictionaries, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our group does not object in any way with the general aim of this report. The aspect of the report that forced us to abstain as a group was the demand for a binding treaty on the issue, which seems a little extraordinary. As noted in the resolution, EU negotiators have already opposed the adoption of a binding treaty. We do not believe that, in this instance, a binding treaty would be the best way forward. It should be a voluntary convention of some sort instead.</p>

It is therefore essential that people trust and believe in the credibility of financial institutions: if not, withdrawals by depositors could jeopardise the financial stability of these institutions.

      <p sl="ro">The current economic and financial crisis has affected not only the political and institutional mechanisms of Member States, but also the ordinary citizens. As the closure of several banks has fully demonstrated, the stability of deposit and credit systems is essential to the success of the European economy. Member States’ citizens had to be compensated practically from public funds because of the failure of banking institutions responsible for managing their deposits. In these circumstances, the establishment of a European deposit guarantee scheme contributes significantly to the effective and real time protection of the European citizens’ savings. A further concrete advantage of the proposal is the establishment of protection measures enabling the prevention of banking institution failures, warning the national and European authorities in real terms about the existing systemic risks. I support the adoption of this measure by the European Parliament, which complements the directive adopted previously by the Council and the European Parliament on the increase of the deposit ceiling guaranteed by public authorities and on reducing the time for compensating the depositors. At the same time, I believe that by adopting this proposal, a decisive step is made towards achieving a genuine single market in banking services.</p>

It is especially welcome that the directive clearly determines the coverage level for the same depositor, and that the incomes resulting from all transactions under this protection are indicated specifically by name, and that the incomes of local governments are also given sufficient coverage.

      <p sl="it">The Simon report provides Parliament with an important legislative document, which affects a number of issues relevant to bank deposits and the bank guarantees on them. The current financial crisis has generated a climate of understandable distrust of banks and financial institutions, to the point that in 2010, the Commission decided to intervene yet again regarding earlier directives on this matter, given the delicate situation that many banks are going through following the financial turmoil. This proposal aims to modify and replace older directives with one introducing uniform standards for bank deposit guarantee and protection. Uniform criteria will be introduced by this directive to establish a minimum degree of confidence in banks on the part of citizens and businesses that is now at an historic low.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because I believe that, as the financial crisis continues, the creation of a single EU-wide deposit guarantee scheme is particularly relevant and necessary. Existing national deposit guarantee schemes in the EU must reimburse depositors in the event of failure of a credit institution up to a certain ceiling. In truth, during the financial and economic crisis, the coverage level was increased to as much as EUR 100 000 per depositor and the time limit for paying depositors was reduced to a maximum of 30 working days. The increased level of protection improves depositors’ confidence and thus helps to prevent simultaneous withdrawals by many depositors prompted by a fear of losing their money. These steps to strengthen the confidence of depositors are very welcome but more can and must be done. That is precisely why we are considering laying down a binding requirement throughout the EU that deposit guarantee schemes in all EU Member States and all credit institutions should comply with common requirements. This would avoid any distortion of competition, protect depositors equally in all Member States and prevent destabilising displacements of deposits.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In 2008, the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the United States, Lehman Brothers, unleashed a tsunami through the financial sector because of fear that its customers would not be repaid what they were owed. With the exacerbation of the global crisis, other banks have collapsed and their depositors have not always recovered their savings. This situation has caused the public to have a certain amount of mistrust in financial institutions, which needs to be won back. This report, drafted by Mr Simon, concerns the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, at first reading, on deposit guarantee schemes. I welcome this proposal for a directive intended to create a fund for guaranteeing deposits, since it cannot be the taxpayer that pays for the banks’ financial problems. On the contrary, the public should have guarantees that, if a bank fails, their deposits will not be under threat and they will be reimbursed within a reasonable timeframe. I voted for this report, since the new regulations will benefit the European public and society through guarantees and harmonisation, thereby contributing to the construction of a single market in financial services at European level.</p>

It also fails to specify which institutions are responsible for financing DGSs.

      <p sl="sk">No bank, regardless of the state of its finances, has sufficient liquidity to pay out all deposits or a significant portion of them on the spot. Banks are therefore exposed to the risk of a mass withdrawal of deposits if savers believe that their deposits are not safe. That can have a serious impact on the entire economy. At present, there are almost 40 deposit guarantee schemes in the EU protecting different groups of savers and deposits at different levels of cover, and imposing different financial obligations on banks, which limits the advantages of the single market both for banks and savers. With the aim of facilitating the start-up and operation of credit institutions, it is necessary to eliminate differences in Member State laws concerning the rules on deposit guarantee schemes that apply to these institutions. The directive in question is a fundamental instrument for the creation of a single market in the area of credit institution activities from the perspective of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide financial services, while increasing the stability of the banking system and protection of savers. It should create equal conditions for credit institutions, enable savers easily to understand the details of the deposit guarantee schemes, and facilitate rapid payment to savers from healthy and reliable deposit guarantee schemes in the interests of financial stability. For this reason, too, it is necessary for deposit guarantees to be harmonised and simplified as much as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This simply means that in the event that a major bank fails, it is unlikely that any guarantee will work without urgently calling on the State yet again, in other words, on the taxpayer. When a bank is ‘too big to fail’, therefore, it can always do whatever it likes. The aim is worthy enough, but, in the event of a disaster, its effectiveness is doubtful.

The rapporteur insists on the need to strike a balance between the uniform protection of depositors in each Member State through the diligent compliance of common requirements as set out by the proposal, and the flexibility which must be afforded to Member States in determining the framework for the operation of deposit guarantee schemes. The proposals for cutting red tape, ensuring adequate funding (both at the ex ante and ex post stages), staving off distortions of competition and ensuring that the same coverage level and target level are adhered to by all Member States are equally welcome.

By means of this approach, effective protection of depositors will be achieved and the stability of the financial system ensured. A higher coverage level is not sufficient to credibly protect depositors. In order to counteract the danger of bank runs and prevent a possible destabilisation of financial markets, deposit guarantee schemes must also be adequately financed. During the financial and economic crisis, however, it has become apparent that individual national deposit guarantee schemes in Europe were inadequately financed, so that the State and, ultimately, the taxpayer had to bear the consequences of the failure of a credit institution. In order for deposit guarantee schemes to have a stabilising effect at times of financial stress, it is therefore also necessary throughout the EU to finance deposit guarantee schemes adequately in advance (ex ante). Depositors must be better informed than has hitherto been the case about how deposit guarantee schemes operate and must be reimbursed rapidly if the occasion arises. Bringing the measures together will increase depositors’ confidence, promote the stability of the European financial system and help to build the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Regardless of the financial situation of a bank, strong or weak, it is impossible for it to have enough cash for the partial or full reimbursement of population credits in the case of massive withdrawals. For this reason, banking establishments are confronted with the ‘bank run’ phenomenon, where depositors believe that their deposits are not safe and try to withdraw them at the same time. National deposit guarantee schemes in the European Union are particularly important for our citizens and offer additional confidence for creating bank deposits. The European guarantee schemes compensate depositors in the event of payment defaults up to a certain coverage level. The ceiling level was raised, first, from EUR 20 000 to EUR 50 000, and, as from 2011, to EUR 100 000 per depositor.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) should be considered from two points of view: the degree to which depositors are protected and to which bodies responsibility for this protection falls. This report supports strengthening the guarantees given to depositors, based on making financial institutions more responsible, so as to furnish DGSs with resources enabling them to tackle crises and prevent this responsibility from falling to the taxpayer through public involvement. This is the fairest option, the most responsible one and the one that sends the institutions themselves the best message about how to conduct their activities. I will vote for this report for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The formulation of common requirements applicable to deposit guarantee schemes will make it possible for Member States to organise these schemes in as flexible a manner as possible while providing uniform protection, ensuring equal stability and avoiding distortions of competition. While maintaining the same coverage level and target level and abiding by the stipulated time limits for reimbursements and terms relating to the use of funds, Member States will thus have the opportunity to adapt their deposit guarantee schemes to national features of financial markets. By means of this approach, effective protection of depositors will be achieved and the stability of the financial system ensured.</p>

      <p sl="it">Banks are special financial intermediaries because they are financed through deposits – instruments that are redeemable on demand and not liable for losses. The longer maturity of bank assets makes the repayment of deposits difficult in the event of an unexpected and simultaneous withdrawal request from depositors. A ‘run on the bank’ could spread to other banks and compromise the stability not only of the banking system but also of the entire economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to prevent this risk, a growing number of countries have introduced a system of deposit guarantees, following the example set by the United States. Deposit insurance has been shown to be effective in preventing bank panic, but it undermines market discipline in respect of management and shareholders and creates moral hazard problems. In fact, it lessens the incentive for depositors to monitor how the bank is being managed; a lack of attention from depositors may encourage the bank to employ riskier methods, given that they will reap any profits whilst any losses will be burdened by the deposit guarantee fund and, if this proves insufficient, by taxpayers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Commission has tabled a proposal on the deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) that are intended to provide the proper mechanisms for ensuring the public that their savings, investments or insurance policies are protected, regardless of where in Europe they may be located. I am voting for this report because I believe there is a need to ensure effective coverage for deposits of up to EUR 100 000 in any currency, whether made by private individuals or businesses. There will also be a need to reduce the associated bureaucracy, speed up payments and go ahead with a wide range of measures enabling responsible and long-term finance for the 95% of deposits that are within the protected limit. I believe that Europeans will not only have better protection for their savings, but will also be able to choose the best savings product in any European country. Banks will already benefit from the scheme, since they will be able to offer competitive products throughout Europe without being limited by these differences. I also consider it crucial that measures intended to prevent future claims against DGSs be adopted, as it is advisable to predict and oversee banking activity regularly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of Parliament’s legislative resolution of 16 February 2012 on the proposal for a directive on deposit guarantee schemes (reform) because this directive constitutes an essential instrument to the achievement of the internal market from the point of view of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide financial services in the field of credit institutions, while increasing the stability of the banking system and the protection of depositors. The national deposit guarantee schemes in the EU cover depositors in case a credit institution fails to honour its obligations up to the deposit guarantee ceiling, which, starting from 1 January 2011, is EUR 100 000 per depositor.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To make sure that the deposit guarantee schemes have a stabilising effect in times of financial crisis, it is necessary to ensure sufficient financing of the deposit guarantee schemes in advance (ex ante) everywhere in Europe. Depositors need to be better informed than they are at present about the way the deposit guarantee schemes operate, and in case a credit institution fails to honour its payment obligations, they should be compensated quickly. The formulation of common requirements applicable to deposit guarantee schemes allows Member States maximum flexibility in setting up these schemes.</p>

All banks, without exception, should be required to belong to a deposit guarantee scheme and adequate ex ante funding is required for all deposit guarantee schemes.

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of this directive on deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) is to lay down common requirements for the Member States to follow on protecting depositors when a credit institution goes bankrupt. In some ways, the rapporteur’s proposal increases the level of protection for depositors: it establishes the legal right to a maximum reimbursement of EUR 100 000 and a shorter time limit for repayment. However, some aspects of this directive are cause for concern. For one thing, this directive is another step towards full implementation of the EU internal market. It leaves the way open for merging the DGSs of various Member States and for creating separate cross-border schemes on a voluntary basis. Another problem is that it fails to specify which institutions are responsible for financing DGSs. It cannot be the state, otherwise known as the taxpayer, that suffers the consequences of credit institutions’ failure when DGSs have not worked well enough. The directive should ensure that this issue is covered.</p>

This is how I could briefly sum up the essence of the ‘yes’ vote I cast for the report on the guidelines for the 2013 budgetary procedure. Through the European Parliament, the European Union has once again demonstrated its amazing ability and skill to implement an enlargement of great strategic importance such as the accession of Croatia in such a way as to not burden the multiannual financial framework adopted earlier. Additionally, I noted with satisfaction the emergence of a marked need to set up a working group for the independent evaluation of the EP budget, as well as those measures that are intended to keep the budget within the bounds of rationality and economy. There is no doubt that the institutional systems of the European Union, including the European Parliament itself, must take the lead in respect of the restrictive economic policy they promote and expect the domestic budgets of the individual Member States to meet.

The Vaughan report quite rightly advocates freezing the European Parliament’s budget for 2013. That is necessary, as we all know, for we must take appropriate action. However, we should not forget that the accession of Croatia runs the risk of increasing EU spending. We will need to be even more proactive than we are currently being, and anticipate budgetary adjustments as an imperative for future spending. As a way of showing solidarity with the citizens of Europe, it is only to be expected that we should freeze spending related to travel and our individual allowances until 2014. Alongside the measures linked to our individual allowances, the report advocates identifying long-term saving opportunities in order to maintain spending within the budgetary limits that we have set ourselves. It is vital to identify overlaps and inefficiencies across budgetary lines. As a result, in solidarity with the difficulties being experienced by many Member States, we are calling, through this report, for an independent evaluation of Parliament’s budget in order to make an objective analysis of the adjustments that need to be made.</p>

I actively support the Single Seat campaign led by a group of MEPs who are committed to finding a solution to this issue. At a time of economic crisis, it is astonishing that the EU continues to spend millions of euro every year maintaining two seats.

Economically speaking, the western stocks are the most important stocks of horse mackerel in Union waters. Biological information on these stocks is insufficient for an overall assessment allowing fish mortality targets to be set for fishing related to the maximum sustainable yield, which could back up the total allowable catch with scientific forecasts in this area.

      <p sl="it">Certain types of fish can be made into meal and oil. However, the target species of industrial fishing are generally those not destined for human consumption, that therefore have a reduced commercial value. These are small-sized species, often sandeels, Norway pout, sprat and blue whiting, but medium-sized species are also caught, such as the Atlantic horse mackerel, which we are discussing today in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="it">Industrial fishing is a fishing operation whose output is used for things other than food for humans. Incidentally, the European Union is concerned about adopting measures that reduce the by-catches of species such as haddock and whiting for human consumption. The most significant stage of production is an industrial process that, after the product has been ground, cooked and pressed, separates solid from liquid matter: the solid matter is crushed and made into meal, whilst the liquid matter is treated so that fish oil can be extracted.</p>
      <p sl="it">Since Atlantic horse mackerel constitutes the main fish stock for this use throughout the European Union, I believe it to be advisable that, for a sustainable exploitation of and the highest long-term yield from the stock, once again in Parliament we look to support a sector that is of strategic importance for many European regions.</p>

I consider it important that CFP reform considers the fact that destructive fishing practices are caused by neighbouring Member States in the regional hydrographic basins of other Member States, which cannot be separated from the problem of regional self-management for hydrographic basins.

Parliament is calling for the consolidation, through this reform, of the sustainable exploitation and preservation of fish stocks, as one of the fundamental ideas of common fisheries policy reform. The European Parliament proposes various measures to achieve this objective, including positive discrimination, i.e. providing that those companies carrying out environmentally friendly fishing should enjoy improved access to the European Funds. Such a practice is already being used successfully in the common agricultural policy. The European Parliament also draws attention to the fact that fisheries is a particularly important sector of EU industry, providing citizens with high-quality food and creating economic and social added value.

      <p sl="pt">Fishing is intrinsically linked to multiple aspects of European life and contributes to making this life richer, more diverse and healthier. In terms of food, which is the aspect most immediately comprehensible by consumers, the existence of this product makes an important contribution to the richness and variety of our diet. However, this is just one aspect of the many economic, environmental, cultural, scientific, recreational and tourism factors that are affected by this activity and that should be borne particularly in mind when setting out and implementing a common fisheries policy for the European Union. Without this cross-cutting and multidisciplinary approach, we will risk intervening in fishing in a way that reduces its impact and potency. As a citizen of the European country with the largest maritime area, I not only do not want that, but also consider it a strategic error. Water is an important source of resources and fishing could be an important source of income for European businesses if this comprehensive and integrationist vision is properly appreciated and applied.

This is one of the reasons why we must make an effort to protect and maintain fish populations. The role of fisheries as a supplier of food for human beings is both long term and widely acknowledged. The fisheries sector, including wild and farmed fish, is an activity that contributes to the production of irreplaceable common goods through the three main strands of fishing, processing and marketing.

The fisheries sector is an important EU industry which provides EU citizens with high-quality food and creates economic and social added value for the European Union. Therefore, the reformed CFP needs to guarantee the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources and the preservation of fish stocks at a healthy level, so that fishing activities can continue in their traditional areas and communities in the long term. Fishing activities, when all their dimensions are considered, including sustainable aquaculture, their direct and indirect impact, and the common goods produced by means of fishing activities, guarantee social and territorial cohesion and promote vocational training and social and economic dynamism, in line with the EU 2020 strategy for promoting inclusive growth. When drawing up its future policy proposals and decisions, the Commission must ensure that the CFP contributes to the implementation of overarching policy aims. The crucial process of CFP reform must recognise the CFP as a source of development in the context of the European Growth Project and it is therefore essential to create the conditions which enable it to develop its full potential.

Exactly one month from now, we will find out whether or not the Hungarian Government is willing to accommodate the Commission’s demands. If they are not, then that will be the right time for the Commission to take measures. Otherwise, it seems to me that the grounds for making a new resolution will no longer exist.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Let us be clear that what is happening today in Hungary is serious for civil liberties and fundamental rights. However, in the current European political debate, everything is mixed up: economic issues and, in particular, the independence of the Hungarian Central Bank are mixed up with the issue of the independence of the judiciary and the problematic points of the new constitution as regards its compliance with the constituent values of the Union. As far as I am concerned, the central bank is not the main focus. Civil liberties and full respect for democracy are much more important. We now need to reflect on the most appropriate way to counter the Hungarian regime’s drift towards authoritarianism. Could that be Article 7, which is mentioned so often? In my view, we instead need to support the democrats in Hungary at all costs, both citizens and politicians, who are committed to democracy and its values. That should be our priority.</p>

It does this without excluding other values and does not seek to wipe its history clean. It is noteworthy that, despite the attacks on issues relating to customs, tradition and Christianity that have been instigated by certain left-wingers, including heirs to and advocates of communism, it is issues related to the separation of powers that have stood out to the Commission.

Parliament cannot intervene in the adoption of the constitution of a Member State, which would be considered interference in a country’s sovereignty and is something that should be judged by the citizens of that country. It is incumbent on the Commission to engage in dialogue with the Hungarian Government in order to overcome any lack of compliance with the EU Treaties. The new Hungarian constitution has been agreed by a majority in the democratically elected Hungarian Parliament and has replaced the communist constitution of 1949.

I therefore welcome the resolution, which calls for it to be established whether the actions of the Hungarian Government conflict with EU law and restrict democratic principles – the separation of powers and the pluralism of political parties – and whether they restrict the freedoms of expression and religion, the right to a fair trial and other rights.</p>

In doing so, it is filling the void left by the other EU institutions, which are unwilling to act.

Opinions on the situation in that country ought to be based on facts and rational arguments, not on premature prejudices and emotions. Of course, the situation in Hungary is not perfect but, in my view, Prime Minister Orbán and his government must be given an opportunity to introduce the reforms that are so very necessary, in compliance with EU legislation, in a country where the reign of the former socialists and liberals has led to destructive consequences, both economically and socially. Unfortunately, this political hysteria is lessening Hungarians’ confidence in the European Parliament and is fostering euroscepticism.

On 19 January 2012, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, came before Parliament to clarify his position, assuring this House that the more controversial laws strengthening political control over several of his country’s institutions would be amended. In a letter sent to the Hungarian Government, the Commission expressed its strong concern, in particular, with regard to the independence of the central bank, the data protection authority and the judiciary. However, many NGOs in the country are accusing the Hungarian authorities of abuses of freedom of expression, religion and sexual orientation. Moreover, the Hungarian Government has adopted several retroactive laws that violate one of the basic principles of EU law. As Hungary is governed by the rule of law and is an EU Member State, I believe that it is vital that laws jeopardising the principles of democracy and freedom be reviewed in conjunction with the Commission.

The European Parliament calls on the Hungarian Government, in the common interest of the Hungarian citizens and the EU, to comply with the recommendations, objections and requests made by the European Commission, the Council of Europe and the Venice Commission regarding the issues previously mentioned and to change the laws accordingly, respecting the EU’s core values and standards.</p>

Moreover, most European countries have, in the name of supposed anti-racism, instituted what are effectively muzzling laws, intended to gag free speech on the topic of the huge problems we are experiencing with immigration and crime. Only recently, France passed a law imposing a new official and unassailable historical ‘truth’, this time about the Armenian genocide.

We, Members of the European Parliament, call on the Russian authorities to uphold fully freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in compliance with the constitution of the Russian Federation, and to introduce a package of legislative proposals aimed at developing a truly democratic political system. Moreover, Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s continuing incarceration raises serious questions about Russia’s commitment to the rule of law, judicial independence and human rights. Observers attending his second trial condemned it as failing to meet acceptable standards of due process and independence. The EU must insist on Russia meeting its obligations under international law with regard to civil, political and human rights.

All this is no doubt due in part to the upcoming Russian presidential elections and the preceding campaign, but the EU must not disregard the facts which indicate a shift towards the endangering of political pluralism and the fairness of the elections, the prospect of resorting to intimidation, the restriction of the freedom to express sexual orientation or sexual identity, and other anti-democratic measures which seriously violate the achievements that have been made and put into practice in the field of human rights so far.

The fact is that there does not seem to be a genuine European interest in Russia, or only an interest in terms of reacting to it or comparing the country to our own standards. Despite the importance of such standards, they should not make us forget the geostrategic importance of the largest country in the world. Russia is at a crossroads between liberal democracy and state capitalism, and has recently shown signs of leaning towards the latter model, as seen in its recent veto in relation to Syria in the United National Security Council. Reports on the freedom and fairness of the electoral process lead us to fear that the next presidential elections may also breach international standards.

The Russian Federation is a full member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and has therefore committed itself to upholding the principles of democracy and human rights. On 12 April 2011, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the cumbersome registration procedures for political parties in Russia, which do not meet the electoral standards set by the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and ruled that the limitations on the registration of political parties and candidates restricts political competition and pluralism in Russia. We must continue to encourage Russia’s leaders to adopt more democratic practices vis-à-vis the opposition parties.</p>

It is unfortunately the case that the broad fundamental freedoms enjoyed in some EU States are not common to all Member States. However, the EU should seek to improve the lot of its own citizens before seeking to interfere in other countries. The fact is that the principle of freedom of expression is only partially honoured in some States, or is increasingly restricted as a result of new laws, as in the new catch-all anti-persecution law in Austria, for example.

The resolution rightly states that a strategic partnership between the EU and Russia can only be built on shared common values. For Latvia, as a country neighbouring Russia, it is important for a transition finally to be made in Russia to true democracy, which would not only promote closer economic relations between our two countries but, possibly, would also clear the way to the development of a common understanding about historical events. A democratic Russia is the only opportunity for looking forward to the development of a new foreign policy approach in our neighbour, one that is not based on empire building ambitions and dreams of keeping hold and increasing power and influence in Russia’s neighbouring states. I must, however, express my regret that in the final wording of the resolution, the reference to the need to diversify the supply of energy to the EU, included in the original draft resolution by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, has disappeared. Another point that has disappeared is the call to the EU not to apply double standards in its relations with Russia, such as exemption from some of the conditions included in the third legislative package on energy directed towards ensuring free access to energy supply and distribution networks.</p>

In December 2010, the EU Council signed a document which, after ratification by the European Parliament, made it possible to proceed to the second phase of trade liberalisation with agricultural products and fishery products between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco. In respect of agriculture and fisheries, this new agreement gives mutual precedence to strengthening capital intensive industrial agriculture at the expense of family and small-scale agriculture. Increasing quotas with reduced rates for a broad range of fruit and vegetables will lead to a situation where European producers find it difficult to compete, without even strengthening the balanced development of agriculture in Morocco. We must not forget the EU’s commitments in relation to the Arab Spring regarding assistance for the southern Mediterranean countries in the transition to democracy by means of commercial and business instruments in order to secure a greater level of freedom and more economic opportunities.

Liberalisation of trade between the EU and Morocco can lead to mutual benefits, greater economic growth, prosperity, job creation and the elimination of poverty.</p>

      <p sl="it">The agreement on agricultural liberalisation, as it has been conceived, would have a worrying economic impact on European farmers, above all, within the fruit and vegetable sector, with dramatic repercussions for employment in the rural areas of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, by immediately liberalising 55% of European imports from Morocco, many typical fruit and vegetable producers in Italy would be threatened by the entry on to the European market of products obtained on more competitive terms. We must consider that Moroccan farmers not only have production and labour costs which are far lower than those borne in the EU, but they are also not even required to respect the same production standards regarding the environment and food safety. It would therefore be appropriate, first and foremost, to carry out an impact study on the possible economic and social consequences of this liberalisation before it is applied.</p>

      <p sl="it">Within a context that is already particularly difficult in economic and social terms for the European agricultural sector, a liberalisation agreement conceived in this way would have a catastrophic impact on European farmers, in particular, in the sensitive fruit and vegetable sector, with dramatic repercussions on employment in the rural areas of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Were this agreement to be concluded, there would be a considerable increase in products originating from Morocco, with the introduction of import quotas much higher than under the previous agreement, specifically for six products: tomatoes, courgettes, cucumbers, garlic, citrus fruits and strawberries.

Providing for lower customs duties for Moroccan goods and expanding the quotas of products that can access the European market is equivalent to inflicting a hard blow against our agricultural sector, causing both direct and indirect harm to economies, primarily in the Mediterranean countries of Europe. Increasing numbers of products will enter Europe originating from Morocco, where they are produced and cultivated at very low costs without any respect for social standards and often using child labour. Products will enter our markets which do not respect the same quality and safety standards for consumers that European producers are required to respect.

The rapporteur, José Bové, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are fundamentally opposed to its adoption. In view of the events in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria, it should be emphasised that the agreements on liberalisation introduced so far have failed to achieve the stated objectives, and we cannot therefore continue with a policy which favours the economic interests of powerful entities without assessing the social impacts on the population and the damage caused to the environment and the climate. The report has particularly drastic negative consequences for European and North African agriculture and fishing because it strengthens industrial agriculture at the expense of sustainable agriculture. It confronts European producers with unfair competition in the form of dumping based on child labour and jobs with no social standards whatsoever. For North Africa, the submitted report is harmful for the environment in particular. Powerful agricultural interests draw underground freshwater for their own agricultural profit in such a way that its surface is falling by 1.5 metres a year on average. For example, in Morocco, it takes 100 litres of water to grow one kilogramme of tomatoes, compared to 10 litres of water in France or Germany.

Firstly, it will harm European producers, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises of typically Mediterranean crops, particularly in the area of fruit and vegetables, since this agreement increases the pressure being felt today from low base prices and the difficulties experienced by many producers in distributing their products. Portuguese farmers will be hit particularly hard by this. Secondly, family farming will be another loser, as it is starting to face competition from intensive production and export-oriented models. Such models threaten environmental sustainability, the viability of regional and local markets, and food sovereignty, while also reducing food quality and safety. For these reasons, consumers and populations also lose out. Those who benefit most are large European companies and multinational distributors, who will thus be able to win new markets and access cheap labour, as well as have a better chance of circumventing social, employment and environmental standards in force in European countries. Finally, we cannot accept that the Commission is still ignoring the issue of Western Sahara, which is being illegally occupied by Morocco, with a total lack of respect for international law.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted against this agreement as I consider it inadequate and, above all, detrimental to Italian agriculture, particularly to the fruit and vegetable sector. Unfortunately, the logic of national interests has prevailed which, as has already happened in other sectors, benefits major industries from northern Europe to the detriment of those from the south, including, in particular, the Mediterranean area. This House has not followed the indications provided in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which had voted against ratification of the agreement. Considering also the crisis and the indiscriminate increases in the cost of fuel in Italy, which has a significant impact on the price of agricultural foodstuffs, we risk setting off a war among the poor. Moreover, the quality and safety aspect of the imported products is not to be overlooked, since the guarantees which will be provided are not sufficient in my opinion.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The association agreement between the EU and Morocco entered into effect in 2000. In December 2010, the EU Council signed a document which, after ratification by the European Parliament, made it possible to proceed to the second phase of trade liberalisation with agricultural products and fishery products between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco. In respect of agriculture and fisheries, this new agreement gives mutual precedence to strengthening capital intensive industrial agriculture at the expense of family and small-scale agriculture. Increasing quotas with reduced rates for a broad range of fruit and vegetables will lead to a situation where European producers find it difficult to compete, without even strengthening the balanced development of agriculture in Morocco. We must not forget the EU’s commitments in relation to the Arab Spring regarding assistance for the southern Mediterranean countries in the transition to democracy by means of commercial and business instruments in order to secure a greater level of freedom and more economic opportunities. In this context, the agreement in question looks like a positive step, leading to support for political stabilisation and mutual, sustainable economic development. Liberalisation of trade between the EU and Morocco can lead to mutual benefits, greater economic growth, prosperity, job creation and the elimination of poverty.</p>

      <p sl="it">The agreement on agricultural liberalisation, as it has been conceived, would have a worrying economic impact on European farmers, above all, within the fruit and vegetable sector, with dramatic repercussions for employment in the rural areas of the European Union. For example, by immediately liberalising 55% of European imports from Morocco, many typical fruit and vegetable producers in Italy would be threatened by the entry on to the European market of products obtained on more competitive terms. We must consider that Moroccan farmers not only have production and labour costs which are far lower than those borne in the EU, but they are also not even required to respect the same production standards regarding the environment and food safety.</p>
      <p sl="it">It would therefore be appropriate, first and foremost, to carry out an impact study on the possible economic and social consequences of this liberalisation before it is applied. I therefore hope that there is a desire to review the proposed agreement to safeguard the principle of reciprocity and the possibility for our farmers to compete within a competitive context which, if not equal, is at least sustainable.</p>

I would like to reassure them that there are guarantees. Given the sensitive nature of this sector and the offensive capability of Morocco, mechanisms for preserving this area have been implemented. In particular, this involves maintaining quotas for the most sensitive products (tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, clementines and so on) which will be subject to monthly management, maintaining entry prices for fruit and vegetables, and a safeguard clause. Specific provisions have also been provided for tomatoes, which are in a very challenging position. The liberalisation that Morocco has agreed to will also contribute to strengthening the position of European exporters on the Moroccan market with an immediate and almost total liberalisation of certain sectors. Finally, this agreement enshrines a commitment made in 2008 when Morocco obtained ‘advanced status’. It demonstrates the EU’s wish to support the process of democratisation and reforms being conducted in the country and, eventually, to achieve a common economic space.</p>

The circumventing of the system for import entry prices is considered by a large number of producer organisations to be a matter of deep concern for the sector, particularly with regard to fresh tomatoes. Operators profit from problems with the system, making improper use of current provisions on the customs valuation to cut the import duties due on fruit and vegetables. FEPEX (the Spanish Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Producers and Exporters) has even filed a complaint with Parliament’s Committee on Petitions regarding this very problem. Before opening up the markets any further to additional quotas, there must be effective tariff protection and verification of imported values. Turning to the environment, the outlook here is also negative and calls into question the European Union’s principle of protecting the environment and minimising likely climate change. So far, the social, environmental and economic impacts of this agreement have not always been assessed by the Commission, which has concentrated on tariff matters. An in-depth study is required to allow Parliament to reach a decision in full knowledge of the facts.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I believe the agreement on liberalising agricultural products and fishery products is key to European Union-Morocco relations, particularly given the European Union’s clear strategy of supporting the process of democratisation occurring in some Arab countries. This agreement provides for the progressive implementation of much greater liberalisation of trade in agricultural products and fishery products. I would like to reassure French farmers that this agreement retains mechanisms for protecting the most vulnerable European and French industries, particularly the fruit and vegetable industry. Indeed, the entry price system for fruit and vegetables (particularly for fresh tomatoes) is preserved, which represents a definitive guarantee for French and European producers. This is why I have voted in favour of approval of this agreement by Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I voted in favour of approving the agreement because I am of the opinion that through this agreement, the EU could contribute to the facilitation of economic reforms in Morocco and the establishment of a more advanced system of trade in the region. Naturally, the agreement would also have benefits for the EU, as, in addition to significantly increasing our exports, it would also open up the markets of the Community to the countries of the Arab Spring. Our goal is to become a key actor in the region. This agreement could open up a doorway to Mediterranean markets.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU has a certain responsibility to use its trade and economic capabilities to aid the transition of these countries towards democratisation. I believe that trade liberalisation and progressive integration into the EU’s internal market will help to alleviate the widespread poverty and unemployment in the region, trade and investment being proven engines for growth. It is our hope that such an agreement would also help to bring people together and to secure ties between nations. It is worth pointing out that whereas only 5% of EU citizens are employed in agriculture, 38% of the Moroccan workforce is employed by the sector. This agreement does not just bring benefits to Morocco, but also creates significant advantages for the EU. It will provide significant opportunities for the EU’s agricultural industry, particularly in processed foods, and it is estimated that, eventually, up to EUR 100 million will be saved in customs duties once Moroccan import tariffs for 70% of agricultural and fisheries product lines have been removed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given that access to the EU’s internal market is conditional on meeting hygiene and safety standards, and that a strong dispute settlement mechanism has been agreed that would allow the EU to gain redress if Morocco does not respect the terms, I back this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The agreement between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products will mean enormous disadvantages when competing against Moroccan farmers. Under this agreement, Morocco will automatically liberalise its agricultural sector to cover approximately 45% of the imports from the EU, to reach 70% in 10 years. In its turn, the EU will liberalise approximately 55% of its imports from Morocco under the agreement. Although Morocco will open up further in the long term, there are several points which put the EU at a disadvantage. Firstly, I would like to emphasise that we should impose the same phytosanitary measures and take account of the fact that the cost of labour is substantially lower in Morocco than in the EU. These two elements alone make agricultural products originating in the EU much more expensive. Secondly, there is the issue of the region of Western Sahara, which is included in the agreement, while, according to the United Nations, it should not be, as it is a disputed territory. Finally, I would like to stress that this agreement will bring benefits only for large-scale farms, with no benefit for 90% of Moroccan farmers. I believe that Morocco is engaged in a real process of democratisation. However, I do not agree that agreements should be concluded to the detriment of European agriculture.</p>

This agreement goes against the interests of farmers and small producers on both sides of the Mediterranean and will only benefit big business and the King of Morocco himself, who owns more than 12 000 hectares of land. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) has worked with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and José Bové, who has led the fight over this issue, to put forward an alternative resolution. Our resolution observes that following the Arab Spring, the European Union should no longer dare to dictate unequal relationships, guided solely by the desire to impose its liberal model (the harmfulness of which grows clearer every day) to the detriment of fundamental principles such as food sovereignty. Within this resolution, we also took the opportunity to remark that this agreement should not apply to the Western Sahara. The European Commission responded that ‘the United Nations considers the Western Sahara to be a non-autonomous territory and deems Morocco to be its de facto administrative power’. Such a response is staggering. To apply such reasoning is to declare international law meaningless.</p>

This agreement should not go into effect without fulfilling import control mechanisms as pointed out by OLAF because it does not benefit small farmers in Morocco (over 70% of exports are in the hands of three firms), it includes the disputed Saharan territories (the UN does not recognise the sovereignty of Morocco) and it would mean the progressive disappearance and marginalisation of a number of European agricultural products.</p>

The violent acts against civilians that have been taking place in Syria since March 2011 violate every aspect of humanity. UN estimates indicate that by now, the number of victims has reached 6 000, and this number is growing day by day. With all these horrors, one of the most tragic facts to me is that according to UNICEF reports, there are, at this point, 400 children and young people counted among the victims. It is deeply condemnable that almost 380 additional young people can be confirmed to have fallen victim to arbitrary imprisonment, torture and sexual abuse. These crimes violate all aspects of human rights and children’s rights to the fullest extent and it has therefore become imperative that the European Union takes action in this matter as quickly and as firmly as possible. I find it a positive development in respect of overcoming the situation in Syria that the Arab League has unanimously condemned the events that are taking place in the country, and Europe must therefore continue to act in unison when taking its measures to curb further aggression.</p>

Those responsible for the continuing systematic killing of civilians and massive human rights violations should be brought to justice and held accountable for their deeds.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I consider it significant that the European Parliament is trying to take a unified position on the current situation in Syria. Even though there are bloody conflicts in several locations worldwide, the conflict in Syria is attracting the most attention, not only because of the propaganda campaign but also because it presents the most dangerous threat of escalation. Our stance on the civil war in Syria must be based on the tragic historical experience of our own part of the world, and on the European humanist tradition. It must be based on the need to defend peace and human life. In my opinion, the greatest obstacle to achieving this goal is the unwillingness of certain armed groups to come to the negotiating table. This unwillingness stems from a conviction of inevitable victory over the government by means of violence, as a result of the expected support of NATO. It is highly likely that someone from abroad is supporting these armed groups in their rejection of negotiation. This fact is also reflected in the arming of, and media support for, the uprising. I am not coming forward in any way as a defender of the current regime in Damascus. I simply have a firm belief that, even after the events in Libya, the only path to peace is through compromise and reform. I consider the attempts at violent regime change from abroad in selected states as wholly unacceptable. I would like to make the elementary point that the UN Charter is based on the principle of sovereignty of individual states. Any other approach will only increase chaos in an already unstable world.</p>

Since March 2011, which is to say, the start of the violent repression of peaceful demonstrators, systematic killings and acts of violence have dramatically intensified, and the army and the Syrian security forces continue to respond with targeted killings, torture and mass arrests. According to United Nations estimates, more than 5 000 people have lost their lives. It is necessary to carry out prompt, independent and transparent investigations into these widespread violations in order to ensure that all of those responsible for these acts are held to account by the international community.</p>

In such situations, it is always preferable to find a political solution to the situation: therefore, the veto exercised on 4 February by Russia and China in relation to the draft resolution of the United Nations Security Council, which was moving in the right direction with the necessary cooperation of the Arab League, must be condemned.

I do not believe this position gives credits in internal politics; the citizens of Russia must be wondering whether tolerance to the deeds of the al-Assad regime means such measures against opposition are also an option internally. The EU must utilise its dialogues with both China and Russia to persuade them to stand on the side of universal values (especially since the EU-Russia strategic and extensive partnership is declared to be built upon common values).

The situation in Syria, however, is not as straightforward as it may seem, and it is closely linked with the events unfolding throughout the region. This is not just another part of the Arab revolution; it is also a struggle for influence between the West and the Russo-Iranian tandem. Without the consent of those states, therefore, President Assad cannot be removed from power. The most recent meeting of the UN Security Council was a prime example. We should also remember that the situation in Syria is not as unambiguous as some sources report. The President still enjoys considerable support, in particular, in large cities, and the Alawites and the Christian community which support him represent over 30% of society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For all these years, the authorities in Damascus have eased religious conflicts, inter alia by banning the Muslim Brotherhood. Today, in districts of Homs and Idlib which have been abandoned by the army, there are ongoing clashes between the Alawites and the Sunnis. We thus have to assume that after the fall of Assad, there will be an escalation in sectarian strife. There is no close tie between the Syrian National Council residing in Istanbul and the demonstrators dying in the streets of Homs. Nevertheless, the European Union should strongly condemn the killing of unarmed civilians, including children, who account for over 10% of the victims of this conflict. We should put pressure on Assad to organise humanitarian corridors and allow the civilian population to leave the besieged cities, which would greatly reduce the losses caused by the fighting.</p>

In the field of human rights, the adoption of binding standards is key to rapid progress and concrete improvement on the ground.

Yet, at present, over 95% of published books are not available in accessible formats for visually impaired and print-disabled persons in Europe. In the rest of the world, over 99% of reading material is unavailable for tens of millions visually disabled persons. Despite the vast improvements in print technology in recent years, little progress has been made towards increasing access to books for the visually impaired. A major obstacle to this is the rigid copyright laws that apply to so many titles. Therefore, I would wholeheartedly support an international Treaty at the World Intellectual Property Organisation to establish an international exception and limitation to copyright to facilitate the cross-border movement of reading material formatted for the blind and visually impaired.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This motion for a resolution was tabled pursuant to Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure, further to a question for oral answer by Mr Pescod, on behalf of the European Blind Union/Royal National Institute of Blind People, on access by blind people to books and other printed products, which is only 5% in the European Union. The reason for such a low rate is considered to be that copyright means there are no international legal standards allowing cross-border distribution. The Copyright Committee of the World Intellectual Property Organisation is working on an international treaty to solve this problem. Lack of access for these citizens constitutes marginalisation and negative discrimination that prevents them from accessing the culture to which they are entitled. I am voting for this resolution, since I welcome the measures proposed therein because I think it is crucial that they contribute to improving the quality of life of blind or visually impaired people, thereby preventing their marginalisation and facilitating access to cultural goods, whilst respecting international treaties and realising the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This resolution advocates access to books and other printed products for blind and visually impaired people through copyright policy. Clearly, we voted in favour. We consider it crucial to put a stop to the social injustices and the increase in specific forms of discrimination to which these people are often subjected. We advocate guaranteeing their equal participation in economic, social, cultural and sporting life. However, it will only be possible to guarantee these rights if they are enshrined in an integrated way. The policies currently being implemented by the European Union – and backed by the majority in Parliament – jeopardise the most basic rights of various sectors of the population, including disabled people. If we want to defend disabled people’s rights, we must defend them in all areas of their lives, obviously, without forgetting, for example, that so-called austerity programmes are serving as a cover for pay cuts and for the closure of essential public services for these people, as is happening in Portugal, Greece and other countries, so threatening access to crucial public services, such as health, education and transport.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Blind and visually impaired people in the European Union have severely restricted access to books and other printed products, because 95% of all published works are never converted to ‘accessible formats’ such as Braille, large print or audio. It is regrettable that globally, there is no international legal standard at present for a targeted exception to copyright rules in respect of cross-border distribution of formats adapted for print-disabled persons. This is one of the reasons why the Copyright Committee of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is considering an international treaty to improve access to books for blind and other visually impaired people. In its report of 13 April 2011 on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries, the European Parliament called on the EU to back a binding WIPO treaty, and also called on the Council and Commission to support a binding WIPO treaty with regard to copyright on books and printed products for blind and visually impaired people. It is both necessary and important to support this treaty, since the principles that prevent discrimination against persons with disabilities have also been enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (in particular, Articles 21 and 30) and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

The World Health Organisation (WHO) evaluated the surveys carried out in these countries. These figures indicated that the number of those suffering visual impairment in these countries has risen by 80%. It is assumed that the figures for the remaining EU Member States will be in line with this trend. The reason given for this is the ageing population.

      <p sl="lt">Currently, in the European Union, the blind and partially sighted only have access to 5% of books and other printed matter (Braille, large print or audio). Due to the inflexible rules on the protection of intellectual property rights, people with such a disability have somewhat limited access to culture, education and an active public life. The publication of books for readers with specific needs basically depends on the goodwill of the copyright holder. In Lithuania alone, there are about 7 000 people with severe visual impairment. The goal of the European disability strategy 2010-2020 is for people with disabilities to be able to participate in all areas of daily life throughout the EU, and for an inclusive and high-quality education policy to be developed. It is essential, therefore, to remedy the situation and to ensure that we provide for appropriate relaxations in the requirements regarding intellectual property rights and exceptions that would not only facilitate, but encourage the publishing of books for people who are blind, visually impaired and dyslexic. I believe that the EU, which has set itself some ambitious goals in the strategy, should not satisfy itself with merely recommendatory decisions, but should go that extra step and ensure the adoption of an agreement within the framework of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which is binding throughout the EU and beyond its borders.

They represent one of the most socially isolated groups in Lithuania and Europe. There are at least 150 000 deafblind people in the EU. The exact number of such people in Lithuania is not known because this disability is not officially recognised in my country. Likewise, there is no programme to give deafblind people the best possible assistance. In addition, there is no training for professional people to assess the needs of deafblind people, or for interpreters to help them. Deafblind people in Lithuania do not have the right to the assistance they need for work, or to receive daily specialist social care. It is important for deafblindness to be recognised as a separate form of disability because services that are adapted for people who are deaf or blind are not suitable for deafblind people.

Most books are never converted into a format accessible to the blind, mainly for reasons relating to copyright.

The European Union has always sought to encourage trade integration on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, since international trade could foster economic growth and reduce poverty. Following the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, this integration is even more important and is an essential factor in consolidating the emerging democracies in these countries. It will also enable a series of around 100 trade agreements to be brought together and will facilitate North-South trade. It will also prevent imports originating from the Israeli settlements occupying Palestinian territory, which cannot benefit from preferential rules.

      <p sl="sk">In the spirit of the Barcelona Process, this agreement is speeding up the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area. The first step towards achieving this target was the association agreements between the EU and its Mediterranean partners. The new agreement on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin unites the different rules on the origin of goods that are traded within the framework of the relevant trade agreements concluded between the following states: the EU and the countries participating in the Barcelona Process (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority), the EFTA countries (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein), the Faroe Islands and the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Kosovo, under UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99). The adoption of a single simplified instrument will facilitate a pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin. Last but not least, I believe it is also worth mentioning that following this significant step, other ambitious plans for enhancing and promoting trade in the region should follow, beginning, as soon as possible, with the updating of pan-Euro-Mediterranean rules of origin.</p>

It therefore calls on the Commission to draw up a blacklist of companies which persist in employing these practices and to inform the Member States. It also recalls that in its judgment in the Brita GmbH v Hauptzollamt Hamburg-Hafen case, the European Court of Justice confirmed that the customs authorities of importing Member States must refuse preferential treatment under the EU-Israel association agreement to products exported to the EU which originate from Israeli-occupied territories and for which the Israeli authorities fail to provide sufficient information to enable their real origin to be determined.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The adoption of the regional convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin is an important stage in the efficient continuation of the process started in Barcelona. It is an intermediate stage in the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area and the final target is the drafting of a single convention that would replace the current network of over one hundred bilateral protocols on rules of origin.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the draft resolution to create an instrument with a key role in reducing the complexity of current trade relations. The strategies for the EU’s southern neighbouring regions must have a macro-regional approach. This will promote cooperation between regions to establish common goals, such as sustainable growth, encouraging investments by creating new jobs, and also strengthening democracy. The development of effective cooperation between the EU and the Mediterranean area requires stimulation of access to funds through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). It is equally important to simplify the procedures of granting assistance to the Mediterranean countries. The borders of the European Union must be flexible, not rigid, especially with regard to economic relations.</p>

After all, this strategy is intended to promote the free movement of goods between the EU and the partner countries. In principle, the ban on duty drawback on diagonal trade must be upheld in the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area, something that is not without its problems in the case of the Palestinian Authority for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. There are frequent disputes in this region relating to the actual country of origin of goods. As the agreement is currently undergoing an overhaul, it would be a positive thing if the EU were to pay closer attention to this problem and sought to add new provisions in relation to the pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin that would efficiently prevent abuses, so that this provision does not run contrary to the EU’s support for the Gaza strip.

By comprehensively monitoring the Earth’s environmental and security status through five areas – namely, land, sea, air, emergency response and security – GMES helps Europe to address proactively any negative environmental and security policy changes. Moreover, since the system’s basic services are available to private persons as well, it can also facilitate innovation at European and Member State level. Since the financing framework for the system is only guaranteed until 2013, after the expiry of this period, not only the financial and intellectual efforts invested in the establishment of the system, but also our common effort to develop one of the branches of European space research would be wasted.

Failure to guarantee adequate or long-term and stable financing would mean even greater costs over time, citizens would not have equal opportunities to receive appropriate information, the programme would be suspended or even halted, and its data provision would cease. This could ultimately mean that the investments made to date have been fruitless, and Europe will lose its independence and technological advancement in this space infrastructure.

This represents a tremendous potential in terms of economic growth and job creation through the development of innovative services and commercial applications in the downstream sector.

GMES is one of the Union’s two flagship space initiatives and plays a key role from a political, strategic and technological viewpoint for monitoring climate change, preventing environmental disasters, managing emergencies and organising mobility and energy trading. The Commission’s decision to exclude GMES from the multiannual financial framework and the proposal to fund it through intergovernmental agreements is therefore somewhat perplexing. Despite the fact that several governments within the Council have already voted in favour of maintaining the programme, we cannot completely rule out the risk that the opposition of some countries may scupper it, wasting all the efforts and investments made up to date. Furthermore, the exclusion of Parliament from the decision-making process and, therefore, the absence of democratic participation, would be very disappointing. I hope that the Commission will reconsider its position and decide to listen to Parliament’s call to reintroduce GMES into the multiannual financial framework.

      <p sl="en">In favour. The EP regrets the fact that on 30 November 2011, the Commission published only a communication and did not come forward with a legislative proposal on GMES, given that the current Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 covers only initial operations and will expire by the end of 2013; it also disagrees with the direction that the Commission indicated in its communication as regards the future financing and government of GMES, the aim being intergovernmental funding of the project; and it is concerned that this direction will be hugely detrimental to the future development of the programme, causing it to lose its European dimension, contradict the principles of transparency and full, open and equal access for all, and be seen as a sign of disengagement by the EU from this flagship initiative.</p>

      <p sl="it">It was with great pleasure that I played a part in the adoption of the text on the future of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme. We have been discussing the funding of this rather controversial programme for some time in the Committee on Budgets. I believe that financing GMES outside of the multiannual financial framework (MFF), as proposed by the Commission in its communication, is not a viable option, as also stated in one of the text’s paragraphs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Although I understand that the GMES programme is an initiative in which the European Union has heavily invested and that it performs a key role in Earth observation, I would merely like to stress the concern that financing GMES may deprive other budget lines of major investments.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Alongside Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme is one of the EU’s flagship initiatives and plays an extremely important role in monitoring space for all areas of society, including agriculture, climate change and natural disaster prevention; it even makes an entire economic activity possible. The services resulting from this programme are of enormous economic, social and technological importance. It is therefore regrettable that the Commission is not tabling a strategic plan that includes funding and upcoming actions, so as to not allow a project of this value to collapse. This motion for a resolution, for which I voted, calls for the creation of an EU-level institutional framework for the GMES post-2013. The proposal for intergovernmental funding could jeopardise its development and implementation. I therefore consider it relevant that the GMES should be included in the multiannual financial framework, since there is a need to demonstrate that this programme and its services are commercially viable.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the future of the European Earth monitoring programme (GMES) because it represents a flagship space initiative of the EU and plays a key role in observing the Earth, making it an essential tool in combating climate change and environmental degradation, for civil protection and security, sustainable development, and mobility and crisis management. GMES offers significant economic opportunities by stimulating innovation and job creation across the whole of the EU. GMES was established as an EU programme, financed through the EU budget with approximately EUR 3.2 billion by 2013, under the management and responsibility of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We believe that the Commission’s current proposal to finance GMES outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) is not a viable solution because the uncertainty relating to GMES financing seriously affects the development and marketing of services and applications related to this programme, which is expected to generate economic growth and welfare for European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this regard, we urge the Commission to table a legislative proposal for the management, financing and long term operation of the GMES programme, financed under the MFF, in order to ensure proper implementation of the programme and to achieve its objective of being fully functional as of 2014.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, we have spoken many times already in this Chamber about the political situation in Belarus and we have adopted critical resolutions on the matter of that country’s respect for human rights. Today, however, we have decided to focus on a particularly tragic aspect of the Belarusian reality – the handing down and implementation of the death penalty in the country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Recently – in November last year – two men alleged to be responsible for the bombings on the Minsk metro were sentenced to death. It is not in our power to decide the guilt or innocence of the two convicts, but we are of the same opinion regarding many very serious questions in respect of the fairness of the trial. We therefore urge the authorities to refrain from implementing this penalty, in particular, in the case of these two men – Konovalov and Kovalev – but also to introduce a general moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, since the latter is brutal and irreversible. We also call on the Belarusian authorities to stop further repression of human rights defenders and democracy activists and to engage in dialogue with the European Union, under the condition that they release all political prisoners.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as has already been said in this Chamber, it is indeed the case that we do not decide whether people are guilty; however, we know that there were many irregularities during the investigation into the attack on the subway, that some of the confessions were extracted under torture, and that much of what should form part of a normal trial was lacking in this case. Therefore it is not our role to issue judgments on guilt or innocence, and it is not our role to issue judgments on whether the death penalty is good or bad. What we are voting on, and what our position consists of, is opposition to these specific incidences, because the handing down and implementation of the death penalty in non-democratic countries and dictatorships must always be opposed, as we can be sure that the death penalty there is an element of political pressure and of political struggle, and we should always be opposed to this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, last year, the European Parliament adopted four resolutions on the topic of human rights violations in Belarus and the persecution of opposition activities, representatives of independent media and human rights defenders.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, the subject of our debate is the trial of Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev, found guilty of participating in terrorist attacks in Vitebsk in 2005 and in Minsk in 2008 and 2010. There are many reasons for questioning proceedings during the trial in which they were both sentenced to death. Human rights organisations have regularly informed the public both of procedural irregularities and of the suspected use of torture to compel the men to admit their guilt.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Belarus is the only country in Europe which still implements the death penalty. Our previous demands for the cessation of its use addressed to the Belarusian Government have so far remained unanswered. I therefore appeal again, this time in defence of the two prisoners, to refrain from implementing this sentence, since there are so many doubts surrounding their guilt, and since the announced verdict may deprive two innocent persons of their lives. The European Union should react strongly in such cases, using both specific diplomatic instruments and sanctions against officials or firms responsible for directly financing this regime.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, while the use of the death penalty is on the decline worldwide, the government of Belarus is the only European government to retain this practice. We need to make it absolutely clear to President Lukashenko, who likes to emphasise his country’s European credentials, that state-sponsored murder is not compatible with European values.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since Belarus gained its independence, at least 400 people have died under the death sentence; at least four people have been executed in the last two years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under Belarusian criminal law, the timing of the execution is not made public, even to family members. The body of the executed person is not handed over to the bereaved for burial and the burial location is also kept secret.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same fate now awaits Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev, despite the fact that the judgments have been handed down in an unfair process. The rule of law has not been upheld. There are many reasons to believe that Mr Konovalov’s confession was obtained under torture. The penalty may be carried out at any moment and the international community therefore urgently needs to increase pressure on the government in Minsk.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this resolution, we are calling for the sentence to be commuted immediately and for an initial moratorium on the death penalty, followed by its complete abolition.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, every one of us knows the value of human life, and, as a doctor, I would venture to say that I know this particularly well.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We are debating a resolution on the death penalty against Dmitri Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev, and we are linking this to the general issue of abolishing the death penalty in Belarus. What facts do we have? The death penalty is enshrined in the law of Belarus as an exceptional measure for the worst crimes. We all know that Belarus has repeatedly, despite support for the death penalty from citizens in a referendum, declared a moratorium on this ultimate penalty. Both of the accused and condemned men were given an opportunity to appeal to the country’s President, in accordance with laws that do not differ in any way from the legal systems in so-called democratic states. One man appealed, the other did not. The terrorist act in the Minsk metro was investigated not only by the Belarus special services, but also by Interpol specialists from the United Kingdom, and specialists from Russia and Israel. The fact that a terrorist act was committed and 15 people died is no less a fact than the terrorist act of 11 September 2001.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Due to the doubts we have over the process, we want to see these human lives spared. We must strongly urge the Belarus authorities to examine the evidence once again, and particularly the trial process. It would be a major success if we could bring about the abolition of the death penalty and the laws that allow it, including the possibility of this happening in the US or Japan. It is my firm belief that we must, as a matter of conscience, push for a moratorium at least, and preferably for the abolition of the death penalty in Belarus, without pressure.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I very much concur with all those members who have urged the Belarusian regime to waive the death penalty for those two young men, Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev. Belarus is the only remaining country in Europe to continue to apply the death penalty, and, indeed, this will be the 400th time it has done so since the 1990s. Mind you, that is not the only stain on this country. Each week, I receive from concerned NGOs the names of Belarusian citizens who have been arrested and locked up for alleged opposition activities. The number of people ending up in prison is ever increasing and that is on top of all those participants in the December 2010 demonstrations who remain in custody.</p>

We universally condemn this appalling act of terrorism. I call on the Belarusian authorities to finally listen to the united voice of the European Parliament and other institutions, to reinvestigate the terrorist act, and only then to try the real perpetrators. We demand that the death sentence passed on Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev be rescinded, because even the victims of this crime do not trust the evidence or the fairness of the trial. The death sentence is opposed by more than half of Belarusian society.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This case is yet more proof that justice in Belarus has become an object of manipulation. If the authorities execute the alleged terrorists, suspicions will grow that they are concealing the real criminals. It is high time that Minsk heard the calls from Brussels.

It will be a real blow and I think the European Parliament should bring sustained and very strong pressure to bear on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is good that we are talking about Belarus again. It has been perhaps the most discussed topic over the last eight years in this Chamber. I think we have to state quite clearly that use of the death penalty as an instrument not just of penal policy, but of policy as such, is absolutely unacceptable. Wherever the death penalty is proposed, we should protest against it, whether in Belarus or in any other country.</p>

However strongly we may condemn the attack, the fact remains that the death penalty is not an appropriate response to murder and criminality. At least Europe and the Western world – in which I would also include the United States – should differentiate themselves from Asian and African traditions.

I know that there are serious doubts as to the fairness of the trial. I know that the death penalty is cruel, inhuman and irreversible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of Belarus, the punishment does not end even after the implementation of the sentence. Article 175 of the Criminal Code of Belarus provides that the body of the executed person is not issued to the family, nor is any information provided concerning the location of the burial site. We do not know how many sentences are implemented or on what dates. The implementation of the death penalty is covered by state secrecy in Belarus. In this particular case, the only solution would be to pardon the two convicts. We therefore call on President Lukashenko to exercise his right to pardon. Even a bad man can do something good. The President of Belarus is facing such an opportunity. I hope he will take advantage of it.</p>

At the same time, the prisons in Belarus are crammed with political prisoners, who have been convicted on fabricated charges and who serve their sentences in harsh conditions. The death penalty, however it is carried out, is always inhumane. In Belarus, it is carried out by a pistol shot to the neck.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission should consider tightening targeted sanctions against those who support the Belarusian regime.

      <p sl="en">I call on President Lukashenko to pardon both men and I call on Belarus to establish a moratorium on all death sentences and executions and eventually to abolish the death penalty in that country.

It is unacceptable and unsafe that this country still applies the death penalty, which can be used in a targeted fashion.

The sentencing to death of Dmitri Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev is accompanied by many doubts related to suspicions of torture and inhumane treatment.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the arbitrary nature of the Minsk court’s judgment against the alleged terrorists – Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev – has provoked a strong reaction in Europe. Misgivings are raised by the very credibility of the evidence presented by the prosecution, as well as the fact that the trial has been held behind closed doors. Even the motives behind the attacks are unclear. This begs the question whether the persons convicted are actually guilty. Appeals for clemency remain unanswered by the Belarusian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Terrorist attacks always deserve strong condemnation. This also applies to the acts of terror committed last year in a Minsk metro station. Each such case should be absolutely clear, however, so that the perpetrators are punished and the victims are compensated. I therefore call on the Belarusian authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and – based on hard evidence – a fair trial in accordance with the standards in force in the world today. A death penalty implemented by shooting is highly controversial and cannot fail to bring to mind the most brutal period in the history of the countries of Eastern Europe, the Stalin era. A dialogue with the Belarusian authorities is possible only on the basis of respect by the country for the rule of law, international obligations, human rights and democracy.</p>

In Belarus, it is the activities of the opposition that could incite considerable changes. The task of European countries is to assist the opposition and to not let it lose hope. At the same time, we must admit that Russia has a far greater influence on the current Minsk government than the EU, and we must therefore take steps to bring President Lukashenko and his most important ally, too, to pronounce that the state of affairs in Belarus is unacceptable and unworthy of 21st century Europe.</p>

Since the Soviet Union ended in 1991, up to 400 people have been executed in this way but, significantly, only 50 or less of these were in the last ten years. That would perhaps indicate a change in attitude, and that is something we would welcome. Obviously, we would like to see capital punishment being eliminated altogether as a form of sentence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where these two gentlemen are concerned, if they were truly guilty of the crime of bombing and killing 15 people, it would be hard to argue, emotionally at least, that their sentence should be commuted, but all the evidence is that they were forced to confess.

      <p sl="fr">I would like to say, on behalf of the High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Baroness Ashton, that we are also deeply concerned by these two sentences. Mr Konovalov and Mr Kovalev were sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Belarus on 30 November for their alleged involvement in the Minsk metro attack of March 2011, which left 15 dead and more than 200 injured, as well as attacks committed in Vitebsk in 2005 and Minsk in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While strongly condemning all acts of terrorism, along with the High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Baroness Ashton, we also deplore this double death sentence. Baroness Ashton expressed this extremely clearly and firmly in a statement issued on 1 December 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union opposes all use of the death penalty in all cases and under all circumstances, regardless of the crimes allegedly committed. The European Union considers the death penalty a cruel and inhumane punishment. The death penalty does not deter criminal behaviour and represents an affront to human dignity and integrity that we consider altogether unacceptable. We are thus committed to working for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty, just as we chose to abolish it within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Along with Baroness Ashton, we are urging the Belarusian authorities not to proceed with the executions of Mr Konovalov and Mr Kovalev and to commute their death sentences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also call on Belarus – which remains, as you pointed out, the only country on the European continent still to practise capital punishment – to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty, as you requested. This would be an initial step towards its abolition.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the issue of enforcement of absolutely basic – and this should be underlined – absolutely basic human rights in Belarus is no longer only a concern. It is quite frankly alarming. We are talking here about such elementary issues as the right to life. A situation where the state apparatus freely decides on the life and death of its citizens is absolutely unthinkable, and any such situation should be condemned. Belarus remains the last country in Europe where the death penalty forms part of the legal system and is implemented. It is also a country whose government uses the judiciary to attack the independent opposition within the country. The most recent example is the sentencing to death of two men – Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev – who were convicted of the terrorist attacks in Vitebsk and Minsk in 2005, 2008 and 2011. This judgment was delivered even though no credible evidence was provided to show that the convicted men had committed the criminal offences of which they were accused. The men were denied legal assistance from lawyers. It should be stressed most emphatically that no circumstances can justify any failure to respect human beings and their dignity. At this point I urge the President of Belarus, Mr Alexander Lukashenko, to pardon and release Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev. I appeal also to the entire international community to call on the Belarusian authorities to respect human rights in all instances.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the West and Israel have always been popular targets for Arab potentates. They are by far the most popular red herring manoeuvre used to mask native leaders’ personal failings. In the Egypt of today, these kinds of conspiracy theories are seeing a spectacular comeback. It is now domestic and foreign NGOs that are being labelled as spies and troublemakers.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Allow me to give you two recent examples of that. For the Egyptian Minister for International Cooperation, Faiza Aboul Naga, it is a foregone conclusion that the United States and Israel are at the moment doing everything in their power to undo the ‘people’s’ revolution. The person speaking here seems more like a Minister for International Conspiracy’ than a Minister for International Cooperation. An equally sad example of the official witch-hunt against NGOs is the mobilisation of the media. Consider the action by the pro-government Al-Ahram magazine, which published a complete list of conspirators summoned before the court. In addition, the newspaper allowed angry readers to flood its website with their comments. These anti-Western diatribes surpass even those from the Mubarak era. The conspirators are described as dogs, traitors, who deserve nothing less than public execution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European institutions should take a clear stand against such misleading, pernicious conspiracy theories. This Arab continuity is increasingly threatening to reverse the hopeful Arab Spring into less pleasant political seasons: autumn and winter, at the expense of the future prospects of, in this case, Egyptian society in its entirety. It is not without reason, therefore, that, in the first paragraph of the joint resolution, the European Parliament reassures the Egyptian people of its support for respect for basic rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to add another point to this. This week, I have repeatedly sought contact with and received responses from Cairo and outside Cairo, especially amongst the Christian minority in Egypt. That is not the only minority that is greatly concerned about political developments – the Baha’i community, for example, is, too. What exactly is the Muslim Brotherhood going to do? How much tolerance is there still? If there can be tolerance within the church community, that would be a start, but what about in society as a whole? If we look at what is currently happening under the smoke of Alexandria, namely, that the entire Christian community in a village has had to flee that village because of a show trial, once again involving a man’s word against a woman’s, then I can very much imagine their fear. I hope that the European institutions, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, will respect and defend the fundamental rights of all Egyptians, including those of the Christian minority, in particular.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in November 2011, we were talking here about cases of flagrant violation of human rights in Egypt, starting then with the situation of El Fattah and Sanad bloggers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Recent developments in Egypt, whether concerning attacks on NGOs and foreign political foundations, or the massacre that occurred after the football match in Port Said on 1 February, compels us to intervene again. It is very sad to do so, because we are not talking now about Egypt under Mubarak, but about the country that has just celebrated one year since the revolution.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The PPE Group was, from the very outset, among the supporters of the Egyptian transition, but this support cannot continue if the police brutally repress demonstrations, if the military trials continue, and if the representatives of NGOs and foreign political foundations, including Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, are subjected to criminal prosecution for their actions in support of building democracy in Egypt. The transition to democracy is not possible under intimidation.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Egypt is in the grip of the Arab Winter. The extreme salafists have now become the second largest party in the country and are assuming a dominant, pivotal position. Respect for law has not increased. We all witnessed that in Port Said. Dozens of spectators were killed at that football match and the police just stood by watching.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Arab Spring was brief and has now turned into a winter. There are so many places there where violence prevails and where law is losing its grip: Alexandria, where only last year many Copts were murdered, Cairo, where, in May last year, people were killed in an arson attack on a church, Al Hammadi, which, on the surface, appears peaceful, but where the Copts are oppressed on a daily basis. I call on the Egyptian authorities and the Egyptian Parliament to make use of the support offered by Europe. Allow observers at the upcoming presidential elections. Allow aid organisations that want to work on agricultural projects into the country. Things have to change in that respect in the coming elections.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My call to Baroness Ashton is: make it clear to the Egyptian leaders that Europe is committed to religious freedom and human rights. Europe is offering several hundreds of millions of money in aid. We should not be afraid to use that as a lever.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to extend once again our condolences to the families of those who died in the clashes in Port Said. We insist that a full and transparent investigation take place and all allegations of politically motivated action behind the tragedy be taken seriously. I would also like to express our solidarity and sympathy to all those who continue, day by day, their struggle for democracy and social justice in Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know very well that the transition is not a fairy tale with a happy ending where evil is destroyed and all the characters start a long and happy life. Any transition is a long process with, let us be frank, an open end. It may reach the goals of the revolution or it may end up in chaos or new tyranny. So far, we have seen ups and downs, but the direction was maintained. Worrying signs should not be overlooked. While praising the advances, we should also be vocal on the shortcomings.</p>
      <p sl="en">NGOs are the core of civil society in any country. Egypt has no tradition in that and naturally foreign donors are interested in supporting civil society structures. This is a form of immediate practical support that can be expected and delivered to the country. However, control has been tightened to a degree for which no meaningful explanation can be given. Legal control over foreign funding has tightened; the Central Bank is monitoring bank transfers to NGOs; 10 organisations have been banned and dozens of activists will face trial. Why? We have to react and we call for the criminal charges against NGOs and political foundations to be dropped immediately. I hope that this resolution will be carefully read both in Cairo and in Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in Egypt, the military is the supreme authority and is seeking to keep control of the power that it still has, whilst having already established the compromises of the future through a curious choreography with the ascendant power: the Muslim Brotherhood. Both are using fear of chaos, vandalism and Salafi fundamentalism to establish themselves as the main players, to make Egypt’s situation synonymous with their situation, and to present themselves as the guarantors of order.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us not forget, too, that the army is currently a major beneficiary of the status quo , as it already was in the time of Mubarak. The army controls the majority of the Egyptian economy and has used the transition to control even more, by getting rid of certain competitors within Mubarak’s clique itself. The Emergency Law has not been completely lifted. Accusations of vandalism are being used cynically to arrest bloggers, along with young activists from civil society movements and small leftist groups. We know that no transition takes place instantaneously, but I have to say that the European debate about the Egyptian transition is depressing. It is crystallising as being between those who think that nothing needs to be done because the Arab Spring has already happened and that it is now the Arabs’ problem not ours, and those who think that nothing can now be done because the Arab Winter is here and we have no way of pressuring Egypt. We clearly have many ways of pressuring Egypt. We should say to the army and the Muslim Brotherhood that they should establish the beginnings of law and order, but for everyone in Egypt. However, we also need – I am concluding, Mr President – to do something else: if Europe is really concerned about politically liberal sectors, about Christians, about minorities and about young people, it should open up its thinking and its doors to the other side of the Mediterranean much more than it has been doing so far.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I believe we all view with concern the developments in North Africa. The Arab Spring, in which we invested so much hope, is being suffocated by half-hearted reforms and even bombs. In Egypt, a collective Mubarak has replaced the individual Mubarak, and few can predict what will happen next. The date of the presidential elections – in August at the earliest – is so far off that they can be postponed many times, and it is unclear whether democratic elections will bring to power people who divide society or unify it.</p>
      <p sl="cs">At the same time, people are dying. We see again that building peace is much more difficult that funding non-governmental organisations or sending in bomber aircraft. Real peace must be based on justice. Justice which respects indigenous local traditions. Justice which, along with elections, freedom of expression and freedom of association, also brings a dignified social life. All who genuinely respect human rights should now demand that there be no postponement of presidential elections and that power be handed over to a civilian government commanding support in parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is clear where the Liberal Group of the European Parliament stands – with the Egyptian people, their rights, freedoms and opportunities. This has been our group’s position for decades. We supported human rights when Mubarak was repressing speech, women, association and political parties and when he imprisoned politicians. We will continue to do so as long as is necessary, to stand by the people of Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the brave struggle for freedom that so many Egyptians undertook, and despite the toppling of the Mubarak regime, the promise of a true transition is hampered by the way in which the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is copying the oppressive tactics Mubarak used. It is time for civilian rule.</p>
      <p sl="en">The latest crackdown on internationally respected NGOs is one of many worrying examples. Repressing organisations working on human rights and fundamental freedoms in the name of nationalism is misplaced and dangerous. We support the Egyptian organisations that have spoken out against this move and call on the SCAF immediately to drop charges against international NGOs and their staff.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is an increasingly connected world, and Egypt cannot close itself off from the international community. It should not want this if it wants to see trade and the economy blooming, which is essential for the well-being of the Egyptian people. Europe would like to develop a genuine partnership with the new Egypt. We are willing to open up our markets, to take away trade barriers and to assist in the development of Egypt’s economy. However, the clear condition is genuine reforms in the field of human rights – and let me highlight especially women’s rights, democracy and respect for minorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is over 30 years now since I held seminars for young Egyptians in Wildbad Kreuth, the legendary education and training institution sponsored by the Hanns Seidl Foundation. The foundations affiliated to the German political parties have been active in politics and professional training, youth exchanges and human rights projects in Egypt for many decades. That is why it was an exciting development for these foundations when the democratic movement in Egypt began to mobilise. This makes it all the more disappointing to see how people in government, including people who have deep roots in the old regime, are taking arbitrary action against these foundations with the backing of the military, despite the fact that they are not just any old NGOs, but actually have a kind of public legitimacy. Our former President of Parliament, Mr Pöttering, as Chair of the Konrad-Adenauer Foundation, has been directly affected by this development.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to state quite clearly that we want to see an Egypt where pluralism and democracy flourish, not a country where two outmoded blocks collide, namely Islamism, on the one hand, and the military, on the other.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, one year on from the revolution that triggered the Arab Spring and from the fall of Mubarak, the Egyptian people are still waiting for democracy, the rule of law and social justice. The military regime has been repressing the driving forces of the revolution, along with the local and foreign NGOs that have been working towards holding free, transparent and credible elections, and towards creating a pluralist and democratic state that respects human rights, including the rights of Egypt’s minorities. It is absolutely unacceptable that the police and courts are harassing civil society organisations, both Egyptian and foreign, in the shape of the forced closure of offices, and the interrogation of and threats against staff.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union must support secular and democratic forces within Egypt by pressuring the regime to abolish the Mubarak-era law on the registration of NGOs. In view of recent statements by the Egyptian Minister for International Cooperation, there is an urgent need, at least, for the European Union to monitor carefully aid programmes whose implementation falls to that ministry and even to suspend them, if necessary, so as to prevent European funds from being spent on repressing Egyptian civil society. More for more should also result in less for less in countries in which the democratic aspirations of their people are being betrayed, as unfortunately seems to be the case in Egypt.</p>

Let us be clear: this is a way to silence voices that are critical of the ongoing human rights violations. These attacks constitute a severe violation of the right of freedom of association, as set out in Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The army and the Egyptian Government should immediately put an end to all forms of harassment or intimidation to which civil society organisations are subjected – whether directly or indirectly – and, in particular, should drop all criminal charges and stop the current media campaign against NGOs.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a protestor in Tahrir Square summed it up when he said that Egypt is like a house where the curtains have been changed but everything else is the same. It was a mass movement and strike wave that managed to topple Mubarak, but the new military rulers in the SCAF have not made life better for ordinary Egyptian people or met their democratic demands and aspirations. Unemployment is now at 12%, representing an increase; inflation has risen to over 10%; 40% of the population struggle to survive on less than USD 2 per day and austerity policies are being introduced by the regime. The military apparatus has remained completely intact, and the new rulers are using violence and trying to foster sectarian division to maintain a justification for their rule. That was seen most dramatically with the events at Port Said, with 74 people killed and hundreds injured in events that clearly had the hand of the security forces behind them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite that, the mass of people have not given up: they continue to struggle.

      <p sl="de">Above all, the serious attacks against the Coptic Christian members of the population are continuously increasing. Thus, for example, it has become dangerous, if not fatal, for Christian women – most of whom do not wear veils – to show themselves in public.

The resistance movement has gained strength from the Arab Spring and has spread, and Egypt is going through a critical period of transition.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as each and every one of you have said, one of the most important developments seen recently in Egypt were the parliamentary elections, the organisation and holding of which we welcomed. They clearly enabled the will of the people to be expressed transparently. As the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton, said recently, we are now keen to see the democratic transition continue under good conditions and presidential elections to be held as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Despite everything, and having listened attentively to all your speeches, ladies and gentlemen, the general human rights situation and the state of democracy in Egypt continue to cause real concern despite the progress made. We have thus called many times for the transfer of all power to democratically elected civil authorities, for the complete and definitive lifting of the state of emergency, for the end of military trials for civilians and for independent investigations to be carried out to identify and punish those responsible for the terrible transgressions witnessed during this period of transition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have regularly reminded our Egyptian partners of the importance of remaining faithful to the spirit of Tahrir Square, of ensuring that all citizens, both men and women, can participate fully and openly in the social and political life of their country, regardless of religion, belief or political affiliation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also concerned by the state, which many of you have pointed out, of non-governmental organisations in Egypt. Legislation repressing some NGOs has been unequivocally condemned in many EU declarations. This legislation, which is currently targeting several non-governmental organisations accused of breaking the law in favour of foreign interests, taints the image of Egypt in the eyes of the international community and raises doubts as to the ability of the provisional authorities to lead the democratic transition properly. We know in Europe that the existence of dynamic and free non-governmental organisations is one of the fundamental conditions of a modern and open society that is protective and respectful of citizens’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Freedom of association is also at the heart of the human rights policy pursued by the EU. Its respect and promotion are integral to the commitments Egypt has made within the framework of its association agreement with the European Union. We obviously respect the principle of judicial independence, but it is clear that the legislation currently governing non-governmental organisations in Egypt dates back to the Mubarak regime. Therefore, it is not surprising that it does not conform to international standards on the freedom of association or even that it is a barrier to the development of a free and dynamic civil society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why, ladies and gentlemen, we are urging the Egyptian authorities to quickly bring this crisis to an end by suspending the investigations under way until new legislation is in place which respects international standards. If acts of repression against non-governmental organisations should continue, this could and would have an impact on our relationship within the framework of our new Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union urges the Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to reverse the situation. This is of paramount importance to the credibility of the transition and for the quality of our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In our communication of March 2011 on the new European response to a changing neighbourhood, we established that our approach should be based on mutual responsibility, as well as a shared commitment to the universal values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in thanking you, ladies and gentlemen, for your questions, encouragement and advice, I assure you that the European Union is committed to supporting partners who clearly choose to develop real democracies, deeply rooted in respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very concerned about the situation in Egypt, particularly the ongoing investigations into activities of NGOs and political foundations, including the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the US International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Reportedly, a number of defendants were referred to the Cairo Criminal Court, as these organisations worked in Egypt without formal authorisation, although appropriate procedures were followed for such authorisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The work of these organisations is treasured by governments and civil society; they contribute to the establishment of the rule of law, good governance, and human rights. These are also values embraced by Egypt. People took to the streets and put an end to Mubarak’s regime to establish a more just society and secure the rule of law, good governance and human rights. Egyptians exercised their rights to free expression and association. These are also the rights at stake for the organisations currently under investigation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I call upon the Council and the Commission to raise these issues with the Egyptian Government. Criminal investigations against these organisations must stop. Egypt must guarantee free expression and association, and welcome a solid civil society and political pluralism, so that arguments, not weapons, cross in the public space.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I begin by saying that I regret what happened in the voting session at noon. I proposed then to remove the sentence relating to Japan from the resolution on the 19th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The reason was that we are debating and voting now on a joint resolution on the death penalty in this country and I believe this is much more subtle and nuanced than the punishment that remained in the text of the resolution mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In principle, I believe we can say the following: Japan is one of the EU’s closest partners and, obviously, if this country abolishes the death penalty, its gesture would influence, to a great extent, the other nations that still use this terrible instrument. On the other hand, if Japan is not prepared to abolish it now, I think it is wiser, on the one hand, to continue the public debate started in 2010, and, on the other hand, to continue or replicate a moratorium on executions that existed a decade ago in this country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate is inspired by the fact that the new Justice Minister in Japan has indicated that he intends to end the moratorium on the use of the death penalty and to resume executions in Japan.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with the previous speaker that the European Union and Japan have close and strong relations; we are partners in many areas of development and in the world, and we speak to the Japanese in this case as friends. We say to them that as a European Union, we can never support the use of the death penalty. In modern Japan, the death penalty has no place. We very much welcome the fact that there have been no executions in Japan since July 2010. I consider it real progress if Japan moves towards abolition. That is why the Minister’s statement was so disappointing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would hope that the Japanese Government will continue the work they have begun, with a study group in the Ministry of Justice which is examining the death penalty, and I hope they will listen to the strong abolitionist movement which exists in that country. There is no place in any modern state to take the lives of its own citizens. I urge Japan to consider abolishing the death penalty as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the end of the death penalty has been achieved in 96 countries across the world and only 23 countries actually carried out executions in 2010. To see any reduction in the numbers of legal killings is encouraging, but hearing about the possibility that executions in Japan will restart under a new Minister of Justice is a matter of great disappointment, both for me and for my political group, the Greens, who are completely opposed to the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to reports from Amnesty and the UN Committee on Torture, most of those people sentenced to death in Japan have given confessions under extreme duress. That duress could include physical abuse or sleep deprivation or denial of food and water and the use of a toilet and not being told of the date of their execution until the day itself arrives.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the death penalty is not fail-safe. You cannot acquit someone if they have already been killed. So I think the death penalty is abhorrent and cruel; it degrades both Japanese society and morality and it further punishes the prisoners’ families, who are innocent of any crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">So please join us in voting for a moratorium and the reactivation of the Japanese study group to stop death penalties.</p>

    <intervention id="4-536-000" speaker_id="97344" name="Paul Murphy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start with a quote from the French writer and activist Victor Hugo, who summed up the hypocrisy and barbarity of the death sentence when he said, ‘You hold up capital punishment as an example. Why? Because of what it teaches. And just what is it that you wish to teach by means of this example? That thou shalt not kill. And how do you teach that thou shalt not kill? By killing’.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a disgrace that the death penalty still exists in Japan, and it is a disgrace that the new Minister of Justice has announced that he does not want to continue the policy of caution of his predecessor and will, potentially, sign new execution orders. The barbarity of the situation in Japan is increased by the fact that, in many cases, prisoners and their legal representatives are not informed of the execution until the day that it takes place, and their family members are not informed until the execution has already taken place, meaning that they cannot say a last goodbye to their loved ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">From 2000 to 2009, Japan sentenced 112 people to death and executed 46, and there are currently 130 people on death row in Japan. Those convicted are kept in solitary confinement and wait an average of more than seven years – sometimes decades – in toilet-sized cells. Executions are carried out at advanced ages and despite signs of mental illness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Japan also has a 99% conviction rate, a figure which, critics say, is attributed to the use of forced confessions. In 2010, a number of other convictions – not death sentences – were overturned as a result of these coming out. Obviously, that cannot happen in the case of the death penalty. I think it is essential that we call for the immediate abolition of the death penalty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one knows a true friend by unconditional honesty; I hope to be a friend of the Land of the Rising Sun. However, I would call on Tokyo not to end the de facto moratorium on the death penalty. The death penalty assumes that the convict is not able to reform himself and furthermore, once carried out, it cannot be appealed against if misapplied. Even a remote chance of a mistake does not allow it to be applied in a contemporary democratic country that respects human rights. We must be consistent in our policies in the European Union and apply the same standards to all countries, from Belarus to Japan and from China to the USA.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in 2011, no death penalty was executed in Japan but the new Minister of Justice announced recently that executions may be resumed. The decision corresponds to the current majority of Japanese public opinion. According to certain polls, 80% of the population would support the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Under these circumstances, it is difficult to promote in Japan a public debate on changing the legislation or stopping the executions. However, the EU must encourage the authorities in Tokyo to address openly the subject, involving the whole society in discussions. At the same time, more transparency is needed on the conditions of detention and treatment of death row inmates. I also draw your attention to the intention of reducing the period of time for the execution of sentences. There are fears that, by doing so, it will be no longer possible to correct potential miscarriages of justice.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Union does not recognise the death penalty. Pursuant to Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, no person may be sentenced to death or executed. We expect our partner countries to have similar rules.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Japan should impose a formal moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. An open debate about the death penalty should be initiated in the country in order to reduce public support for this form of punishment, which is as high as 80%, because this support is mainly the result of a lack of proper knowledge. Japan also violates the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights through its treatment of prisoners on death row. Isolation, limited contact with other people, and harsh conditions make them particularly vulnerable to mental illness. Our resolution is the response to the announcement that the country will return to carrying out executions. We must firmly oppose the death penalty, wherever it is used, as a flagrant violation of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, some 130 people are on death row in Japan, and they are now at greater risk of being executed, because the new Justice Minister, Toshio Ogawa, publicly announced on 15 January 2012 that he thought that reintroducing the death sentence was a duty.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We in the European Parliament condemn various terrorist acts, such as the attack on the Tokyo underground in 1995, and we should not show any sign of sympathy towards such acts. The death penalty, however, is the wrong answer, and is a flagrant breach of a fundamental human right of every human being: namely, the right to life. We therefore appeal to the Japanese Government to abolish the death penalty in the country altogether.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Japan is once again starting to implement the death penalty. Previously, it had refrained from sentencing its citizens to death. Japan is one of the few industrialised countries that still carry out the death sentence. The reintroduction of the death penalty is based solely on an announcement by the Justice Minister, and a wider national debate is not even being considered.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The death penalty, however it is carried out, is always inhumane. The European External Action Service and the Commission should use all their potential resources, in terms of political dialogue and diplomacy, to put a stop to implementation of the death sentence in Japan. The European Union is a community of values and is committed to the complete abolition of capital punishment everywhere in the world, and nothing should deter us from that.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the only thing that the death penalty demonstrates is that society accepts and encourages premeditated murder. It is an utterly barbaric act that ought to be consigned to history. What is particularly barbaric in Japan is the fact that families are not even given a chance to say goodbye. However, this is also based on the belief that a person who has been given the death penalty does not have any expectations. Every person must be given a chance to improve themselves and to have the hope of a different future, the hope of improvement. If not a single person is given this hope of improvement and the opportunity to live, what hope is there for humanity?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Japan is not a barbaric country and therefore, I hope that the investigation will show that they are going to abolish their death penalty, and that is what we are calling for. The Justice Minister should maintain his predecessor’s position. Do not do anything until you have finally abolished the death penalty.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we have regularly intervened with our urgent resolutions when the death sentence has been passed, and twice already in this sitting. Opposition to the death penalty and due process are examples of European values and part of a wider international policy of agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The death penalty is still used in Japan. However, no one has been executed in the past 18 months, because the outgoing Justice Minister wished to pursue a more cautious approach. I hope that his successor, Toshio Ogawa, will change his mind and continue the moderate policy begun by Hideo Hiraoka, leading ultimately to the complete abolition of the penalty.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Significant steps have been taken worldwide in recent years to do away with the death penalty, and more and more countries have decided to end this form of punishment. If Japan were to join this group, it would not just be the welcome result of an international trend, but a symbolic gesture for the whole world from Asia’s leading democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Murphy, I appreciated your citation of Victor Hugo. Listening to you, Mr Murphy, I was reminded of another quote by Victor Hugo, who once wrote, somewhat prophetically, that wars between Europeans were like civil wars.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Coming back to Japan, I want to confirm that we have taken note, as have each and every one of you, of the declaration by the new Japanese Justice Minister, suggesting that he would be less reluctant than his predecessors to sign execution orders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On several occasions, the European Union has expressed its position on capital punishment, and has urged Japan to adopt a moratorium on executions and recognise the positive progress made towards the universal abolition of the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">No executions have taken place in Japan since July 2010. In the case of the last two executions, we expressed, through the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton, our profound regret for these executions and reminded Japan that the European Union is, and would remain, opposed to the recourse of capital punishment in all cases and under all circumstances. We have also called consistently for its universal abolition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union has welcomed and does welcome the efforts of those ministers of justice who preceded Mr Ogawa to encourage public debate on the death penalty in Japan, including the decision to put in place an ad hoc committee to examine this serious issue. We have also noted the declaration made by the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations in October 2011, stating their opposition to the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union and its Member States have organised many meetings and many conferences with members of the Japanese Government, with MEPs and with non-governmental organisations on the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will continue these efforts to explain the European position, both through diplomatic channels and by encouraging the public debate on this issue in Japan itself. To this end, we will be sponsoring a high-level public awareness seminar, which will take place in April in Tokyo, and which will involve civil society and members of the Diet.</p>

The right to life is the most fundamental human right. I would also like to remind Japan that it has publicly subscribed to the notion of a right to life, for example, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966. In my opinion, the time has finally come to make a start on the application of this right and its proper enforcement, with no exceptions whatsoever. I would like to direct this powerful appeal to the Japanese Government and Japanese lawmakers.</p>
