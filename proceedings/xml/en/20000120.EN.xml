      <p sl="unknown">Mr Bettino Craxi, former Member of the European Parliament, passed away yesterday in Hammamet, Tunisia. Bettino Craxi was a Member of this Parliament between 17 July 1979 and 20 August 1983 and between 25 July 1989 and 30 April 1992. Mr Craxi was also Acting President-in-Office of the Council in his capacity of Prime Minister of the Republic of Italy, a function which he fulfilled from 4 August 1984 until his resignation on 3 March 1987. Could I ask this House to observe a minute’s silence in his memory?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to raise a point before we commence the fisheries debate. Honourable Members may be aware of the appalling tragedy concerning the loss of a fishing vessel and all seven crew in Scotland. The Solway Harvester sank with all hands near the Isle of Man while fishing for scallops earlier this year. The seven-man crew came from the tiny village of Whithorn and neighbouring communities in Galloway, south-west Scotland.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that I will be speaking for all eight MEPs from Scotland and all of the colleagues in this House when I ask you to send a letter of condolence on behalf of the European Parliament to the First Minister of the Scottish parliament, Donald Dewar. This tragedy is perhaps a timely and sad reminder to us all, as we commence another debate on the fishing industry, that every day brave men and women risk their lives in one of the most dangerous occupations in the world to bring fish to our tables.</p>
      <p sl="en">I trust that the President will support this request.</p>

Unfortunately, these accidents are more frequent than we would all like and I would therefore like to point out that our committee has requested an own-initiative report on the causes of the risks and dangers associated with the fishing profession. I hope this report will be approved, because this long-suffering profession really needs the support of this House and of all of us.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A5-0096/1999) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the committee’s annual report to the Council and the European Parliament concerning the results of the multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets at the end of 1997 [COM(1999) 175 -C5-0109/1999 – 1999/2112(COS)].</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr Hudghton has asked to be given the floor regarding this matter.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="2338" name="Hudghton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">I hope that Members will appreciate my strong interest in this matter. I wish to move, under Rule 144, that Mr Cunha’s report be referred back to committee and I do so with the support of the Greens/ALE Group. On Monday, my colleague, Mr MacCormick, raised questions about the admissibility of part of paragraph 6 of Mr Cunha's report, and this involves very strong issues which may well be raised again today. But before we get to that point, I also believe that there are significant political and practical issues surrounding paragraph 6 and the proposals therein.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be in all our interests to try to seek a consensus in our approach to this. Therefore, further discussion by the Committee on Fisheries and indeed the possibility of an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs on this matter would be helpful to all sides of the argument.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of the doubts and some of the controversy which surrounds paragraph 6, a referral back would also allow, and should provide, an opportunity for further consultation both with the industry and with our experts in the Commission and elsewhere. I request that we vote to refer this back to committee and to return it to the House in due course, after further consideration. I also ask that this vote, if agreed, be a roll-call vote.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="1964" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Mr Hudghton, you are indeed submitting a formal request for a referral back to the Committee on Fisheries, under Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure. We all know the rules which apply there. In the case of such a request, the floor can be taken by one proponent and one opponent and, if necessary, by the rapporteur or the chairman of the committee. Is there a proponent of the request submitted just now?</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="4548" name="MacCormick" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as Mr Hudghton said, and as Members of the House will recall, I rose on Monday to say that I thought an element in this report is inadmissible because it lacks a legal basis. This is rather a "doomsday" weapon and I would be unhappy if we had to use it where there is a simpler method available to us for reconsidering the question before it finally comes back to the House.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a very important point. Paragraph 6 of the Cunha report, as I read it – and as many of my colleagues read it – effectively proposes undercutting the principle of relative stability which has, since 1983, been the very foundation of the common fisheries policy and which indeed Commissioner Fischler at his hearing before this House said was fundamental to the common fisheries policy. Introduction of a scheme of quota penalties would undercut it badly and that is what paragraph 6 suggests. That should be referred back and considered in committee, both in the Committee on Fisheries and in the Committee on Legal Affairs. I have pleasure in asking the House to support Mr Hudghton’s motion.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="1993" name="Fraga Estévez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am against the proposal that has been made.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is firstly because the Cunha report has been approved by a majority in the Committee on Fisheries. And not only that; the philosophy of this report is the one maintained by this Parliament in successive reports on the evaluation of the MAGPs.</p>
      <p sl="es">In response to Mr MacCormick’s specific question, on whether paragraph 6 undercuts, or not, the principle of relative stability, I would point out that paragraph 6 in no way undercuts that principle. It simply proposes, as a possible penalty against those who fail to comply with the MAGPs, who are the people who do most harm to resources, a temporary suspension of quotas, which is not a definitive suspension, nor does it imply the transfer of quotas from some Member States to others.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, the principle of relative stability is maintained as are – and this frightens some people – the key points on distribution of the principle of relative stability. Therefore, I would like to tell you that there is not the slightest danger of that principle, the sacred principle of the common fisheries policy, being attacked. It simply proposes serious penalties – and because they hurt a lot, some people will complain – which should make the protection of resources more effective.</p>

    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="2156" name="Cunha" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">Very briefly, the principle of relative stability is not in question for the simple reason that there is no transfer of quotas between Member States. On the other hand, we are talking about a temporary suspension of quotas in order to force Member States to meet the objectives of the MAGPs. This would be further clarified by the approval of Amendment No 3 tabled by Mr Ford. As rapporteur, I propose that you vote in favour of this amendment. Secondly, the aim of paragraph 6 of my report is precisely to encourage the European Union to create an effective system of penalties. If we fail to create penalties forcing countries to meet the objectives of the MAGPs, then these MAGPs will not only serve no purpose but, more than this and much more seriously, they will act as a form of discrimination between those Member States which do comply and reduce their fleets and those which do not comply and are not penalised.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it surprises me that some MEPs are once again on the attack, with the same argument that they have used before, because the previous point also related to the admissibility of paragraph 6. I believe that the great majority of Members have made it clear that we are in favour of this paragraph, and we have already voted on it. If you like, I will repeat the same arguments. Paragraph 6 does not undercut the principle of relative stability because it respects that principle and the key points on distribution. The previous speaker said that there are doubts. We would have to be sure, if we wanted to reject paragraph 6. If you have any doubts, clarify them first. I have no doubts, Mr President, and this Parliament has already expressed its opinion.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I wish to raise another point of order, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, with regard to what has been said here. We have already voted on the basis. We have voted on the question of whether one of the principles contained in paragraph 6 was admissible or not. A large majority have rejected referral back to committee, on the understanding that this point was admissible. We cannot take another vote, with all this manoeuvring, on the same question, when they are now saying that they are applying Rule 143, since the same cause for inadmissibility is being cited. I would like to point out to you that Rule 143 speaks of inadmissibility for formal reasons, such as its not being on the agenda, a lack of linguistic versions, etc., but for not reasons of basis, especially if it has already been discussed and voted on. We cannot deal once again with another procedural motion, using another Rule, when this House has already voted on the basis of the question and has already said that it should not be referred back to committee. Therefore, there should be no more parliamentary manoeuvring and filibustering and I believe that the question should be cleared up, and it has been cleared up, by a majority in this House.</p>

    <intervention id="4-029" speaker_id="2156" name="Cunha" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has prepared a report on the first year of application of the fourth generation of multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets, known as MAGP IV, for the period 1997-2001. This report shows that, in 1997, the Community fleet was reduced by 2% in terms of gross tonnage and by 3% in terms of power.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, on 1 January 1998 the Community fleet actually exceeded the MAGP IV final objectives by approximately 16% in terms of power and 7% in terms of gross tonnage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, this seemingly optimistic assessment of the effectiveness of the MAGPs in matching the size of the Community fleet to the availability of fish stocks is subject to some major reservations. The first stems from the difficulties in comparing objectives between MAGP III and MAGP IV due to the change in the criteria for measuring and segmenting the fleets. The second reservation is that we are continuing to use different measurement criteria in each Member State which makes any assessments difficult to compare. The Commission itself gives a warning in its report about the unreliability of the data supplied to us.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The third reservation about this seemingly optimistic assessment stems from the fact that the meeting of these objectives varies greatly among the Member States. Two Member States have not met these objectives and one has provided data in an unacceptable form. On the other hand, there are Member States such as Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom which have already met or even exceeded, in the case of Portugal, the final objectives laid down in MAGP IV.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a result, I am basically proposing two types of measure in my report. The first involves standardising the criteria for the measurement and segmentation of the fleets. In this way, a clear and constant comparative assessment of the Community fleet can be made in each Member State. This is fundamental to the effectiveness of the MAGPs. The second type of measure concerns the need to have a Community regulation which specifically establishes an effective penalty system. It is only in this respect that I suggest in my report, by way of example I must stress, the suspension of quotas for Member States in breach of these objectives in order to force them to comply.</p>
      <p sl="pt">(§) Amendment No 13 by Mr Ford should therefore be adopted in order to underline that this suspension is temporary. I would stress that this does not involve any transfer of quotas between Member States and there is no violation of the principle of relative stability. This is simply a temporary suspension to put political pressure on countries to comply with the MAGPs. This point is fundamental because it has been proven that financial penalties within the FIFG serve no purpose. Without this measure, Member States will have no incentive to meet the established objectives. Furthermore, with a situation in which some countries comply and others do not, if we do not penalise those which do not comply, this will lead to major discrimination in the application of the common fisheries policy between Member States. It will also penalise some fishermen more than others. Finally, if these two types of measure suggested in my report are not adopted, the multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets will not only serve no purpose but, worse than that, they will act as a form of discrimination and distortion of competition between Member States, shipowners and fishermen. In this case, it would be better to dispense with them altogether.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-030" speaker_id="1993" name="Fraga Estévez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, this year we once again have before us a Commission report on the Member States’ compliance with the measures relating to the restructuring of the fleet, adopted in 1997. It once more beggars belief that the Commission has been able to draw up a report with the jumble of information sent to it by some Member States which, in our opinion, makes it a practically useless document.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission report indicates four modes of behaviour on the part of Member States with regard to their obligations to comply with the Multiannual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs). A few, incidentally, as well as complying with the global objectives for restructuring the fleet, send harmonised data – as Community regulations require. Others, the majority, continue to send data mixing up the GTs and the GRTs, which makes it very difficult to measure their degree of compliance with regard to the reduction in tonnage. A third group consists of two Member States who do not comply with the global objectives of the MAGPs at all. Lastly, a third Member State sends no data whatsoever and has failed to do so for three years.</p>
      <p sl="es">This constitutes an intolerable form of discrimination, not only amongst countries which comply with their global objectives at the expense of imposing great sacrifices on their fleets, but also amongst those which, while not complying with them, at least respect their obligation to publicise their data, as a result of which they are penalised for the fact that that data is not in compliance.</p>
      <p sl="es">The same does not happen with a Member State which, ignoring all relevant Community regulations, has withheld its data for three consecutive years and therefore, since this data is not available, cannot even be penalised. This is such a travesty that only through a great sense of responsibility will we be able to persuade the compliant States to continue to adapt their fleets to existing resources and not the opposite.</p>
      <p sl="es">The sad result is that we continue to impose these obligations while not really knowing, at the moment, how many vessels the Community fleet consists of and, less still, its tonnage. In this regard, the Commission has made it known that a study by experts will be available next month on the sizes of the fleets in all Member States, apart from one, and I would like to know whether that is the usual one.</p>
      <p sl="es">Does that mean that, next year and in subsequent years, Mr Cunha will have to return to present us with another of his excellent reports on the evaluation of the degree of compliance with the MAGPs, warning of the danger caused by some Member States who continue to believe that the safeguarding of Community resources is someone else’s problem?</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, this situation has to end. Therefore, for very good reasons, our rapporteur is calling for penalties, in the form of reductions in fishing quotas, not only for those who do not comply, but also for those who hide the facts and commit fraud.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that the penalties contained in the new FIFG are a step forward, but they are not sufficient to prevent a situation of non-compliance which has already been going on for too long. We therefore support the rapporteur’s demand for measures which will act as a genuine deterrent and we consider, given what some people think, that this type of penalty is totally appropriate: firstly, because the situation has reached the point where we have to strike where it hurts most; secondly, because, although quotas are not included in structural policy, non-compliance with the MAGPs threatens resources. The protection of resources is the ultimate aim of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, after what has happened this morning, I would like to say one thing: while I have always been convinced by the quality of Mr Cunha’s reports and proposals on this subject, this time I am even more convinced, and I believe that he really has put his finger on the problem. I would like the other two institutions, which have to adopt resolutions on the subject, to realise that the application of effective penalties could really resolve the problem of excess fleet which the Community is currently suffering and thereby protect our resources and, above all, our fishermen.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-031" speaker_id="4349" name="Miguélez Ramos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, in my view, the common fisheries policy is essentially a collection of regulations with which all parties must comply. Let us imagine a chess match in which a player moves his bishops diagonally – as the rules dictate – but uses his knights as if they were rooks and in which, furthermore, he tries to carry on playing after he has suffered a checkmate. Let us imagine, also, that the match referee is looking in the other direction. That seems to me to be basically what the last Commission did. We trust that the current Commission will fulfil its mission as a guardian of the Treaties and that it does not ‘let so many goals in’.</p>
      <p sl="es">The preservation of fishing resources depends, rightly, on respect for the agreements on TACs and quotas, temporary fishing bans and commitments made by Member States on the reduction of their fleets, and, as such, if, from this delicate house of cards which we are all building, someone were to remove a card, the whole construction would collapse.</p>
      <p sl="es">Compliance with the MAGPs is an essential requirement if we are to safeguard the balance between resources and fleet capacity. The degree of compliance amongst the Member States with their obligations, laid down in the MAGPs, varies enormously, as this report demonstrates.</p>
      <p sl="es">This report indicates countries which, through great economic and social effort, and with enormous effort on the part of their fishing fleets and their people, have complied fully. This is recognised by the Commission and Mr Cunha in his report.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Cunha, who I congratulate on his excellent report, also indicates the degree to which some Member States do not comply and the clear lack of will of certain other countries who, furthermore, refuse to provide reliable data. As the rapporteur has explained so well, it is incredible that the Commission has shown so much tolerance towards a country which, for so many years, has failed to provide reliable information on the situation of its fleet. This has probably been possible as the result of the political weakness of the previous Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to refer to other reasons which are the responsibility of the Commission and the Member States, because it is necessary, in this new stage, for them both to make an effort to harmonise the reference criteria in force for measuring the tonnage and power of vessels. This is the only way we can prevent some countries from out-manoeuvring the regulations, which is what some are currently doing. The Commission will also – as Mr Cunha says in his report – have to be stricter with regard to the segmentation criteria of the different national fleets, improve the definition of geographical areas and use its power to impose penalties, although of a temporary nature, to oblige States to fulfil their obligations with regard to reducing fleet sizes.</p>
      <p sl="es">We socialists demand that the Commission make a commitment, here in this Parliament, to put an end, not only to its tolerance of non-compliance with the MAGPs, but also to the lack of transparency of certain States whose attitude simply prejudices those other countries who are eager to fulfil all the objectives laid down in the MAGPs.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the exercise of its competences, the Commission must protect the Community interest.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-032" speaker_id="4442" name="Busk" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, may I start by congratulating Mr Cunha on a splendid report which we can, to a very large extent, support. We are looking very seriously at the Commission’s remarks in the annual report on the results of the multiannual guidance programmes for the Community fishing fleet. It should also be pointed out in this regard that the report dates from 1997 and that it is now the year 2000. The annual report is characterised by a series of changes to the reference basis and, as such, by complicated evaluations concerning the measurements, which become still more flimsy because not all Member States keep to the programmes. Some countries fulfil the final objectives for MAGP IV, and other countries hesitate or are very behind. There is also talk of there not being reliable data from other countries. It is important to point out that there may perhaps be major inaccuracies, since there are no uniform criteria for comparison.</p>
      <p sl="da">Mr Cunha refers in his report to the fact that the goal of the multiannual guidance programmes is to create a balance between the available fishing resources and the common fishing fleet’s activities. It is to be emphasised that a considerable reduction in the fishing fleet is a prerequisite for securing sustainable development within the sector. Here, I am thinking especially of young people just starting out. I am thinking about investment in new vessels. It is also a clear prerequisite that the socio-economic burden should be distributed justly and equally between the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="da">We are concerned about the fact that a number of the Member States are negligent – in fact, almost indifferent – about submitting reliable data concerning the status of their fishing fleets. It is also very obvious that a number of Member States even show little interest in reducing the capacity of their fishing fleets in accordance with the objective of the programmes and with the resolutions contained therein.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Committee on Fisheries urges the Commission and the Member States to adopt uniform and comparable criteria for measurements, and this must be an absolute requirement. The Commission is also urged to increase its supervision of developments within the Member States’ fleets. This, too, we fully support. In addition to tighter supervision, the Commission is urged to implement or, in certain cases, to intensify measures to compel the Member States to comply with the stipulations requiring them to reduce the sizes of their fishing fleets. Such measures may include refusing to help them renew and modernise their fishing fleets and bringing legal proceedings before the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="da">Mr Cunha proposes that the Member States’ shortcomings in submitting data may lead to fishing quotas being reduced. We do not think that this is the correct way of going about things, for we do not believe that fishermen should be punished because of sloppiness displayed by the Member States. In connection with this amendment, we have asked for split voting. We have also requested split voting in connection with the reference to relative stability, since we think that things have been mixed together here in a way which might perhaps distort the principle established in the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">To put this debate into perspective, let us remember that the current MAGP, the fourth generation, falls far short of the scientific advice provided by the Lassen committee. They recommended deep cuts in the EU's fleets to allow stocks to recover. The Council could not accept that so the final regulation calls for relatively modest cuts. Thus, the combined EU fleet is only supposed to reduce by 2.3% in terms of tonnage and 3% in power during the five years of the programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Commission's report shows, by the beginning of 1998, after only one year of the programme, the aggregate EU fleets were already far below these targets. Rather than showing how good the Member States have been, what this actually shows is that the required reductions were very modest indeed and far less than was necessary. Nonetheless, and this is the point of real contention, many Member States have not abided by the regulation and many of the fleets are too large. What does one do with these Member States who place themselves above Community law and ignore their obligations?</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has proposed several things: it can withhold structural funds, but that is only a valid tool if the Member States actually utilise the funds. It can take Member States to court but that is time-consuming, expensive and difficult. In its proposal for the recent renewal of the FIFG, the Commission suggested that non-complying Member States should be denied access to permits to fish under third-country fishing agreements. Predictably, the Council refused.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some means must be found that will be effective to persuade or force Member States to respect their legal obligations. Mr Cunha asked the Commission to consider the possibility of quota sanctions if the MAGP objectives were not respected. Some consider this to be in breach of the principle of relative stability, but let us remember that relative stability is only one principle in the common fisheries policy. The basic regulation also says that Community management systems must enable a balance to be created on a permanent basis between resources and exploitation. In other words, if the stocks all crash, relative stability of a zero quota is not worth an awful lot.</p>
      <p sl="en">We think that the idea at least deserves serious consideration. There is already a precedent in Regulation 847/96 on the multiannual TACs. Under that regulation, if a Member State exceeds its quota in certain fisheries, its quota the following year is reduced, not just for the amount of over-fishing, but by an additional amount which increases, the greater the amount of over-fishing that has taken place.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is clearly a penalty but it was not viewed as being in breach of relative stability. Perhaps Mr Cunha's suggestion could have been a little more carefully worded to make it clear that any reduction would not be permanent but of a limited duration, and that is why we will support the amendment by the PSE on this point to include "temporary". I am sure everyone will agree that some way must be found to ensure that Member States follow the law.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the Commission’s analysis of the first year of application of the fourth generation of multiannual guidance programmes shows that very different situations exist in the Member States. While some countries are not meeting the objectives laid down or are not providing reliable data, others are not only meeting these objectives but are exceeding them, as in the case of Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, at the beginning of 1998, the Community fleet exceeded the MAGP IV final objectives in terms of both tonnage, by 16%, and power, by 7%. On the other hand, France and the Netherlands were unable to meet the MAGP objectives and Italy failed to provide reliable data. Yet Portugal not only exceeded the European average but, with a reduction of 38% in terms of tonnage and 21% in terms of power, was the country which reduced the fishing effort of its fleet to the greatest extent. This has, of course, involved decommissioning, job losses and a threat to the survival of nearly 180 important communities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is therefore a clear imbalance in the fisheries situation within the European Union, even taking into account the necessary caution which must be used in analysing the data presented in the report, as underlined by the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For Portugal, the current situation is particularly serious and basically results from a common fisheries policy which takes no account of the specific conditions in each Member State. Having said this, the national politicians must also accept some responsibility as they want to be the best at complying with the European rules.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is now clear that a fisheries policy based on scant support for fleet modernisation and renewal, on measures encouraging the decommissioning of vessels and the cessation of activity, and on deteriorating working conditions and lower incomes for fishermen, combined with strong foreign competition, has led to a drastic reduction in the national fleet. This is causing Portuguese fishermen to emigrate to join fleets of other countries, particularly those which are not meeting their MAGP objectives and which are even increasing their fishing capacity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A major overhaul of the common fisheries policy is needed, and not just of the specific issue of the MAGPs. Particular attention must be paid to the specific aspects of each country. Special support must be provided for the renewal and modernisation of the fleets of Member States which have already met their objectives. Measures to support the survival of fishing communities must be established. An improvement in the living and working conditions of fishermen must be ensured and compensation must be provided for closed seasons, as in the case of the sardine closed season in Portugal, or for any other necessary reductions in the fishing period.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the implementation of the fourth multiannual guidance programme for the fishing sector is a particularly difficult task. Under previous programmes, this sector has already made considerable efforts to adapt the capacity of its fleet. Despite this, the Commission is demanding that it continue to reduce capacity. Below a certain threshold, however, the level of the fleet is no longer adequate to absorb port and commercial infrastructure and make it profitable, which is likely to lead to completely unjustifiable relocations and reductions in the numbers of fishing vessels, as long as we remain within our catch quotas. The guidance programmes designed as programmes to continually reduce the fleet should not become permanent features of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why the Members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot adopt the Cunha report as it stands. For that reason, our colleague, Dominique Souchet, has tabled five amendments that aim to point out that the catch capacity should be adapted, and not necessarily systematically and continuously reduced. In fact, our aim is to ensure the future of the fishing fleets of the Member States of the European Union. Our amendments also make it clear that it is difficult to make a comparison between the third and fourth programmes owing to the introduction of new elements, such as the composition of the catches and the nature of the fishing gear. They also draw attention to the fact that it is difficult for the Member States to provide the detailed and numerous amounts of information requested of them within very short time limits.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, our Group is against paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution. In fact, it is not up to the European Parliament to request that the penalties applicable in the event of failure to respect the programmes or the notification procedure can consist of additional reductions in quotas. Firstly, in our view, there is no legal basis for that and, in any case, it is not necessary to distort the principle of the guidance programmes whose aim is not, I repeat, to make fishing activity in Europe die out, but, on the contrary, to control it in order to ensure its long-term future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, owing to the recent oil slick in France, our Group has also tabled two amendments that request a freeze on the implementation of the reduction programmes for the areas affected by the disaster. The whole European Parliament has this week been moved by this disaster. From our Group, Dominique Souchet and Philippe de Villiers have visited the scene of the disaster, in Vendée, and have told us how urgent the need to undertake measures to show our support is. It is clear that fishing activities in these disaster-stricken areas are going to become more precarious for a time. Under such conditions, the desire to apply restrictive measures in a uniform manner across the European Union, without taking account of these exceptional situations, could lead to further disasters.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my party's policy is to oppose the common fisheries policy on the basis that fisheries should be managed solely by individual Member States. It follows, therefore, that I should oppose the multiannual guidance programme or "Magpie" as we call it in the UK, that familiar black and white bird that is so good at indiscriminately killing juveniles and also is a well known thief – which is very much the UK fishing industry's view of the common fisheries policy. But even if I was not opposed to it on general grounds, I would oppose the Cunha report on the grounds of its specific contents.</p>
      <p sl="en">My principal reason for doing so stems from the very words of the report such as paragraph (a) on page 4 which points out "an appropriate resource conservation policy is an essential requirement in order to guarantee the future of a profitable and competitive Community fisheries sector". Stressing the word "appropriate", my problem is that "Magpie" is not an appropriate resource conservation policy. From a UK perspective, the central flaw is that we have had to accept a large number of foreign trawlers into our waters over which we have no direct control. For us it is not a question of too many boats chasing too few fish, as the Commission would have us believe; for us it is too many EU boats chasing too few fish.</p>
      <p sl="en">A more fundamental flaw is the quota system. The most recent estimates are that 3.7 million tonnes of fish are thrown back dead every year. This is a true environmental disaster. We have to attack the quota system. It has been totally ineffective at controlling the fisheries resource in any way at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will be against this Cunha report because it is creating yet more sanctions. It is making criminals of yet more fishermen.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I sincerely believe that the report carried out by our rapporteur, Mr Cunha, is a great report and it is very timely, as this morning has illustrated. I warmly congratulate him on it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will speak clearly and briefly. We constantly refer to the existing problem of the relationship between the size of the fishing fleet and current fishing resources. We speak of excess fishing capacity, of the overfishing of resources by an over-sized fleet. The Commission implemented the Multiannual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs), intended to rebalance this relationship. However, it is also blatantly clear that the application of the MAGPs varies considerably from State to State. Some have complied completely and have reduced their fleet by 40%, others have not complied; others even refuse to provide the data on their compliance, and the most serious thing is that the non-compliant countries expect to be treated in the same way as those which have carried out the very difficult task of reducing their fishing capacity with the subsequent economic and social sacrifices.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Cunha’s report is therefore important and appropriate. It points out to the Commission the basic defects: less than rigorous plans, unequal control and, above all, a lack of homogeneity in the criteria applied by the different States in measuring their fleets. As if this were not enough, the report highlights the lack of effective penalties for those who do not comply, which, to top it all, means that certain mechanisms which could be useful in terms of achieving the objective for which they were created, are simply no use.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore necessary to harmonise the criteria and penalise those who do not comply, by means of effective measures, such as that proposed, by way of example, in Mr Cunha’s report, involving the reduction or suspension – at least temporary, having accepted Mr Ford’s amendment – of the quotas for non-compliant countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">We hope that Parliament will adopt this report, as the Committee on Fisheries has accepted it, with the amendments which the rapporteur has referred to, and that the Commission and the Council will take good note, so that they may give new life to a key instrument for achieving the objectives of the current common fisheries policy, based on sustainable development in the sector, which is what we in the Committee on Fisheries are defending.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to make one fundamental point on the Cunha report. I have some sympathy with the political position that our nationalist colleagues put forward this morning with respect to paragraph 6, but in terms of dealing with it they took the wrong approach. It is not appropriate and we voted not to send the report back to committee. Nor do we support the notion that paragraph 6 is inadmissible. The best approach is to vote on the report and to follow the political logic.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have tabled an amendment which substitutes "temporary removal of quotas" for the suggestion in paragraph 6 that it should be "permanent" if Member States do not comply with the regime. If that amendment or anything similar is carried we will be supporting the report. If it is not, then we will be opposing it. Such an amendment will put pressure on governments to obey the law without condemning the principle of relative stability which, as we are all so well aware, has been the basis of the common fisheries policy since 1983. This is the best approach, the one we are going to follow, and we hope that the other political groups will allow the report to go through with the necessary amendments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have two concerns about paragraph 6 of Mr Cunha's report, on which I congratulate him as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, the automatic reduction in quotas for Member States in breach. My concern is that the effect of this is actually to impose the sanctions in the wrong place. If we reduce quotas, it is fishermen and their livelihood that will suffer. It is simply contrary to the principles of justice to punish some people for the faults of others.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second concern is with the reference to the relative stability principle. In my view, the argument that the paragraph does undermine that principle is a compelling one. As it stands, there is a reference to an automatic reduction of quotas with no specification as to extent or time-limits. This could lead to a major erosion of traditional fishing rights. It is very different from the reduction in the case of over-fishing, which simply restores the balance. I am aware of the amendment that suggests that the reduction should simply be a temporary one, but I think it would be far safer to take out the references to quotas and the relative stability principle altogether. I accept entirely that we need serious and effective penalties but please let us make sure that they respect the principles of the common fisheries policy and fall on those who deserve them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Cunha's report is an important one, seeking as it does to review compliance by Member States with their obligations. Clearly, if European Union rules and regulations are agreed, then there is a responsibility on Member States and governments to comply. I have no difficulty whatsoever in supporting that principle, but how should a defaulter be penalised? Is there a need in this case for new sanctions? If so, are the sanctions proposed by Mr Cunha likely to be effective?</p>
      <p sl="en">Paragraph 6 attempts to address the issue of quota sanctions which Mr Cunha and Mrs Fraga Estévez support so strongly. I make no apology for having raised points of order on this issue earlier in the morning.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal to utilise automatic quota cuts is doubtful in its legality, impractical and almost unenforceable and punishes the fishermen – not Member States, as my Scottish colleague said a moment ago; and most importantly, threatens to undermine the principle of relative stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Fraga Estévez has rightly reminded us that quota penalties have been raised in this context in previous debates in this House; in 1998 a similar proposal was debated, and it might even have had the same author. The then Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, in her response to that debate said, and I quote: "one amendment contains proposals for sanctions. The Commission does not agree with this proposal for several reasons. Firstly, because the automatic reduction in quotas for non-complying countries seriously undermines the basic principle of the common fisheries policy, which is that of relative stability.” She summed up saying – I quote again: “I would therefore ask Parliament to reconsider a reduction in quotas as a sanction because of these possible implications.”</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the new Commission will take the same line following today's debate. I am sorry that Mr Fischler is not here to answer for himself although he did, at this hearing, make very positive comments about relative stability, which I welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">Amendments to paragraph 6 have been tabled but I cannot support them because both accept the principle of using quota cuts as a penalty. Quota-setting should be based solely on science and conservation objectives, not used as an automatic penalty. If defaulting Member States are to be encouraged to comply with their MAGP targets, then an effective system of sanctions must be targeted at governments – not at fishermen. We have asked for split votes on paragraph 6 and I hope that we will have the opportunity to exercise these. I hope that Members of this House will oppose, in principle, the use of quota penalties as a deterrent in this issue.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in this debate on multiannual guidance programmes, we have to be clear about the ultimate goal of the policy. In essence, it aims to protect fish stocks by imposing restraints on fishing quotas. To enable the sector to meet this quota, the European Union has imposed an additional measure on the Member States to reduce their fleets. The multiannual guidance programmes are not therefore a goal in themselves but a means in the service of quota schemes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, I have to note that the rapporteur is confusing the means with the end. This is evident from the fact that he urges that a quota reduction be imposed on Member States which do not meet the multiannual guidance programmes, irrespective of whether or not they observe the quota. In this way, he elevates the multiannual guidance programmes to the highest goal and degrades the quotas by just thinking of them as handy tools. As such, Member States which do not fully meet the objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes but do observe the quota – which is, after all, the ultimate goal – are being disproportionately penalised. For example, take the Netherlands. It has, admittedly, reduced its fleet to a lesser extent, but manages to remain within the quota by introducing a sea day scheme. Would it not be much fairer to impose an extra reduction on the fleet of Member States which exceed the quota constantly and which, as such, constitute an actual threat ?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the reliability of data on the fleet capacity of the various Member States. Policy based on unreliable information is poor policy and is harmful to the integrity of the public authority. This is why I would call upon the Committee – as a matter of urgency – to have the data of the Member States verified thoroughly by an expert and independent organisation.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-043" speaker_id="4492" name="Maat" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Cunha for his great expertise. I noticed that he managed to bring a number of aspects with regard to the multiannual guidance programme into the limelight. He observes, rightly so, that a great deal of data is unreliable, that it is difficult to obtain the correct data and this is one of the problems which the European fisheries policy is facing. So far, I have a great deal of sympathy for this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My criticism focuses on a number of other points; namely, once you establish that data is unreliable and that a programme is, in fact, a supplementary programme, but then support sanctions which are extremely far-reaching, then this can lead to discrimination against Member States and certainly against fishermen, because the moment you realise that data is unreliable, you also have to look at the sanctions you are using. Otherwise, it could well be that countries which fail to carry out part of the guidance programmes adequately and are being penalised for it – because this is a fact in current policy – are being more heavily penalised, whilst countries which have not properly collected their data are being safeguarded against this. This is, to my mind, unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I would like to argue in favour of, also in the framework of this report, is that we arrive at improved data comparison within the European Union. Harmonisation of data, better inspection and, based on this, the development of a specific policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second point which I would like to advocate in this context is that when sanctions are imposed, these should be restricted to the policy adopted, in this case the multiannual guidance programme. This means that Member States which cannot meet this programme in one way or another can be faced with possible sanctions, which means that it may well be possible that they will receive less funding. This is a sanction which quite simply goes hand in hand with the policy. I would like to underline this, otherwise – as I do fundamentally disagree with the multiannual guidance programme from this point of view, because it focuses too little on the enforcement of quota, if this is a means to an end – I fear that especially Member States which use a slightly different system or which monitor the observance of the quota very well, will be affected more so than others. In this context, I would very much like to back the position of the fishing countries around the North Sea and the North Atlantic region.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I remain of the opinion, Mr President, that I value the purpose of Mr Cunha’s programme and his report, but I have very strong, fundamental objections when he proposes possible sanctions in the area of cutting quotas, even on a temporary basis. This tool cannot be applied in this case. It is a totally different policy and, in my opinion, this Parliament should reject this particular aspect as a matter of principle and needs to fight for a better fisheries policy with better control. On this basis, we can also pursue a better policy. This is the first step we need to take. A second step is to observe the quota. We have other means of doing this. The third is to ensure that a multiannual guidance programme is geared to restructuring and nothing else.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I must congratulate Mr Cunha on his excellent report. The Commission report analyses the performance of the Member States and shows that Portugal fully met the objectives established for all the fleet segments. It also reveals that the data contained in the Portuguese vessel registers correctly matches the information presented in the Portuguese Government’s report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The 1997 report only failed to provide data on five vessels in the fleet. This is now being corrected as data is only missing on three vessels. This aspect of compliance with the MAGP objectives, which could and should be positive, has had negative repercussions at national level, both within the fisheries sector and in the press and public opinion in general. This is because compliance with these objectives normally means a reduction in the capacity and size of the fleet. Those who comply should not be penalised and this must be explained to the fishermen. This is why we suggest effective penalties such as the temporary reduction of quotas for Member States found to be in breach of, or failing to meet the deadlines for, submitting data.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This situation must be put into perspective. When it is said that increasing numbers of vessels are being decommissioned, this is not strictly true, at least in comparison with the current situation. Therefore, in Portugal in the period from 1992 to 1995, 144 new projects were presented. In the period from 1996 to 1999, 194 new projects were presented. In 1999, 40 new projects were presented. One important aspect to which the Commission’s attention must be drawn is that the fleet must be adjusted in accordance with the need to protect on-board working conditions and the health and safety conditions for the fish. This may sometimes require an increase in gross tonnage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I must ask the Commission, if an MAGP V is established in the future, not to start from zero, but to take into account the efforts already made by the Member States and the results obtained by these in previous MAGPs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to say that I fully support the report prepared by Mr Cunha. While I have reservations, I do not see any other way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is interesting to think that those Member States that have the great fleets today built up those fleets in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In Ireland, we feel thoroughly aggrieved at the size of our quotas and the capacity of our fleet. We must remember that when the other maritime nations – Britain, Spain and Holland – were building up their fleets in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there was actually a law which forbade the transport of fish in Irish ships. So we arrived in this century with the same sort of boat, the little curragh, in which St Brendan sailed to America in the eighth century. That is why the fishermen I represent feel very aggrieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, the Dutch have seven times as many ships over 24 metres as Ireland, even though we have much more by way of resources in the ocean. I want to record the fact that we are not satisfied and to say that if we exploit the seas the way we should and if we conserve and manage our fisheries the way we ought, we could probably take twice as much fish from European waters as we do. We would not have any more jobs, as the capacity is already there to do it, but we would make more than double the profits we make at the moment. A sensible system of conservation and restraint for the present will guarantee the resource for generations to come. I sincerely hope that, when we have done this and despite the fact that "relative stability" has become a sacred principle here, a country like Ireland on the edge of the Atlantic with vast resources will one day enjoy a more equitable share.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the aim of multiannual guidance programmes in the fisheries industry is to ensure that countries observe agreed fishing quotas. Since Member States failed to do this, it was necessary to impose fleet reductions. In the Netherlands, a solution typical of our country was opted for. In tandem with the fisheries sector, agreements were concluded to reduce the number of sea days. In this way, modern, profitable ships do not need to be taken out of circulation, companies do not go bankrupt and, most importantly, of course, the Netherlands fishes within the quota imposed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Cunha’s report, which, by the way, I value, now seeks to automatically reduce the quotas of countries which fail to observe the multiannual guidance programme. This goes against not only every principle of justice, but also puts the cart before the horse. Indeed, the objective of the multiannual guidance programme is to force countries to fish within their quota. It would be absurd to impose a penalty reduction, especially an automatic penalty reduction, on a country which is fishing within its quota, such as the Netherlands. In this way, the means and the end are reversed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is also too early for such a measure. The Netherlands is one of the few countries which provides clear information on its fleet capacity and fishing quota. Until such time as there is a uniform way in which this information can be measured in all Member States, we cannot actually examine whether all Member States observe these objectives.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, by keeping within the fishing quota by reducing the number of days they go to sea, the Dutch fishermen also observe the Working Time Directive. Although the fisheries sector is, strictly speaking, excluded from this directive, fishermen are also entitled, of course, to suitable rest periods. Reducing the number of sea days can contribute towards this. Mr President, my delegation will vote against the report if paragraph 6 of the resolution is adopted.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Cunha for his excellent report and express my appreciation for the resolution on the annual Commission report on the Multiannual Guidance Programmes. I would like to say that both this report, and the previous resolution prepared by Mr Cunha on compliance with the multiannual programmes in previous years, have been of great benefit to the Commission in drawing up new regulations, specifically the application of the FIFG funds, approved for the next few years.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission is in complete agreement with Mr Cunha and other speakers with regard to the importance of the Multiannual Guidance Programmes in terms of safeguarding the future of the Community fishing fleets. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight certain issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, with regard to the requirements in terms of measurement – one of the key issues when ascertaining actual compliance with the MAGPs by the different Member States – although it is true that we have still not achieved total harmonisation of the units of measurement on passing from one system to another, the Commission is working on it and has implemented different initiatives. Amongst other initiatives, it has requested an exhaustive report from an external body with expertise in this area, Seafish Industries Authorities, which has visited the competent authorities in the different States in order to study appropriate ways to harmonise these measurements.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the basis of this report, as well as reports and other works carried out by the Community’s own inspectors, the Commission will draw up, as necessary, a proposed review of the regulation on measurement, that is to say, a proposed review of the transfer from MAGP III to MAGP IV.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to add that the Commission is collaborating with the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) in order to determine how to also establish a common regulation for the measurement of engine power, another key element in ascertaining the capacity of fishing capability of each of the respective fleets.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having studied how to improve both the definition of the MAGP and the measurements regarding the capacities of each fleet, we come to the crux of the matter: control of the degree of compliance with the multiannual programmes and control of the compliance with what the Council agrees on the proposal of the Commission. The Commission is not satisfied with the way this question is developing and, although advances have been made, not everything that the Commission proposed at the time has been done.</p>
      <p sl="es">Advances have been made insofar as the suspension of public aid is an effective instrument, at least with regard to a certain Member State, which has changed its attitude and which has begun to provide more information. Therefore, progress is being made in terms of greater compliance with the multiannual programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">The new structural policy on the fishing industry for 2000-2006 clearly includes provisions in the field of penalties which will provide the Commission – once and for all – with the means to make stricter demands with regard to compliance with the objectives of the different MAGPs on the part of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Please allow me to point out, to those of you who have expressed dissatisfaction on the grounds that the penalties approved are insufficient, that this has not been due to a lack of will on the part of the Commission. The Commission had proposed additional penalties and the Council rejected them. These included additional penalties such as denying the opportunity to use new fishing grounds in third countries, financed by means of Community funds, being imposed on countries who do not fully comply with the MAGPs. This measure, which would have been very effective, was rejected by the Council. Therefore, it is not the Commission which does not want to make provision for more effective methods of achieving greater compliance, rather the Council. Of course, the Commission is prepared to continue moving forward on this issue and what is required is a similar resolve on the part of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the controversial proposal contained in paragraph 6, I have to say that it raises certain problems from a legal point of view. It is true that, being a purely temporary suspension, it may perhaps be considered. However, there are other types of system and the Council has not wanted to adopt them either. Frankly, we doubt that the Council will change its mind and accept a proposal of this type. If it changes its position, these or other proposals will be welcome. Proposals would be presented because the Commission has already done so and it has been the Council which has rejected them.</p>
      <p sl="es">We clearly have to remember that penalties, in the end, often harm the producers themselves. If we draw a parallel between agriculture and fisheries – which we obviously can – certain types of penalties end up affecting farmers, whose income is eventually reduced. The reduction of a fleet in a particular country obviously means a sacrifice on the part of seafaring and coastal populations, who are affected by that reduction. Certain types of activity have social effects and it therefore falls to the Member States – and the Community, where appropriate – to adopt supplementary measures to deal with these effects.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is in terms of compliance with the MAGPs and, above all, fishing quotas, and the rational management of fishing resources, that we really hold the future of the European fishing industry in our hands.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Cunha once again on his report, and I repeat that, with regard to compliance and penalties, the Commission has made positive proposals while others have not wanted them and, of course, the Commission will continue to try to bring about greater compliance with all the obligations on the part of all Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="4-050" speaker_id="1264" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0102/1999) by Mr Turmes, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on energy efficiency requirements for ballasts for fluorescent lighting [COM(1999)296 – C5-0010/1999 – 1999/0127(COD)].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-051" speaker_id="4432" name="Turmes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, why do we need a European directive on efficiency for fluorescent lighting? We use 130 million such lights in the 15 Member States of the EU every year, especially in office buildings, where two-thirds of the light is currently provided by fluorescent lighting. Following on from the Rio Conference in 1992, the EU Commission carried out a study into what specific steps could be introduced in our countries in order to protect the climate. It emerged that one of the cheapest measures in the EU would be to increase the efficiency of fluorescent lighting. These lights are on for ten hours a day, five to seven days a week, 50 weeks of the year for several years, meaning that even a slight improvement in efficiency of just three or five watts would make a huge difference to energy consumption over the years. The EU Commission started negotiations with CELMA, the association which represents manufacturers of lighting systems and, in 1996, it drafted a study in order to have a scientific basis for a decision. This 1996 study took account of several scenarios. The most efficient scenario, where all magnetic ballasts would be withdrawn at some point from the market and the best available technology, i.e. electronic ballasts, which already account for 20% of the market, would, at some point, supply the entire market, would mean savings of 250 terawatt hours, i.e. 250 billion kilowatt hours throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am from Luxembourg. The entire consumption of electricity in Luxembourg, for industry, residential customers and office buildings, is 6 terawatt hours per annum. In other words, this directive would enable us to save twice the entire electricity consumption of Luxembourg. In other words, it is not quite as irrelevant as it might appear at first glance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission presented a proposal in 1999. This proposal falls below the minimum scenario in the study which it itself commissioned in 1996. That is because not all magnetic ballasts will be phased out consistently; some would remain on the market, and we would save 100 billion kilowatt hours less over coming years. Parliament therefore needs to improve the Commission’s proposal. There are ecological arguments which I have already mentioned. There is also a technical and financial argument. The industry itself has tried to use the Commission’s present paper to estimate what investment signals are being given to the ballast market. It has ascertained that, in 5-8 years’ time, 50% of ballasts would be the best magnetic ballasts, i.e. we are actually sending the market the wrong signal. Instead of ensuring that all investments are channelled into the best available technology, i.e. electronic ballasts, a large part of the investments would only go to the second best technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">So it is not hard to imagine that, if the industry invests in the second best technology over the next 3-4 years, it will object even more in 5-6 years, when we undertake a review, than it does today to reversing investments which it has only just made.</p>
      <p sl="de">A word on the international background: the USA plans to phase out all magnetic ballasts by 2010. Our proposal, and here I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other parties, Mrs McNally, Mr Rovsing and Mr Beysen, would simply be adopting what is already on the agenda in the USA.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-052" speaker_id="1269" name="Rovsing" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would thank the rapporteur for the proposal, with which I completely agree. I am also grateful for the constructive cooperation between the Groups, in which we have reached compromises I find to be responsible, apposite and to the point. We therefore support these in our Group.</p>
      <p sl="da">Why are we concerning ourselves with this issue? To put it very briefly, it is a question of limiting man-made carbon dioxide emissions. We know that, as Asia obtains a higher standard of living, 1.4 billion Chinese and 1 billion Indians will begin to use more and more energy, and this means that, when they begin to demand ordinary basic comforts such as warm water and perhaps air conditioning, means of transport and modern industry, their consumption of energy will rise dramatically from its present figure of 10% of the EU’s average energy consumption. In Rio, we undertook to protect the climate. The present document completely fulfils this purpose. We note that, of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, 30% come from electricity generation and 35% of all energy used in the EU is obtained from electricity.</p>
      <p sl="da">In the EU, strip lights account for 53% of electricity used for lighting and, if we succeed in implementing what we have planned, we shall, by the year 2020, be preventing six million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. We shall conserve 10% of the electricity consumed by strip lighting and, converted into cash, this will be a saving of EUR 250 million per year. The present proposal will therefore have quite a significant impact on the climate and on the economy and, by implementing it as suggested, we shall be giving our industry a long time in which to make the changeover. Mr Turmes was in favour of this, and I would remind you that industry has, in any case, known since 1992 that, by approximately the year 2009, magnetic ballasts would be more or less prohibited. There is therefore nothing new in what we are doing.</p>
      <p sl="da">In the compromise we have prepared, we have been united on the issue of increasing energy efficiency. We wished to protect the climate. We wished to achieve economic advantages, and we wished to be sure that, in phasing out certain uses of energy, we did not unnecessarily burden ordinary consumers in ordinary homes with making investments on which there can be no return. At the same time, we have ensured that we in the northern part of the Union – in northern Finland, northern Sweden, northern Norway, Greenland and other places – where electronic ballasts are no use, may continue to use magnetic ballasts. This is, all in all, a splendid proposal, and I recommend that we all give it our backing and support in the form in which it was agreed in the Groups.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am glad that this debate is proving educational and enlightening for you. Sometimes debates are not exciting; it is much more interesting to talk about dramatic weather conditions and storms in France. But if we want to stop events like that, this is the sort of detailed technical work we have to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to congratulate Mr Turmes for his very thorough work, his technical expertise and his willingness to engage in proper discussions on compromise with Members from other groups. That is appreciated, and I think it is the responsible way we should work in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we take our Kyoto and other obligations seriously and want to prevent tragic weather events, we have to work with some sense of urgency. It is eight years since negotiations with the industry concerned and with energy experts began, on ways in which we could use the lighting sector to save electricity. There are many reasons for doing that. It is an extremely sensible investment for businesses within the European Union to have energy efficient lighting.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to have an internal market without unjustified, obstructive trade barriers. Our enterprises throughout the single market have to work in the same conditions; there has to be the famous level playing-field, always bearing in mind particular national concerns and circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Electricity, the Commission reminds us, accounts for 35% of our total primary energy use and produces 30% of our man-made carbon dioxide emissions. Tackling that sector, as well as the transport sector, is essential. It is very appropriate therefore that we look at minimum efficiency standards in any area which uses electricity. We have looked successfully at domestic boilers and industrial boilers, at fridges and freezers and we have some voluntary agreements – about which I might have reservations – in other household appliance sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I can quote from a study carried out in the United Kingdom at our very well known Building Research Centre: "the production of performance standards, particularly for fluorescent lamp ballasts, appears from this study to be one of the most effective actions which the EC could take to reduce energy consumption for lighting in commercial buildings and is thus worth further consideration and development." That very highly esteemed research establishment decided this was a sector we should work on.</p>
      <p sl="en">One problem is that those who buy lights are not necessarily those who use them. Those who invest in buildings are not the people who will pay the electricity bills in future years. The huge numbers of lights, however, mean that we have to look to ensure that those purchasers have to make sensible purchases, by ensuring that what is on the market meets the highest possible standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are only talking of newly produced fluorescent lighting ballasts. We are not suggesting that every single one has to be replaced tomorrow or next week. That would be an absurd way to carry on. We are suggesting that, in a very phased, measured and well-considered way, as the current lights in use are replaced, over the next 15-20 years, they are replaced with the best possible technology. A very long adaptation period, that is how we work in the European Union. We do not jump on our enterprises with surprise packages about which they have no warning and which would cause them considerable difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Turmes has indeed been reasonable. The 800 people employed in manufacturing magnetic ballasts will not lose their jobs next week. There will be plenty of time for a phase-in period.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in the Socialist Group are against the additional amendments which have been submitted. They are not in line with the aims of the report. But we support those amendments which we signed as part of the compromise, many of which add, as I am sure the Commissioner would agree, sensible definitions. I hope the Commissioner will tell us that this is only part of her aim to increase energy efficiency within the European Union and make our promises more than mere political headlines.</p>

    <intervention id="4-054" speaker_id="4752" name="Beysen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, the present report which Mr Turmes has drafted with great care, seems to concern a technical matter at first glance. To my mind, however, this report has a far greater scope, as has been, in fact, already highlighted by the Members. On the one hand, it is the first report of the new millennium that will contribute to the more economical use of energy, and nobody will dispute the fact that our planet’s chances of survival in this new millennium will largely depend on how we handle energy in future. This is why one cannot afford to gloss over this initiative. On the other hand, I am of the opinion that the way in which this report came about, following consultation with the industry involved, as well as politicians and the Commission, is a good example of what the French would term ‘cohabitation’ . By this, I mean that the deliberations and round-table discussions which preceded the draft directive have led to a consensus between industry and the Commission. The report, as it is now presented, is also the result of compromise amendments approved by the key political groups and I subscribe to what the previous speaker, Mrs McNally, has said, that it is a working method which should be applied more often in future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The compromise amendments make particular provision for long transitional periods. What it comes down to is that industry has nearly ten years left in order to carry out the necessary adjustments. Moreover, add to this the fact that industry has been aware that changes were inevitable since 1992. It is also interesting to know that the magnetic pre-selection device will not have to be phased out completely until 2009. The importance of this report, Mr President, lies in the fact that it highlights the significant impact this directive has on the employment of thousands of employees, as well as concerns regarding distorting competition policy. Indeed, if the transitional periods were too short, it is clear that not only an entire production line would be at risk, but also the manufacturer, as the latter would not be able to adapt the production line in time. Needless to say, it is our aim to consult all parties involved in the implementation of this report on a regular basis, so that those who have so far opposed the phasing out of the pre-selection device are given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the development process. By weighing up the different interests and by working together closely with different interested parties, Parliament has succeeded in delivering a clear and well-founded piece of legislation. I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Turmes.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-055" speaker_id="2304" name="Seppänen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we are discussing a report on a very technical subject, but it is of immense importance, both for energy conservation and, furthermore, for employment in Europe. The rapporteur has worked hard to discover the effects of energy policies in the report but, at the same time, has paid insufficient attention to the fact that if the recommendations in the report were adopted the result for Europe would be unemployment, mostly in Germany, but also in Finland, Austria, Italy and Spain.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Fluorescent lighting uses two types of reactor, which have an effect on energy efficiency. Magnetic reactors produce a lot of light and heat. In northern countries this heat conserves heat energy and is not just wasted. Electronic reactors produce more light and less heat, and they are clearly superior to magnetic reactors from the point of view of energy efficiency. Theirs will be the future if they can be made as economically competitive as magnetic reactors.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Philips has certainly quite rightly invested in this sort of technology. Its products, however, should not be the only ones to be recognised as European standards through political pressure. Mr Turmes in his report proposes banning magnetic reactors in fluorescent lighting, unlike the Commission or the Council. If the report were adopted, Parliament’s position would destroy the industry as far as Europe is concerned. Elsewhere in the world they would certainly manufacture and use magnetic reactors, which are necessary in the sort of natural environment that I come from. Only magnetic reactors can be used in the cold and damp. The production of magnetic reactors would move from Europe to the developing countries, as a result of the ban. The USA has already experienced this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If we want to keep jobs in Europe, Mr Turmes’ report cannot be adopted with regard to the amendments made by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza. The production costs relating to electronic reactors are many times those of the magnetic ones, and the conservation of nature should also be examined from the point of view of the use and recycling of materials.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am the speaker for the TDI Group, even if I am speaking on behalf of just one of its component parts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are dealing with the matter of ballast in fluorescent tubes. Now what does this actually mean? The electric current in fluorescent lamps, such as those providing the lighting above our heads, is regulated and stabilised by small devices called ballasts. For fifty years, these ballasts have been made from a copper coil in a sheet metal box. They are called “ferromagnetic ballasts”. Nowadays, however, we have electronic ballasts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The traditional ferromagnetic ballasts are said to entail a certain loss of energy, particularly due to resistance. The loss would be up to 8 watts an hour, whereas the electronic ones would lose only 3 watts. They would therefore allow for a saving of 5 watts and, multiplying that by 130 million ballasts, you would save millions of tonnes of energy, there would be less CO2, the greenhouse effect would be reduced and mankind would breathe more easily. Consequently, in eight years time, we would have to abandon ferromagnetic ballasts in favour of electronic ballasts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, Mr Turmes does not tell us that the electronic ballast has a shorter service life than the ferromagnetic one. Therefore, more of them will have to be manufactured, with more energy consumed and the savings just mentioned will partly disappear. Furthermore, these electronic ballasts are made with transistors that contain heavy metals, such as tantalum, germanium, and even arsenic, not to mention plastic, that is to say, non-biodegradable pollutants, whereas the copper and sheet metal of the ferromagnetic ballasts are biodegradable. In other words, for a saving of energy that is not as clear cut as it seems, our Green colleagues are prepared to release heavy metals and arsenic into the environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, in addition to increasing pollution, unemployment will increase because the components used in the manufacture of the electronic ballasts and the machines that make them are not European. So, in order to avoid import costs, our manufacturers are going to relocate and thus reduce the number of jobs. In the final analysis, in wishing to make a modest saving of energy by using electronic ballasts, at a time when our manufacturers are demanding simply a gradual and selective ban, what we have at best is a saving but also the release of pollutants and increased unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nor are we tackling the real problem of waste, that is to say, incandescent lamps that show losses of up to 50 watts in comparison with fluorescent lamps. But it is true that incandescent lamps are manufactured by two multinationals, Philips and Osram. And so maybe there is a connection between the internationalists of the European Commission, the internationalists of the nebulous green multinational and the transnationals of industry, but I am not asking that we shed light on the whole business.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-057" speaker_id="2278" name="Rübig" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I only have to look up to see that we are surrounded by numerous ballasts. I think that this chamber is a model of how neon tubes and ballasts can work together. I am sure that we have the economical bulbs because it has also been proven that electronic ballasts pay for themselves within one to two years. We therefore have a very good return on investment, which is why all modern building constructors and planners are already changing over to these electronic ballasts. At the moment, the market cannot produce enough ballasts to meet requirements.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main problem is that the technology is so modern and attractive that, in truth, the industry cannot manufacture the quantities required in the immediate future. This, of course, presents a problem because we must ensure that the ballasts are available at the right time when we pass our regulation, otherwise there will be a certain shortage. If it is no longer possible to manufacture the magnetic ballasts and there are not enough electronic ballasts available, then the market may encounter difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, I am in favour of a legislative regulation, despite the fact that I have considered long and hard as to whether a European directive for ballasts does, in fact, make sense. I am in favour, however, because I believe that we should invest more research in this technology in the future. We should make an effort to ensure that future investments are channelled into electronic ballasts. This is already self-evident from the market itself, but I think that this directive could act as an incentive to invest more funds more quickly and achieve a solid return.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-058" speaker_id="997" name="Speroni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, the previous speakers certainly displayed their expertise on the extremely technical subject of ballasts for fluorescent lighting. Nevertheless, I feel that the debate has not been followed very closely, and I wonder how many of the Members will be able to vote with any understanding of the subject, given that a person’s general knowledge – accumulated through studies, everyday life or even the political life of a Member of Parliament – is unlikely to stretch to a thorough understanding of ballasts for fluorescent lighting. I wonder, therefore, whether these subjects need to be discussed in the House, or whether it would be better, making full use of the regulatory provisions, to restrict these debates to the committees. The highly technical nature of some subjects prevents us understanding what we are voting on, although, of course, we could always stay with the customary crosses and dashes on the voting lists that are prepared by someone else. But this would debase our job! We wonder, moreover, if it is necessary for Parliament to address such complex and highly technical issues, or whether it would be better, as is the case with national regulations, to give responsibility for these subjects to other bodies, considering – and we heard this from the previous speakers – that they have minimal political implications.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, I would like to make a remark about so-called clean energy, which I do not think many Members took in. It is not true that electrical energy is clean energy: obviously, if I heat my house in the town with electric radiators rather than water radiators powered by a naphtha heater, there will be less pollution in the town, but if we consider, as the report says, that in any case 30% of the CO2 in the atmosphere comes from electricity production, perhaps it would be appropriate for the public to revise their knowledge and convictions and, above all, for clearer information to be provided regarding what actually is clean energy and what is not.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-059" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="De Palacio" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, on his excellent report and I would also like to thank all the speakers and Parliament for the broad support which they have lent to this proposal, which the Commission believes could contribute significantly to increasing energy efficiency, and whose main objective is to achieve a saving of 20% in the consumption of electricity in the tertiary sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of this is necessary to achieve a substantial improvement in efficiency in the end use of electricity, thereby complying with our Kyoto commitments.</p>
      <p sl="es">The proposal takes a cautious approach aimed at improving energy efficiency while not imposing an excessive burden on the manufacturers of ballasts. I would like to point out, as some speakers have highlighted, that the sector involved was consulted before this proposal was drawn up.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have a proposal which works in different stages. The first stage, which will be effective as of one year following adoption of the directive, will involve the progressive elimination of low efficiency ballasts. A second stage of more demanding regulations will then progressively reduce the number of conventional ballasts, making obligatory the use of high performance, high efficiency ballasts.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must point out – in order to illustrate the change which this implies – that, currently, conventional ballasts make up approximately two thirds of total current sales, which means that this second stage will have very significant effects and will no doubt have repercussions for the industry. We therefore propose a transitional period of four years.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the amendments proposed, I am pleased to tell you that the Commission can accept all of those presented by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, with the exception of Amendments Nos 1, 17, 19 and 20, on the automatic introduction of a third stage of efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission agrees that it is necessary to take a dynamic approach and therefore the proposal lays down the possibility of a third stage. Nevertheless, we believe that it would be difficult to establish all the characteristics of this third stage at the moment. In our opinion, it is preferable to evaluate the technical and economic situation at the moment of the entry into force of the second stage and determine, by consulting the parties involved at that moment, whether to carry out the third stage, how it should be carried out, what the technical definitions should be, which requirements should be laid down and within what time scale it can be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="es">Consequently, the Commission can also accept the second part of Amendment No 23, but not the first part. In the same way, the Commission can also accept part of Amendment No 1, with a different wording. Furthermore, we also agree with Amendment No 12 in order that the Member States may carry out effective application.</p>
      <p sl="es">The amendments aimed at clarifying the fact that all ballasts sold as independent components or incorporated into lamps are covered by the proposal, that is to say, Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 21 and 22, as I have said, are all acceptable to the Commission. Amendment No 2 is also acceptable, since the Commission agrees with the exclusion of the types of ballasts mentioned, as are Amendments Nos 15 and 16, which extend the transitional period to 18 months. Finally, the Commission accepts Amendment No 8 on the promotion of efficiency regulations at international forums.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I have summarised the Commission’s position with regard to the report. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, once again, on his excellent work and I trust that the Council can adopt a common position which will allow this question to be speedily resolved.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted as representative of the Pensioners’ Party for the measure on energy efficiency requirements for ballasts for fluorescent lighting, although I did vote for some amendments that were not adopted by the House. I am certainly in favour of saving energy and, in fact, for some time now, I have been reading the reports I am to debate in the European Parliament in the evenings by candlelight in order to make my humble contribution to saving energy. Yes, we do need to save energy, but we also need to have enough common sense to realise that this must not entail the total curtailment of the activities which provide employment for Europe’s citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="4-072" speaker_id="1018" name="Wurtz" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="fr">The proposal for a Commission directive on ballasts for fluorescent lighting aims to improve their efficiency and to reduce the consumption of energy. It proposes that measures be implemented gradually and in a well-balanced manner.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By adopting numerous amendments, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is not respecting this balance, as it wants to abolish the manufacture and marketing of ferromagnetic ballasts in favour of electronic ballasts exclusively. This radical approach does not take account of all the technical and scientific arguments, in terms of either energy savings or technological progress. It seems to ignore, for example, that there are ferromagnetic ballasts with low energy consumption on the market. What is much more serious is the fact that the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy completely ignores the effects of its proposals on jobs. Curtailing the manufacture of ferromagnetic ballasts would be likely to involve the closure of many production sites and many redundancies, such as the Vossloh-Schwabe factory in Colmar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I voted against the final report after the adoption of many amendments whose implementation would be very dangerous for jobs in this sector. I would appeal to the Council to reject the amendments that have just been adopted.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The coastal areas of the West of France are now polluted due to the wreck of the Erika.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everyone knows that the more time that passes, the greater the risk of such a dreadful incident recurring. In fact, the American legislation adopted in 1990, after the Exxon Valdez ran aground on the coast of Alaska, prohibits oil tankers that do not meet the consolidated and strictly controlled safety criteria from having access to American ports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The inevitable result is that oil tankers that do not meet these criteria will be forced, increasingly, into European waters, thereby increasing the likelihood of pollution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament should therefore, as an urgent priority, study these problems and immediately obtain an undertaking, firstly from the Commission, and then from the governments of the Member States, that they will establish a body of rules designed to protect marine and tourist activities along the coasts of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is essential for an operational European Maritime Agency to be set up immediately, whose main aim would be to coordinate the safety checks carried out on oil tankers using European ports in accordance with standardised methods.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I feel compelled to make some comments regarding the storm that struck Europe and, more especially, France.</p>
      <p sl="fr">1 – Although a direct link has not definitely been established between this storm, the greenhouse effect and pollution, these events are, at the very least, a warning of what will happen to us in future if we continue to pollute the atmosphere of our planet so thoughtlessly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">2 – If buildings have been constructed “on the cheap”, in Europe too, and if there has been a preference for overhead electricity networks, often very ugly visually, we are now counting the real, onerous cost of these false economies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">3 – In the measures undertaken to repair the storm damage, we have seen both our weaknesses, our lack of resources and, at the same time, the great solidarity that has emerged and the equally great importance of the concept of “public service” in some of our public companies that are often given a rough time by the dominant ultra-liberal ideology.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to salute all the staff of the companies who have worked relentlessly and selflessly to restore services, to re-establish electricity and telephone lines and to rehouse families affected by the disaster.</p>
      <p sl="fr">4 – Finally, if it wants to remain or be close to its citizens, Europe must provide significant financial assistance!</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States, which are often over-cautious, should provide Europe with the financial means necessary.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-077" speaker_id="1474" name="Desama" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="fr">The problem of the storms that have affected various European countries shows the vulnerability of our society, otherwise characterised by its economic and technological development. We realise that we are not shielded from the dreadful consequences that can be caused by climatic disasters such as floods, earthquakes or tidal waves. Some countries have been able to provide a solution to the problem of compensating the victims of such events. France is one of these, but it is a large country with considerable resources. This is not the case in smaller countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Belgium, a scheme to compensate the victims of natural disasters has been in preparation for 10 years. It is at European level that the various schemes have encountered problems. First of all, whereas, before the internal market was established, it was possible to impose prices and exemptions, this is no longer the case and that seems to me quite natural. On the other hand, it is more difficult to accept that it is not possible to make provision for the creation of a mutual reinsurance fund with which the companies operating on the Belgian market would be obliged to insure themselves. Then the guarantee of the State could come into play only if the system had exhausted all its funds (in the event of a major disaster).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now we have a priority: to offer disaster victims a full, unlimited, guarantee. Fate has already dealt them a cruel hand without them being responsible, so should they be disadvantaged further by inadequate insurance cover? Here, the guarantee of the State is essential, as no traditional reinsurer offers unlimited conditions. This is the only way to maintain a reasonable price for the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The appeal to traditional reinsurance will have a regulatory effect at international level, which means that insured parties in Belgium will pay for the hurricanes somewhere in Central America. The idea is not to undo the effects of solidarity, but to organise a fair system that is protected from market forces alone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add that it is the only way for the State to have a guarantee that the system acts in the general interest, by keeping an eye on the build up and use of the technical reserves. If this “right of inspection” is not authorised, the State will never agree to give its guarantee. A controlled reinsurance mechanism is the only thing that will make it possible to avoid risks being selected by the natural laws of the market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If a national solidarity mechanism is not guaranteed by a system that departs, even temporarily, from the laws of the market, bad risks will be excluded, whereas it is precisely those risks that we are trying to protect (for example, houses built on river banks). That is why I raise the issue of a derogation from European law, from the standard law of competition. It is, moreover, a concept that is in accordance with the Treaty. Article 87(2) authorises State aid “to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences.”</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is far from unlikely that such disasters will recur. Solutions should be found to finance the compensation of victims of natural disasters. A departure from the law of competition, temporarily, would form a hope of resolving this harrowing problem in a country like Belgium.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I did of course vote in favour of the resolutions on the storms and the oil slick and I should like to express my heartfelt sympathy for the people stricken by these disasters. I am thinking in particular, with great warmth, of the inhabitants of my own region, Champagne-Ardennes, who suffered greatly from these storms in December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I deplore the further consequences which this oil slick may have for the communities on the Atlantic coast.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed I am concerned about what chance the marinas and local communities still have of obtaining the Blue Flag 2000. For twenty years the European Blue Flag has been testimony to the considerable efforts made by municipalities to promote economic development that respects the environment. Around fifty municipalities in the five French departments affected by the oil slick are involved in Blue Flag 2000 schemes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also concerned at the rumours regarding a request to postpone awarding blue flags to French beaches on the Atlantic coast. What then of the loss of reputation suffered by these beaches and the injustice, when some municipalities would no longer have the flag but others would? Should there be a decision to award the blue flag to a few municipalities in order to enhance the reputation of the whole coast as a tourist area, or not award it to any of them to ensure fair treatment all round?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I call upon Member States and the European Union to relieve the problems arising as a result of these disasters by means of long-term financial aid, certainly, but also by means of ‘moral support’ (these resolutions play their part in this) for the people so seriously affected by the polluted beaches, the uprooted trees, the flattened and indeed devastated forests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is important is the time factor, for we are not talking short term here, like the multinationals, but rather in terms of centuries for the reforestation of France. That should give us a lesson in humility.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I have already given notice that I want to give an explanation of vote concerning the resolution on the Middle East peace process. The European Parliament has previously expressed its support for a Palestinian state and reiterates this in paragraphs 2 and 3 of today’s resolution.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I consider that the European Union can contribute to a lasting peace in the Middle East, ultimately based upon democracy, political pluralism, respect for human rights, the independence of the judiciary and a social and ecological market economy. This can happen through the EU acting in such a way that it inspires more faith and confidence than it does today among the population in Israel, the Middle East’s only democracy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">To mention, therefore, in paragraphs 2 and 3, the question of the possible foundation of a Palestinian state does not contribute to the process of creating confidence in this way. American political leaders have never come out in favour of a Palestinian state but, at the same time, have a lot of credibility in the region as peace brokers with constructive contributions to make.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The European Union could also take on such a role. Today’s statement about a Palestinian state does not increase the possibility of the EU being able to do this in the future. I have therefore abstained from voting in the final vote.</p>

      <p sl="en">Recent events in Tel Aviv show that the paths to peace, unlike those of Divine Providence, are not, alas, infinite in number. They can be blocked and thrown into chaos by terrorist attacks, they can become strewn with innocent victims and they can curtail or slow the efforts of those well-meaning people, on both sides, who sincerely want peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Sharm el-Sheikh agreements and the Shepherdstown negotiations prove that, despite initial difficulties and differences, compromises can be achieved in the direction of peace, although peace is unfortunately not yet in sight. It is hidden by the smoke screen of terrorist attacks, it is sabotaged by terrorism, and it is pushed further away by all kinds of fundamentalism, which are always and, in any case, enemies of stability and security, and security is an essential factor for success: without security there can be no peace, and without peace in the Middle East the Mediterranean will be an insecure area where anything could happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">The attitude of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Barak, is, however, understandable. He proposed to the Palestinian leader, Mr Arafat, to put back by a month or two the deadline set at 13 February for the conclusion of a broad agreement on the main points of the future permanent status of the Palestinian territories that have been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Also, the postponement of the third round of peace talks between Israel and Syria adds to the uncertain climate caused by the absence of guaranteed security.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, our opinion is that the establishment of a new border between Israel and Syria, which anticipates a peaceful solution of the Golan Heights question and takes into account the security requirements of both countries, is an essential condition for the creation of new peaceful relations between the peoples concerned and for the aversion of the risks of fresh terrorist attacks and the ensuing violence. It is in the interests of the whole Mediterranean region for Israel and Syria to reach new peace agreements, and this would be a major contribution to the establishment of a new stability in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, we are convinced that there are also those who work against stability and security, sometimes with unspeakable ferocity. They are the real enemies of peace. They use all possible means to destabilise governments and create disorder. They are there in areas where there is tension, or rather, they sometimes cause it deliberately in an attempt to end negotiations or stir up emotions among the public, thereby putting pressure on the governments. Europe must find the courage to expose these elements and to put itself forward, not only as a mediator or advisor at diplomatic level in the peace process, but also as an authoritative, strong partner in dialogue with the enemies of peace. It is unthinkable for violence and terrorist attacks to always cast a pall over international relations. Terrorism – because this is what it is – must be denounced and fought relentlessly. We are there for our Israeli friends every time they are struck by blind, despicable terrorism, but we must also be increasingly effective against those who arm the terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="en">While it is impossible for there to be an infinite number of paths to peace, we must ensure that there are, at least, an infinite number of paths which will allow us to stop and eradicate the dealers in death, the real enemies of peace.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the European Parliament resolution on international capital movements, that we have just rejected, dealt with a very broad and very interesting subject, but unfortunately dealt with it superficially and in a slapdash way. Frankly, the subject deserved better.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After some disjointed considerations, the resolution revealed its real purpose in paragraph 9, which was to request that the Commission should, within six months, draw up a report on the interest and feasibility of a tax on international speculative capital movements. If you approach the subject from this angle, I am sorry to say that there were no grounds for the report requested. Everyone already knows that it is impossible. In fact, it is completely impossible to distinguish a speculative capital movement from a non-speculative movement, except by using arbitrary bureaucratic criteria that would distort trade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">And when would you get to the point where you have to distinguish the good speculations, those that aim to challenge the artificial situations to take better account of the real economy, from the bad speculations, those of which it is declared (also arbitrarily) that they essentially aim to harm others? This exercise would be even more impossible than the previous one. In short, the European Parliament’s resolution in this form completely missed the point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the question could have been expressed differently. It could have asked whether it were appropriate to introduce a tax on all international capital movements, of whatever type, without embarking on impossible distinctions. This is a more sensible question but, again, this question was not raised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To the second question, however, I would reply that such a standard tax would probably not resolve the monetary crises that most often correspond to real underlying imbalances. Instead of creating a new tax, to be paid into who knows what fund, it would be better to ensure sound economic policies and to reduce existing taxes and contributions, particularly on income.</p>

      <p sl="el">I welcome the fact that the subject of a tax on international movements of capital has, at last, been tabled before the European Parliament for discussion and decision. It was an initiative adopted by our Group, the Group of the European United Left, which was then supported by other Groups.</p>
      <p sl="el">One only has to think that transactions on the world stock markets total USD 1 800 billion a day and that the annual trade in goods and services is in the order of USD 6 000 billion, i.e. four days’ speculation on the stock exchange, in order to realise just how serious the problem is. President Delors was right when he likened the world economy to a casino and the fact that the parliaments of Finland and Canada and UNCTAD are in favour of a capital tax is a positive sign.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission needs to propose a Tobin type tax on short-term movements of speculative capital and the Portuguese and French Presidencies need to make this issue one of their priorities. A low but graduated tax of this type must be configured so that it does not cause negative repercussions on the real economy, i.e. trade and investment, and so that it allows resources to be safeguarded for education, the environment and development.</p>
      <p sl="el">This measure should be the first step towards regulatory and fiscal measures to deal with the phenomenon of massive international speculation.</p>

      <p sl="da">We have voted in favour of the compromise proposal, given that it clearly has the right intentions behind it. It must, however, at the same time be pointed out that it is crucially important that the debate surrounding the introduction of a possible Tobin tax should take place on a worldwide basis in international and national forums and without, as a side-effect, increasing the EU’s powers at the expense of those of the aforementioned forums.</p>

    <intervention id="4-085" speaker_id="4297" name="Fruteau" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="fr">Our economic system has shown its limitations. The financial sector is not in phase with the real economy and too often upsets it. Our high rates of unemployment, the marked increase in the gap between North and South and the increase in poverty on a worldwide scale are evidence of this sad reality. International capital movements are destabilising factors. That is why we must seek measures to tax transactions on the foreign exchange markets in order to reduce their volatility and to curb short-term speculative transactions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that a tax such as that envisaged by James Tobin, the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Economics, would represent a tiny blip in the excessively well-oiled machinery of speculation and the considerable amounts of money that it could generate are valid arguments in favour of its implementation, especially when you realise that even by adopting a very low rate (about 0.05%), it would bring in almost FRF 600 billion per year, according to the most conservative estimates!</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) proposes that this sum be paid back to the states where the tax would be collected and to a redistribution fund for the poorest countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The wealth recovered in this way from the large international capitalists would be redirected to the people and could form a considerable lever to achieve development for the poorest countries. We would finally have arrived at a situation where solidarity took the place of selfishness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For all these reasons I voted in favour of this resolution and I am very pleased that the House has now dealt with this subject, at the risk of annoying the unscrupulous speculators whose actions destabilise the most vulnerable economies, and sometimes even our whole system, as can be seen from the recent financial crises in south-east Asia.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We have voted in favour of the request to place on the agenda a debate on the Tobin tax because we are convinced that its application, even on a limited basis, in Europe would be a first step towards greater social justice and towards a redistribution of wealth. We nevertheless are under no illusions that this tax, alone, could remove the very causes of poverty which are associated with the economic and financial system that dominates the planet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are voting for everything that is associated with the request to the Commission to examine the feasibility of the Tobin tax. However, we are not voting for the recitals of the compromise resolution, tabled by the Socialists, the European United Left, the Greens and the Liberals, who aim to defend and regulate the dominant economic system and “to ensure the operation of the globalised financial markets, even rid of their excesses.”</p>

      <p sl="fr">The representatives of Lutte Ouvrière will vote against the compromise resolution on tax on capital movements. This resolution, on the ridiculous and Utopian pretext of ‘stabilising’ the international financial system and ‘ridding’ it of its excesses, maintains, above all, that its aim is to safeguard it. Our view is that mankind should be rid not only of the excesses of the world financial system, but of the financial system itself and the capitalist organisation of the economy, of which it is one of the essential components.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not only short-term capital speculation on the financial markets that represents an enormous material, social and human waste for society, but capital itself. Looking at the current redundancies and axing of jobs, from Michelin to Alsthom, which virtually all large companies (despite the fact that they benefit from Europe) are making with the sole aim of increasing their share price rise: is this speculation or the normal activity of capital?</p>
      <p sl="fr">If a resolution clearly proposed the introduction of the Tobin tax, we would not have voted against it, so our vote should not be confused with those of the smug admirers of the capitalist system who are offended by any tax on almighty capital. For our part, the political objective that we propose to the working classes is that they impose very heavy taxes, not only on speculative capital, but also on the profits of all the large capitalist companies and on the private fortunes of the wealthy, so that the money thus concentrated in the hands of the State can serve to create useful jobs in the public sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ridiculous Tobin tax is, however, certainly not a measure of social justice. It would not even hamper the speculators and, instead of obstructing the waste and injustices of the capitalist economy, it would only serve to conceal them.</p>

I abstained on paragraph 4 because a superficial diagnosis of a very complex problem does not seem appropriate in any respect and on paragraph 8 because this advocated immediate measures against offshore centres. In the absence of a global and balanced framework, this would hurt Portugal because of the current offshore centre in Madeira.

It is right for there to be penalties for those who do not implement the guidelines, but I must also say that, following my speech in this House regarding the explanation of vote on Friday 17 December 1999, that is, last century, the fish got wind of this and, in writing – because as we all know, they cannot talk – said to me: “Well done, you spoke up for us! Speak up again for us young fish, especially seeing as you are a young fish yourself, but also speak up for the elderly fish who would like to live longer and who are therefore in favour of limiting fishing where the guidelines are breached.” They also asked me – but I will do this another time – to put forward their proposals on fishing nets so that they can live longer and become pensioners as well.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in line with the stance of the Portuguese Popular Party, the CDS-PP, on this subject. Firstly, we are highly critical of the common fisheries policy which has caused so much damage to Portuguese fishing and fishermen. We particularly distrust the actions of Commissioner Fischler. Secondly, we agree with the position taken by the Cunha report which asks the Commission to establish effective monitoring and inspection measures. By not properly penalising countries in breach of the rules, the Commission is discriminating against countries which do comply, such as Portugal. I therefore voted in favour of the first and last parts of paragraph 6 but abstained on the middle parts which advocated a specific penalty. This financial penalty would have been premature without an adequate legal basis and would have been out of proportion in the second situation of a simple administrative infringement. I also abstained in the final vote because these middle parts were adopted and because paragraph 5 was not voted on separately. While agreeing with the concerns of the report and motion for a resolution, the CDS-PP cannot currently support anything which may be seen as encouraging a common fisheries policy which, in practice, has been conducted to the detriment of Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, yet again Parliament is addressing the situation in Chechnya, and rightly so. We have stressed again and again in previous sittings that we are keen for the Russian Federation to find a peaceful and political solution to this problem. We really have appealed to the Russian government not to handle this case in a way which violates all the international conventions which it has signed. Unfortunately, we are still unable to report any easing of tension in this war. Far worse! The situation has deteriorated considerably. The situation the civilian population find themselves in in Chechnya has become intolerable. We have no opportunity to take humanitarian action, despite the fact that we have stressed, time and again, and the Russian Federation assured us at the summit in Istanbul, that it would at least be possible, both for observers from the OSCE and humanitarian organisations, to enter Chechnya.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nothing remains except to repeat what has been said here in the House and what we wish to stress yet again in this joint motion for a resolution. We want a political solution to this conflict and all parties must be called upon to negotiate such a solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to relieve the situation of the civil population by calling once again on the Russian Federation to allow humanitarian organisations access to Chechnya and to allow OSCE observers to enter Chechnya.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the war in Chechnya largely started for reasons which are more to do with internal politics in Russia than with the situation in Chechnya itself. I therefore fear that there is little hope of the war ending before Mr Putin’s victory has been confirmed at the elections of 26 March, unless it is by total Russian victory before that time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is important is what happens once the conflict is over and that is hard to predict. It is obvious that the problems in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus, which rank among Russia’s poorest regions, will not be over when the war itself is over. When the Chechens are able to return to their homeland, they will find very little with which they can rebuild their lives. In the past, after the previous war, nothing came of the promised Russian reconstruction and it was difficult to grant foreign aid due to problems on both the Russian and Chechen sides.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the same time, it is also beneficial to look on the bright side, for example, the progress made in the three independent Caucasian states, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. There is no longer a threat of war there and the European institutions should be aware of the different situation there, because it is possible to have it this way.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the war in Chechnya has now been raging for four months. The European Parliament has condemned it and has demanded a ceasefire and political dialogue. Parliament has helped to ensure that humanitarian aid is given and that European Union funds are diverted in this direction. There is no end to the war and to the suffering of the civil population, let alone a permanent solution to the conflict. Has the EU really done everything in its powers? The fact is that the Council and some Member States, including Germany, are extraordinarily reticent in their political, diplomatic and economic reactions to Russian’s persistent refusal to enter into political dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union and its Member States must make it clear that the completely disproportionate use of military power to solve the conflict in Chechnya and the massive infringements of human rights are unacceptable. The European Parliament should fight for the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia to be suspended until Russia agrees to a ceasefire. In addition, we should call on the Member States to impose additional political, diplomatic and economic sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Arms deals and financial support for the warring factions must be stopped immediately. Russia’s sovereign right to protect its territorial integrity and pursue terrorists is undisputed. The question is, which instruments is it entitled to use in order to do so? The dividing line between dialogue and cooperation with Russia and sanctions because of the war is a very fine line. We should not discourage and isolate Russia as we did umpteen times in the last decade. Mutually advantageous cooperation and partnership with Russia are indispensable to the peaceful development of Europe. However, the European Union’s foreign policy will only be credible if it does not shrink from consistent political, diplomatic and economic action in the event of war and massive infringements of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, yesterday Members pointed out that Chechnya has been the number one item on the agenda time and again for months now. And what is the result of all our demands? We must, as Mr Sakellariou has quite clearly said, keep reiterating our demands. I believe that we must not tire of doing so because, as long as Russia dramatically steps up military force against its own civilian population, we must raise our voices here and say, ‘Enough is enough! We cannot accept this. This violates international human rights. This is not an internal matter for Russia.’</p>
      <p sl="de">The list of war crimes is getting longer and longer. Be it the young people arrested from the list of wanted refugees or the long list of rapes which arrived in my office today and which was drawn up by independent human rights observers. This is placing the women of the Islamic community in a very dramatic situation, which is why we must take special care of them. It is the numerous, small individual destinies which call for us to speak out. In the meantime, numerous important drinking water reservoirs have been contaminated by bombarding them with oil.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on all the Members to adopt this motion for a resolution together with the others. We received it after we had jointly debated the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot simply stand by and watch. Unlike Kosovo, the fact is that the 100 000 refugees are in Ingushetia without international aid. This tiny neighbouring republic is collapsing under the strain. I must say that I am surprised that there has been absolutely no reply on the part of the Commission to our demands. I expect a more specific position today on how you are implementing Parliament’s resolutions and the Helsinki resolutions. What you offered yesterday was a complete embarrassment to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this connection, I am waiting for you to examine what is really happening in Russia with paragraph 2 of the …</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the government of the Russian Federation deems itself to be a fully-fledged Member, for example of the Council of Europe. This brings with it obligations which extend far beyond all kinds of international agreements to protect human rights and far beyond the dictates of martial law. The relations which we have entered into with Russia in the form of treaties also point in the same direction.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the way in which the Russian government is trying to solve its differences with Chechnya flies in the face of these international rules. We can imagine that terrorism and, for example, aggression against Dagestan had to be dealt with. It is a fact that the Chechen authorities cannot be appointed as representatives of a regulated democratic constitutional state overnight. It was, for example, impossible for them to prevent the cruel kidnappings and hostage-takings in their own area, but the means used by Russia is disproportionate and is to be condemned in itself. I refer, in particular, to the bombardments of the people and the treatment of the people who are in the process of leaving that country.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are duty-bound to take a stand against this, not out of self-satisfaction because, as someone from a former colonial power, I know about this kind of war and the regret which surfaces say twenty or thirty years later for crimes committed, but for the future of Russia and Chechnya. That is what we care about it, hence this appeal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We therefore give our full backing to the resolution. The resolution mainly focuses on humanitarian aspects, the provision of aid, moving the Tacis programme in that direction, diplomatic consultation and possibly consultation based on the OSCE with regard to stability in the Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We, as a European Union, are willing to cooperate with international organisations where Russia requires and expects aid, but we will also have to do everything to continue this type of dialogue with Russia at all costs, even if it is difficult.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, what has changed in the four months that we have been addressing this question? First, Mr Putin’s soft putsch, which was cleverly timed for the eve of the new millennium, has put him in a very powerful position and has also made him one of the greatest political war profiteers of our time. However, I consider that he should use the power now at his disposal to conclude what General de Gaulle called the paix des braves , the peace of the brave. What I mean is that he now has the chance to put an end to this murderous war from a position of supreme strength. If he does not manage to do so, his presidential dreams may well drown in blood.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second fundamental point is that something else has changed: the mood among the Russian people. Thank God there is criticism. There is criticism from the mothers of the soldiers, there is criticism in the media and by human rights activists. They are still in a minority but it shows that the Russian people still have a conscience and that we must not hold the Russian people responsible for the actions of their leaders.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is this: I consider that in Chechnya itself the people have demonstrated an admirable will to resist, which is why I have a huge problem with point four of our resolution, although I fully understand that we are trying to protect the people of Chechnya from becoming the victims of genocide. I take the view that we, the European Union, must now exert massive political pressure by discussing article 2 of the partnership agreement and by ensuring that the Commission and Council also exert specific pressure, as Parliament has done from the beginning, within the framework of the modest means at its disposal. We, the EU, must speak with one voice and it should not just be up to the European Parliament to speak out. As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, I consider that a number of NGOs which have been providing real help for a long time are putting us to shame. I know of one consignment of baby food which has now got through. Unfortunately, however, the Commission has not managed to build up the appropriate channels in the vicinity and I should really like to know from the Commission why this has not been done. We must, at long last, provide real humanitarian aid against the genocide, because what is taking place in Chechnya is nothing less than genocide.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is not only during the last four months with this second military conflict that we have discussed the problem of the Caucasian people and Russia. We have also done so frequently in the past. So far, we have not yet had any success in the present Russian military conflict against the Chechen people. There is still no peace in this region and, despite the fact that the European Parliament has always made its political views very clear, we have not yet been successful.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that new political opportunities have opened up for us in Russia following the elections to the Duma and the resignation of President Yeltsin. I think that, in addition to considering what sanctions are sensible, the European Parliament must also try to engage in political dialogue with Russia. The composition of the Duma is quite different from any time in the past and that gives us a chance to find political allies, bring this military conflict in Chechnya to an end through political means and finally allow peace to come to the region.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all know that the problem of the Caucasian peoples will be far from resolved once the military conflict has come to an end. We shall then need political dialogue. We shall need political cooperation because this conflict did not come about today. Its roots lie in the history of the Caucasian people in and against Russia and against deportation and occupation by Russia. I think that it would be completely in keeping with the purpose of the European Parliament if we found allies for political dialogue once the military conflict has ended.</p>

Murders in Chechnya are bringing in the votes in Moscow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But our outrage cannot stop there. How are we to comprehend the complicit passiveness of the Western powers who see themselves as the champions of situations of humanitarian and military emergency and who had no hesitation in bombing Iraq and former Yugoslavia? Today, these powers are quietly cultivating the alcohol-fuelled Mafiosi cliques that run Russia. Let us remember the enthusiastic speeches by the American and European leaders singing the praises of Boris Yeltsin. By showing solidarity with the Russian government, they have favoured the re-establishment of the laws of the market, regardless of the defence of the rights of the people.</p>

I should also like to pay tribute to the militants of the transnational party who have been the only ones in Moscow to demonstrate against the war in Chechnya.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, I believe that we will not be able to pay tribute, for the reasons outlined by Mrs Schroedter, to our Commissioner, Mr Poul Nielson, who, in four months, has not found the time to go to Chechnya, to the region, to see to it that the European Union, at least in humanitarian terms – not in political terms, but at least in humanitarian terms – responds in a satisfactory way to the tragedy that is unfolding. I believe that is very serious. I hope that in the next few days we shall finally see Mr Nielson in Chechnya, well in the region at least, in Ingushetia, dealing at last with these refugees.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to quote two Chechen women refugees: “My son is 13. If we return, I fear that the Russians will arrest him instantly and effect his disappearance” and “The Russians are not liberators but occupiers. We used to get terrorised by the Islamites. Nowadays, it is the Russian soldiers.”</p>
      <p sl="nl">It appears that the end of the bloodshed in the Northern Caucasus is not in sight by a long chalk. Without any hesitation, the Russian Prime Minister and Acting President, Vladimir Putin, has impressed on an official delegation of the Council of Europe that the latter should not base its criticism of the Kremlin war on propaganda material. Indeed, this time, Moscow took instant control of the PR aspect of the second Chechen war to break out within the space of a few years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To no avail, however. The stories of the immense throng of Chechen refugees speak for themselves. Neither do all Russian politicians allow themselves to be bullied or intimidated by Putin and his circle of advisers. For example, the Presidential candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, who is inclined to reform, quite clearly states that it is criminal to use a war for election purposes. Yavlinsky argues in favour of a dialogue with the Chechen leaders as well as the people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This sound line of thinking deserves our support. Indeed, the really threatening alternative is a nigh hopeless guerrilla war. The present, politically stable resolution of the European Parliament aims to avoid this frightening and dangerous scenario at all costs. We will be able to measure its effect anyway when Mr Putin’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ivanov, pays a call on the Council of Europe in Strasbourg next week.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we have been pressing Russia to seek a political solution for Chechnya. Our threat of sanctions has not led to a result. To be able to have an influence on a political solution for Chechnya, I think we should embark on political dialogue on the issue with the Russian leadership; a political solution using political means with a new leadership. 70% of the members of the Duma are new, and Russia has a new acting president. This acting president has said he wants political dialogue. He has already met a delegation from the European Council and talked with them for three hours. I propose that a parliamentary delegation should go to Moscow to have political talks with the new leadership. I furthermore propose that Commissioner Christopher Patten, who has responsibility for foreign affairs, should likewise open political discussions on the situation in Chechnya. Using political means we can have an effect on a political war, which is now what it has become.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Commission remains fundamentally committed to a long-term partnership with Russia, based on the partnership and cooperation agreement and on a common strategy, with a view to strengthening security and stability in Europe, in the widest context. Therefore, in accordance with the clear position adopted by the Parliament, the Commission feels that it would be a mistake to sever all channels of communication. We should, in particular, be able to discuss with the Russians our extreme disapproval and our serious concerns about the situation in Chechnya.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Council in Helsinki sent a very clear message on the critical situation of the civilian population there and the need for Russia to respect the rules of humanitarian law, particularly in the context of the ultimatum sent to the inhabitants of Grozny, the excessive use of violence and the indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population, the obstacles to the safe and rapid provision of humanitarian aid by the aid agencies and the lack of real political dialogue with the legitimate Chechen authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The situation has not improved since the Helsinki Summit. Although the ultimatum sent to the population of Grozny was not carried out, we are still extremely concerned about the distress of the civilian population and especially of the people trapped in Grozny. The conditions under which humanitarian operations are being carried out remain difficult. No end is in sight as far as the military conflict is concerned in view of the fact that the Russian forces are coming up against quite strong resistance. The acting president, Putin, now speaks of a sustained operation. There are increasing fears that the neighbouring state of Georgia will be affected by the instability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The presidency and the Commission are actively involved in implementing the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki, that is to say, re-examining the implementation of the common strategy, suspending certain provisions of the cooperation agreement and applying strictly the commercial provisions, envisaging the transfer of TACIS funds to humanitarian aid and reducing TACIS 2000 to a basic programme with limited scope. These matters will be discussed next Monday by the foreign ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs Council. It is clear that we cannot anticipate the results at the moment, but I will ensure that my fellow Commissioner, Mr Chris Patten, is informed about the points raised during this debate so that he can pass them on to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I should like to stress that the Helsinki declaration has already been implemented in the form of specific measures that take particular account of the views of the Parliament, that is, postponement of the signing of the science and technology agreement and the strict application of the commercial provisions, starting with measures in the steel sector against the export tax on non-ferrous scrap.

The widespread dissatisfaction – with good reason – about the corrupt Bédié regime does not justify a coup d’état. It is now a case of the new leaders keeping their word and restoring democracy in the short term, laying down a constitution and ultimately holding free elections in June under international supervision. It is also essential that corruption is tackled. If the new regime does not keep its promises, the cooperation agreement with Europe will need to be suspended. The government of national unity has very little time to restore international confidence. The sooner it disappears from the scene via the ballot box, the better.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The compromise resolution on the situation in the Côte d’Ivoire requires the restoration of democratic legitimacy. But what are we dealing with here? Since the scandal of French colonial rule, via the dictatorship of Houphouët-Boigny and the regime of Konan Bédié that was as authoritarian as it was corrupt, to the military regime of Guei, the population of the Côte d’Ivoire has never experienced either truly free elections or democratic rights and freedoms. Behind the hypocritical rhetoric about democracy, the resolution deals mainly with the restoration of the authority of the State and the safety of property.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our own solidarity is with the overwhelming majority of the Côte d’Ivoire population, the workers, the unemployed, the small farmers, who have no possessions, who simply find it hard to survive. They have always had to suffer the repressive authority of the State as well as dictatorship and poverty. I would also point out the responsibility of the French State, whatever the colour of the government, which has not only supported the single party regime in the Côte d’Ivoire, but has presented it as a model of stability, even of democracy, for the whole of Africa. All that to protect the interests of the large French industrial concerns that are making themselves richer there by making the country poorer. So let us look to our own affairs before interfering in other people’s business, for if the real military regime of Guei and the false democracy of Bédié are reprehensible, then the great powers and their support for dictatorships in poor countries are even more reprehensible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, on 24 December a military coup violently interrupted democracy in the Côte d’Ivoire. The previous speakers have said everything, or almost everything, that had to be said on the imperfections of the previous regime. There have been accusations of corruption. Certainly there were some obvious risks that the presidential election to be held soon would be rigged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will take this opportunity to draw the attention of the House to the case of another country which is not discussed very much, Senegal, where a presidential election is due to be held which entails the same risks of rigging as in the Côte d’Ivoire. But let us be clear about the situation. In the Côte d’Ivoire, as elsewhere, these risks cannot be taken as an excuse for what happened there. In fact, a military coup is not, and never will be, a victory for democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Parliament must condemn this military coup, but it must not, of course, stop there. A transitional government has been formed and the European Parliament must put pressure on it to organise free and transparent elections from June 2000, as was requested by the West African Economic Community, in the presence of observers from the international community and on the basis of reliable electoral rolls.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, I would ask that the political leaders arrested at the time of this coup be released. Freedom of expression and the respect for human rights must be ensured once again. Under these conditions this House must closely follow the action of the Commission requesting the opening of consultations with a view to the possible suspension of cooperation between the European Union and the Côte d’Ivoire. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, the return to democracy in the Côte d’Ivoire must henceforth be a constant concern of this House and indeed of all people who wish for the law to prevail over force.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, democracy remains extremely fragile in Africa. This is once more illustrated in the Côte d’Ivoire, despite being a country which, for a long time, passed as a model of relative political and economic stability. Indeed, the Bédié regime has been caught up in a downward spiral lately. The IMF, the World Bank and the European Union had suspended their aid to the Côte d’Ivoire last year on account of lack of transparency and misuse of government money. Things went wrong in the political arena as well. The President started to display authoritarian and repressive traits, especially when he eliminated his major rival, Watara, in a very controversial manner. But are all these considerations of such dimensions that they legitimise a coup d’état? This is the sixty-four thousand dollar question. I cannot shake off the impression that the European Union is taking a more liberal stance towards the Côte d’Ivoire than in comparable situations. One cannot punish a coup d’état in Burundi by supporting an embargo and at the same time move on quickly to the order of the day in the Côte d’Ivoire as if nothing had happened. If we do not unequivocally condemn this coup, then we risk giving the military leaders in Africa an alibi to seize power by means of weapons. This is why the European Union must keep the pressure up and prioritise the restoration of the constitutional state and democracy by means of free and fair elections as a conditio sine qua non of cooperating any further with the Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let us, above all, not employ double standards. As far as I am concerned, Mr President, there are no good or bad coups d’état. Military solutions, wherever they occur in the world are, by definition, short-sighted solutions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Commission, the presidency and the Member States have expressed their grave concern about the dissolution of the public and legal institutions that followed the military coup. The European Union was already closely monitoring the development of the situation in the Côte d’Ivoire in the light of the arrest and imprisonment of the opposition leaders, the warrant for the arrest of Mr Ouattara, the development of inter-ethnic tensions and the deterioration in the economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, our prime objective is to encourage a rapid return to the rule of law and to the normal operation of democratic institutions. With this in mind, the Commission has decided to start the consultation procedure provided for in Article 366 bis of the Lomé Convention. This procedure is the same as that applied last year in respect of Niger and Guinea-Bissau. The Council approved this proposal. The Commission and the Council sent the relevant invitation to the Côte d’Ivoire. The Côte d’Ivoire authorities have a period of two weeks in which to reply to this invitation. After that, these consultations should be concluded within one month. The European Parliament will be kept informed about the progress of these consultations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The aims of these consultations will be as follows: to make a detailed assessment of the situation in the Côte d’Ivoire, to stress the importance that the European Union attaches to respect for the essential aspects of Article 5 of the Lomé convention, that is to say, respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights, to establish in detail the intentions of the Côte d’Ivoire to ensure that these essential aspects are respected, and to arrive at an agreement on the measures that will be taken to remedy the breaches of these essential aspects. The Commission and the Council are preparing these consultations, but I can already tell you that our aim is to obtain a firm commitment from the Côte d’Ivoire authorities to a return to constitutional order and the announcement of a timetable for this transition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If, however, the results of these consultations are not satisfactory, the European Union has the possibility at that time of taking the appropriate measures, including, if necessary, the complete or partial suspension of cooperation with this country. Up to now, no proposal has been made to end cooperation, as we wish to avoid penalising the people. This being the case, for the moment, no new financing decision will be approved, with the exception of humanitarian aid projects in favour of the most disadvantaged people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I can assure you that the Commission is attaching the greatest importance to the consultations that will be started in the next few days with the Côte d’Ivoire. It will continue to follow closely the development of the situation in this country and the respect for human rights, and the European Parliament will be informed accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to use today’s vote to register the Socialist Group’s concern on the extent of violence and bloody conflict between sectarian groups. In Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria, Lebanon, Chechnya and Kosovo, religious hatred and fanaticism are jeopardising peace, stability and development.</p>
      <p sl="el">The advent of the new millennium was accompanied not only by parties and celebrations but also, unfortunately, by sacrifices of blood, the worst in recent years, on the altar of the blind hatred born of religious fanaticism. We do, of course, acknowledge the efforts made by the Egyptian Government to deal with the extremists and to compensate the victims of the massacres. However, these efforts must be stepped up, an in-depth investigation must be carried out, the guilty must be punished and, most importantly, measures must be taken to strengthen democracy, respect for human rights and tolerance towards people of a different religious persuasion.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, one measure which could be taken as a mark of respect for human rights would be to repeal the mediaeval punishment which continues to be applied in Egypt. I refer to the death penalty. As the new year gets under way, we know that the Egyptian police had difficulty suppressing clashes between Christians and Muslims in the south of the country which cost 25 lives and during which dozens of homes and shops were looted. These violent episodes in Egypt followed on from earlier episodes of bloody attacks by Islamic fundamentalists on Christians in 1992 and 1997, which seriously affected tourism in Egypt, with adverse repercussions on the economic and social development of the country.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to use this vote to call on the Council and the Commission to plan action to increase public awareness of respect for human rights and religious tolerance within the framework of the MEDA programme.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-129" speaker_id="1788" name="Ducarme" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should first like to stress that as far as our Group is concerned, the emergency resolution is, above all, a means of exerting considerable pressure and is intended to address a current problem where the lack of control at political level may accentuate an existing risk. In this case, however, we believe that the proposed text does not warrant the use of urgent procedure. We believe this all the more because on studying the file, we have all noted that the facts reported do not have the political scope declared in the first recitals of the resolution before us. It is more a matter of infringements of common law in part of Egypt than acts resulting from religious antagonism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should, moreover, mention the inelegant way in which some of the paragraphs in the letter sent by the President of the Egyptian Parliament to the President of the European Parliament were simply copied out. Taking on arguments presented by others to defend oneself does not seem to me very commendable, even intellectually. Furthermore, knowing the aggressive interpretation that some Islamic circles give our initiatives, we are afraid of effectively giving them a weapon to show that the European Parliament is going too far in relation to a situation that does not justify such zealousness and such political determination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Liberal Group will not, therefore, vote in favour of this resolution. We shall abstain, while reserving the right to table a motion for a resolution that should lead the European Parliament to take a view that is different to the very limited view of what is happening in Egypt and in the whole of North Africa in terms of the defence of the rights of minorities and democratic rights.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-130" speaker_id="4341" name="Martin, Hugues" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you have before you a joint motion for a resolution on the recent acts of violence perpetrated in Upper Egypt, in which more than 20 Egyptian citizens were killed. You may know that I am also the rapporteur on the association agreement between the European Union and Egypt. The negotiations on the technical files were completed last June and we should very soon be dealing with the finalised text. This agreement will, I hope, mark the advent of ever closer relations between Egypt, which is an essential force in the Middle East and the Mediterranean area, and the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The political situation has now reached a favourable point in the Middle East and I should like to stress this fact in order to place our action in the wider context. Through this resolution, the Parliament seeks to express its feelings about the events that have occurred but also to point out that it will be very vigilant with regard to the matter of human rights in the context of negotiations with our Mediterranean partners, as we are with all our partners. Our action has focused on protecting human rights and democracy, and I believe it is essential to show that we shall continue to take a hard line on these matters and encourage those who take steps in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It has not escaped the attention of this House that the Egyptian authorities reacted quickly, quite rightly, in order to undertake an on-the-spot enquiry and especially to organise aid for the victims of this violence. President Mubarak himself intervened at the height of the crisis. It is therefore quite clear, in my view, that this resolution should be considered as a positive sign and as encouragement on our part and I would ask all my colleagues to approve this text which is the result of a compromise. In this vein, I should like to thank those members who jointly signed this motion for the goodwill they showed in order to arrive at a joint text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is true that this text has evolved, what is more, in association with the Egyptian authorities, which is a very good omen.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-131" speaker_id="4388" name="Boumédiene-Thiery" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, for about ten years there has been a wave of violence across Egypt. Despite this, all we have observed, both from the international community and from our own European institution, is a long silence. It is true that Egypt plays a fundamental part in the peace process in the Middle East and its geopolitical situation means that nobody dares to speak up about distressing matters. We can only be delighted that a debate has finally been held on this country, a country that is at the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the debate is being held because of such an unfortunate current situation in that country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, we support the efforts of the Egyptian government to combat the rise of religious fundamentalism, but this battle against the extremists cannot justify infringement of the rights of the Egyptian people, particularly their political rights. It cannot draw a veil over attacks on human rights such as freedom of expression and fundamental rights. In this regard, we condemn the fact that this country has retained the death penalty. Finally, we would ask the Council to make provision in the MEDA programme for specific measures in favour of social and economic development, the development of democracy and the promotion of tolerance between all the ethnic and cultural minorities that make up the richness of Egyptian society.</p>

    <intervention id="4-133" speaker_id="1413" name="Ford" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is only right and proper that the European Parliament puts on record its concerns with respect to the human rights situation in China. There have been far too many cases for us to ignore with respect to religious intolerance, discrimination against ethnic minority groups and continued use of the death penalty. We also have concerns about the political freedoms in Hong Kong and in the future in Macao. It is right that we put pressure on China to improve its record. In the EU it is important that we continue that pressure.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I have two concerns. Firstly, we must be careful not to unnecessarily endanger China's accession to the WTO because WTO membership in the medium term would do more to transform China's economy and China's human rights situation than anything else. Opening up China and bringing it into the global economy must have positive consequences with respect to human rights. Many in China's ruling circles know and welcome this. We must be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water, in acting to try to get the best and end up siding with the interests of the worst.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we must continue to criticise China. I will continue to do so where necessary, but I hope we will not see an over-emphasis on China at the expense of other regimes in the world, whose records are as bad, if not worse. This only gives China an excuse to ignore our demands.</p>

    <intervention id="4-134" speaker_id="2155" name="Watson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the most worrying thing about the situation in China is that, despite all the dialogue we have had with China, the human rights situation is, by many accounts, deteriorating. There is a continued crackdown on dissidents, on labour rights activists, on religious groups, and in recent months we have seen the detention without trial of many leaders of the Falun Gong movement. There are real problems in China with torture and forced labour camps. But, perhaps most seriously, more than 60 different offences are punishable by the death penalty, many of them non-violent offences.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is judicial executions that are perhaps the greatest cause of concern. In 1998, Amnesty International recorded 2 700 death sentences and 1 769 confirmed executions. This is a very serious problem. We need to continue dialogue with China; we need to seek, through dialogue and through trade, to open up Chinese society to western ideas and try to convince them of the error of their ways.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the human rights situation in China has clearly deteriorated further. Hong Kong is a case apart: it also has a special “symptom value”. The flight of the Karmapa Lama brought into the spotlight an increase in religious persecution in China. This being the case, I say yes to China joining the WTO, but, hand in hand with that, we must call on that country to ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Commitment to human rights through rhetoric is important; it is the first step. Other means must also be used for the EU to convey its concern, and we should particularly give our support to the critical statement to be made by the United States at the forthcoming UN Commission on Human Rights Conference.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-136" speaker_id="4513" name="Van Orden" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, with the presence in Strasbourg this week of Martin Lee, the eminent Hong Kong democratic leader, and the arrival of a high-level Chinese WTO negotiating team in Brussels on Monday, the issue of human rights in China is again most topical. By bringing this matter to the fore we are not seeking confrontation with China, a country for which we have great respect and considerable admiration. What a pity that the enormous economic progress made by China over the last ten years or so has not been matched by similar progress in political and religious freedom and the rule of law. Of course there must be dialogue on these matters but this must have a positive outcome in terms of genuine and substantive reforms. It is not acceptable to say that western norms are not applicable to China. Human rights are universal and, in this respect, Asian values are no different from our values.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Hong Kong we see erosion of hard-won freedoms and guarantees. Maybe it is no surprise, however, that demonstrations about Tibet are banned there, when they are barely allowed in London, if the Chinese President is visiting.</p>
      <p sl="en">In mainland China we should congratulate the recent leadership for getting rid of communism, but in its place we have seen the growth of a corrupted form of capitalism without democracy. The Chinese Government must stop the harassment and imprisonment of Christians, such as Li Dexian in Guandong province and the repression of Buddhists in Tibet and elsewhere. I call upon the Chinese authorities to have the courage to allow democrats such as Martin Lee to travel freely in mainland China. We want to see a China that is fully part of the international community, with true democracy and the rule of law. When will China set out a timetable for democracy?</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Busquin, although I understand that human rights and trade negotiations are usually handled separately in the European Union, I would ask the Commission to ensure that the concerns of this House are strongly brought to the attention of the Chinese WTO negotiators next week.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Union prides itself on its record of defending human rights. Unfortunately, individual Member States refuse to criticise China's human rights record for fear that it will damage their trading relationships. This political card weakens the moral authority of the EU to speak on the abuse of human rights elsewhere in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am the rapporteur for Hong Kong in this Parliament and I am concerned at the number of incidents which have happened in that part of the world which, once again, show abuse of human rights. The removal of Cheung Man-Yee as the broadcasting director of radio and television in Hong Kong was a direct attack on the freedom of the press and the decision of Hong Kong's SAR government to ask for reinterpretation of a recent unpopular high court ruling strikes at the heart of the rule of law when the decision of the final court of appeal should have been accepted. The treatment of Falun Gong practitioners and the refusal to allow LEGCO legislators to travel to mainland China are all indicative of the problems that remain in that part of the world and are issues which I will address in my report. It is vitally important that the EU, both as an institution and through its Member States, criticises, where appropriate, human rights abuses by China.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the human rights situation in China has deteriorated badly over the past year. Think of the increasing number of executions, the league of the Falun Gong movement and the suppression of Tibet, illustrated by the recent escape of the fourteen-year-old Tibetan Karmapa Lama to India.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Liberal Group have had enough. An EU-China human rights dialogue is fine as long as results are forthcoming. If not, action needs to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Since the US has given to understand that it wants to support a UN resolution on China during the next meeting in Geneva, I call on the Council to do the same unanimously. Indeed, in the past, it has become clear how harmful it is if certain Member States let their national interests prevail. The Netherlands experienced this three years ago when, as the country holding the presidency of the European Union, it supported a UN resolution which was not supported unanimously by the other Member States. This resulted in economic sanctions for the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This resolution is the litmus test for our “Mr CSFP”, Mr Solana. On him rests the ultimate task of bringing the Member States into line this time, so that the Council can, as a united front, step into the breach in defence of universal human rights.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-140" speaker_id="2268" name="Sjöstedt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the situation regarding human rights in China is still very serious. The most basic of democratic and human rights are not respected. Attempts to form political opposition are met with imprisonment, horrific punishments and expulsions. There are now thousands of political prisoners in the country. When they are not controlled by the Communist party, attempts to organise independent trade unions, together with union struggles for workers’ rights, are not tolerated. It is depressing to see how a state which pretends to act in the interests of the working class oppresses that self-same working class when the latter fights for its legitimate rights. The death penalty is imposed and carried out in a frightening number of cases. Religious freedom is not respected. The persecution of supporters of the Falun Gong movement is astounding and indefensible. Many minority peoples, such as the Tibetans, are oppressed and do not only lack democratic, but also cultural rights. There is a string of documented cases of violence and other outrages committed by prison staff and police.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There is therefore a very good basis for the critical resolution we are to vote through in a while. I shall naturally be voting for it. That does not mean that I think that all parts of the text are perfect. I think, for example, that part of the content of paragraph 4 should have been expressed differently. I should also like to have seen a line in the resolution about the lack of union rights in China. We see, of course, how the Chinese government has reacted against the strikes and demonstrations and attempts at union organisation which we have seen in recent times. I should also like to warn against a development which involves toning down criticism of the lack of human rights in order to achieve economic and trading advantages.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-141" speaker_id="2027" name="Segni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, at the start of the sitting on Monday afternoon, I asked Parliament and the President to send the Governor of Texas a message in order to prevent an execution which was to take place this week. This is all the more reason why, and with much more forceful arguments, Parliament must now address the situation in China where the violation of human rights is reaching extremely high levels. Other speakers have already said all this and I can only agree with them. The real confirmation is that, in China, the human rights situation is deteriorating: while new economic processes are struggling to get underway, there is a terrible deterioration in human rights. Figures from Amnesty International tell of around 700 prisoners condemned to death; another source reports that as many as 1 400 executions were carried out last year. Whatever the true figure, this is clearly a terrible revelation. The problem, then, is how the Union and Parliament can respond to this situation. The first thing to do, in my opinion, is concentrate our efforts on the forthcoming meeting of the UN Committee on 20 March in Geneva where this will be the first item on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now, I wonder, and would ask the House, whether we can request that the Union, or even Parliament, be represented at this meeting. Above all, however, and this has already been said, it is important for the Union to not only speak out on this issue, but to manage to obtain a strong and determined common position of the individual countries as well. People were right to say that major positions taken by the Union are undermined if individual countries contradict them out of economic or commercial interests.</p>
      <p sl="it">On this point, one issue should be considered: China’s request to join the World Trade Organisation. I realise that there are very positive aspects to this, and that, indirectly, it could be advantageous, but the request must not be linked with the UN’s global position nor, in this regard, with China’s firm request to make progress. In this way, maybe we will be able to move on from making appeals, which are necessary but insufficient, to practical action.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I have some good news for you: the movement of disinvestment in China by western companies, including European companies, is increasing and gathering pace. Parliament is therefore no longer alone in opposing the Council and the Commission which, for years, have followed a short-sighted policy in respect of the People’s Republic of China, a policy which, as in the case of the Soviet Union, is based on collusion with a dictatorial regime, a communist regime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So the good news is that we have an ally in European businessmen and manufacturers. We should endeavour to strengthen this alliance in order to get the Council and the Commission to at last take a firm and tough line with regard to the People’s Republic of China.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We shall also have to take care to provide an option because, as you know, the communists only understand the language of force. So it is important that they should know that our words will be backed up by action and that our policy will be credible. We have, and I believe we should thank the Portuguese presidency for this, one possible major option that is feasible: we can establish a strategic alliance with the largest and most highly populated democracy in the world. I am speaking of India, and the Portuguese presidency, which announced the first summit to be held between the European Union and India, gives us the opportunity to work specifically to develop this option.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that this is the only initiative that could bring the Chinese Communist authorities to understand that we are not speaking in vain and that we are working seriously to ensure that the Chinese communist empire collapses at last and that democracy is at last established in China and in Tibet, in Eastern Turkestan and in Lower Mongolia, which, like Chechnya, are places that are still subjected to savage colonisation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, today we are addressing various aspects of the dramatic human rights issue, and although we are from another part of the world, Parliament must speak out loud and clear at a time when the situation in Iraq continues to be very serious. First of all, this country constitutes a threat for the entire region, and secondly, it represents a clear, continuous and patent violation of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to call for the Kuwaiti prisoners to be released – according to reliable reports, there are around 600 prisoners of war apparently held in absolutely inhuman conditions – acknowledging the authoritative figures speaking up in the Arab world, such as the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Abdel Meguid, who is asking for human rights to be respected and for reconciliation between the Arab States. We must not forget that, when all is said and done, this is all the consequence of a clear violation of states’ rights, as at the time of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. I would invite Parliament to speak out on this, while bearing in mind that, according to reliable sources, it seems that, unfortunately, Kuwait is also holding quite a number of Iraqi prisoners of war, and again the conditions these prisoners are living in give cause for concern.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to convince Kuwait that its justified case for its rights to be respected would be much stronger if it first fulfilled its duties towards humanity and its rights.</p>

    <intervention id="4-145" speaker_id="4346" name="Martínez Martínez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">The case of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war is dramatic. These consist of more than 600 men and women dragged from their country by the defeated Iraqi forces when they withdrew, after having invaded and wrecked Kuwait ten years ago now.</p>
      <p sl="es">These people are perfectly identifiable thanks to a particular circumstance: 4 000 prisoners were being held in Bassora at the end of the war. At that point the Iraqi military, in an initial operation, carried off some of their captives, possibly towards Baghdad. Then the Shiite rebellion erupted in Bassora. It was ferociously repressed, but the remaining 3 000 or more prisoners were able to escape and return to their country. Those who returned were therefore able to precisely identify those others who had been their fellow captives.</p>
      <p sl="es">More then 600 disappearances in a population of 700 000 Kuwaitis is a very high number, and this case has therefore become a genuine national catastrophe.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the meantime, and despite the efforts of the Red Cross and the United Nations, the Iraqi regime has been refusing to provide any information about the fate of these people. The material difficulties of the families have been resolved by the Kuwaiti authorities, but the human tragedy is enormous.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have spoken to parents who have seen four sons disappear, wives who have seen their husbands taken away and young people who were children when their fathers were arrested. To the suffering of the victims themselves, we can therefore add the pain of their families and serious legal problems, such as those of the women who, after so much time, do not know whether they are married or widowed.</p>
      <p sl="es">My conviction is that the international community must demand that Iraq provides a response to these cases. However terrible the response may be, the suffering of the families will be less than the current situation of uncertainty, which is unbearable for them and intolerable to us.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will end by insisting on a point contained in the motion for a resolution. It recommends to the European Union and the Member States that, as a condition for normalising relations with Iraq, the leaders of that country must give answers to the question of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war. For the Group of the Party of European Socialists, this is as important as the demand that Iraq disarms from a nuclear, chemical and biological point of view. Let us hope that our resolution will serve both to encourage those, in Kuwait, who are maintaining pressure and hope, and as a warning to those in Iraq who are responsible for this grave situation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, with the authority conferred on our Group by the fact that we have always opposed any type of embargo, on the grounds that it is the population which suffers, and also because we are always defending international legality as a standard for co-existence and peaceful solutions to conflicts, we demand not only that the fate of these prisoners, taken illegally during the invasion of Kuwait, be clarified, but also that they be returned to their homeland – Kuwait – because this would help in reaching a solution to the other problems.</p>
      <p sl="es">But it is not only this question – so well described by Mr Martínez Martínez – but also the fact that, in Iraq, there is continuous violation of human rights which makes daily life impossible. We therefore think that this proposal should be put in a context of Iraq’s compliance with all the United Nations’ requirements, so that the embargo may be lifted and democracy returned to the people.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the problem of prisoners of war and those who have disappeared is a part of the catastrophic human rights situation and the plight of citizens in Iraq. Already back in 1992, the UN Commission on Human Rights’ special observer, Max van der Stoel, said that the seriousness of Iraq’s violations of human rights in the world context was only matched by the events of the Second World War. According to the most recent report dating from last year, the situation has only grown worse. We have to address this problem in one way or another. Prisoners of war are the first step, but the ordinary citizens are in a wretched state and, furthermore, weapons monitoring, for example, must be properly organised. This Ekeus affair – the row over it – is a good example. These matters must now be raised systematically.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Is this problem sufficiently topical to justify the urgent procedure? In my view, it is. It is true that it is a problem which has lasted since the end of the war, for over 9 years, and the insistent demands which we, the European Parliament and the International Red Cross, have made have not so far been satisfied. At this point, I should like to endorse and emphasise what Mr Martínez Martínez has just told us. We should take the opportunity now to resume the negotiations between the European Union and Iraq with a view to possibly lifting the embargo. In my view this opportunity justifies bringing in the subject under the urgency procedure and justifies the motion for a resolution submitted for the vote of Parliament. If we do not take this opportunity, I believe that we shall be failing in our duty.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Arab world is in turmoil. The conflicts in Egypt which we were discussing earlier have not taken place, primarily, against a religious background but against an economic background, and the Egyptian state and the religious communities are making a responsible effort to defuse the problem. Egypt and Libya have taken an initiative to bring peace to Sudan to which we should give massive support. Syria is speaking to Israel, despite a myriad of problems. Only Iraq persists in total inaction and I am of the opinion that this should make us reconsider our position. We must pursue a clear human rights and disarmament policy against Saddam Hussein. However, I should like to support emphatically what Mr Morillon said; we need new negotiations now. We need a new approach if we really are to succeed in helping people, making progress, linking the possible easing of sanctions to actual progress, up to and including the naming of victims of persecution and imprisonment. We at last need a European initiative in order to bring action to the fore.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is actually nothing short of a miracle that this pipeline is under discussion at all today in this Parliament because so much lobbying has gone into preventing its discussion. We are pleased that we can discuss it today. This is a good start. Indeed, the pipeline in question is the very controversial oil pipeline between Chad and Cameroon, two countries which score very badly in terms of human rights, the fight against poverty and legal certainty. The example of Ogoniland springs to mind if we think what harmful consequences the installation of an oil pipeline can have if the right precautions are not taken and the right guarantees not given.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is even so bad that the oil pipeline is already casting its shadow forward, because those who dare criticise it in the country itself are quite simply thrown into prison in Chad. If this, now, is the way in which a constitutional state deals with environmental protest, one dreads to think what would happen in the case of more serious assaults when a corrupt regime is profiting from the existence of such a pipeline. We would therefore urge the European Investment Bank not to ape whatever the World Bank decides, because the World Bank is lobbying intensely so that it can support this pipeline and because we know that the people, the only representatives of civil society who were invited to be present at a protest meeting in America, were, in fact, lobbyists.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are, therefore, highly concerned that the European Members who sit as Members on the Board of the World Bank will not have sufficient time to elucidate a precise position on this matter, simply because there is so little objective information available. That is why I ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that the European Investment Bank does not help support this pipeline, unless all social and environmental precautions have actually been taken.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is right that the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline project, which has been planned over several years, is subject to a European Parliament urgency procedure today, both because it is reported that the World Bank may be on the verge of making its decision and because of deep concerns at reports of harassment and intimidation against the project's opponents.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have met with the Chad Government representatives who, contrary to claims of those on the other side of the Chamber, say they have not threatened to withdraw their invitation to Parliament's mission to Chad because we are holding this debate. Indeed, they claim that there is now observance of democracy, human rights and transparency in relation to this project.</p>
      <p sl="en">But if that is so, why do we continue to receive reports of consultation at gunpoint? Why is one German development NGO threatening to pull out because of threats and attacks by the Chadian military? Why, on 4 January, did one expatriate resident in N'Djamena find her home attacked by Chadian soldiers? If the oil pipeline project is transparent, why do independent studies question its efficacy so fundamentally? For instance, Professor Rosenblum of Harvard questions the impact on poverty; Professor Downing of the University of Arizona concludes there is a failure to meet the World Bank indigenous peoples' guidelines; and the University of Warwick from my own country considers there will be a potential loss to national income from the project if potential spills and leaks are taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is right that the European Parliament should express its concern about a World Bank which is still pursuing the old policies of privatisation, major infrastructure projects and mass agricultural exports which have become so discredited. As for the oil companies themselves, why do they need to see the environmental protection requirements lifted, development controls waived and the unfettered right of action in the event of civil emergency which will allegedly give them ‘carte blanche to act as a paramilitary power’? Can the European Investment Bank really justify giving EUR 8 million direct to Exxon in these circumstances? We do not want to see another Ogoniland in Africa.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, to throw some light on this debate, I should like to quote you some figures that speak for themselves, first and foremost, with regard to Chad. It is the fifth poorest nation in the world. Life expectancy is less than 50 years. One child in five dies before the age of 5. The annual per capita income is 180 dollars. Cameroon scarcely fares any better, with an income per inhabitant of around 650 dollars.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why am I quoting you these figures? Simply because they express and illustrate the urgent need to offer these countries, particularly Chad, the development opportunities to which they are entitled. I believe that it is in this context that the great oil field project in the south of Chad and the construction of an oil pipeline between Chad and the Cameroon coast should be carefully examined. This project is now considered to be essential to the development of these two countries. Let us for a moment consider that the anticipated effects of operating these oil fields could increase the gross domestic product of Chad by almost 10 points and earn this country between 5 and 10 billion dollars.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The World Bank, which has not yet issued its final opinion, is following this project very closely and is helping Chad to bring it to fruition. The three main points of discussion, i.e. the environment, social problems and the management of the income from the projects have been the subject of in-depth studies for almost four years. If this is anything to go by, 900 meetings have been held on the route of the oil pipeline, 40 000 people have given their opinions and 250 NGOs have been consulted. The director of one of these, the World Wide Fund for Nature, even said that in environmental terms, the project to install the oil pipeline is one of the best in the world. Nonetheless, we must, of course, continue to closely monitor the consequences of such a project and ensure that the absolute minimum amount of damage is done in environmental and human terms. That is the reason for the debate today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If, by chance, on completion of these additional studies, the World Bank, whose criticisms I find hard to understand, were to give an unfavourable opinion, it would be out of the question to continue. But, on the other hand, if the Bank did, in the end, support this programme, it would mean that our legitimate fears could be allayed. It would also mean that our attention would for once actually be focussed on the development of the poorer countries, which we discuss frequently in this House. Human rights, ladies and gentlemen, also mean rights to development.</p>

      <p sl="nl">We have had bad experiences with oil projects in Africa. This is why we need to be extra critical in our assessment of this project in terms of its relevance to development and environmental conditions. The proposed Chad-Cameroon pipeline could generate substantial revenue for these countries, revenue which cannot be obtained in any other way. My Group notes that the original plans were punctuated by major objections. The plans have since been adapted on all these points and it remains to be seen whether this is now sufficient. We are of the opinion that the project can only be passed in the short term if it has been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it meets the strictest criteria, if the World Bank has given the green light explicitly and unambiguously and if, at the same time, it is absolutely clear that human rights are no longer being violated. Only if this is the case is the European Investment Bank free to grant loans. As far as our Group is concerned, it is a test case of whether it is possible to have good experiences with oil projects in Africa.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Commission is concerned about the recent outbreaks of violence upon the Christian populations in the Al Kocheh region in Upper Egypt and deplores the loss of a large number of lives. It notes the measures already adopted by the Egyptian government to restore calm to the region and is very pleased about its commitment to bring those responsible to justice. It awaits with interest the preliminary report by the Egyptian public prosecutor, which is due out next week.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From the first signs, the recent incidents would appear to be fundamentally different to those that occurred in August 1998, which were essentially triggered by the violent reaction and the incompetence of the police and not by any sectarian behaviour on their part. The recent events, however, appear to be of a religious nature, although they were set off by a simple trading dispute. In Upper Egypt, as elsewhere, chronic under-development can exacerbate religious tensions dangerously, which is the reason why the measures to restore harmony between the different communities must go hand in hand with socio-economic development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the context of its cooperation with Egypt, the Commission is endeavouring primarily to find a balance between measures to modernise the economy and social measures, including measures to combat poverty and to promote a civil society and human rights. Upper Egypt is one of the regions covered by the social measures and measures to combat poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as China is concerned, the Commission shares the concerns of Members of Parliament about the human rights situation in China, particularly in Tibet. These matters were discussed at the highest level at the second European Union-China summit on 21 December 1999 in Peking. On 14 January, the Union also made a formal approach to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing its serious concerns about the fate of political dissidents, the freedom of worship of members of Christian churches and the treatment meted out to some followers of the Falun Gong movement. These matters, as well as conditions of imprisonment, labour camps, freedom of speech, freedom of association and the rights of women and ethnic minorities will also be on the agenda at the next European Union-China talks on human rights to be held on 25 February in Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After this meeting and these talks, and in the light of the results, the position to be adopted by the Union at the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights will be defined. The Union considers that the improvement of the human rights situation in China and that country’s negotiations for membership of the WTO are two major issues that should be dealt with separately, using specific instruments and in specific forums. In general, the Commission believes that the opening up of the economy and the liberalisation of trade that will speed up China’s membership of the WTO will, in the long term, favour improvements in human rights, the strengthening of civil society and the formation of the rule of law in China and it will pay special attention to these latter aspects in the context of the World Trade Organisation talks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question of Tibet has already been widely discussed through existing channels of communication with the Chinese authorities. Also, the ambassadors of the troika in 1998 sent an observer mission to Tibet and the Commission is committed to continuing along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the problem of the Gulf War prisoners in Iraq, the Commission, like Parliament, is concerned about Iraq’s lack of cooperation with regard to the missing Kuwaitis and is aware of the intolerable effect this situation must have on their families. The Commission urges Iraq to respect the United Nations Security Council resolutions in this regard and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as you have emphasised, has been given responsibility for the case of the missing Kuwaitis, in accordance with these United Nations resolutions. Unfortunately, however, Iraq refuses to cooperate, even with the mediation of this international organisation. The Commission supports the efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross and, as the Commission does not have any contractual relations with Iraq, there is therefore no official dialogue with the Iraqi government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I should like to assure you that the Commission is fully behind the regime of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, which form a response to the tragic human rights situation in that country. But, and I believe this is also an important point, as some of you have mentioned, despite these infringements of United Nations Security Council resolutions by Iraq, the Commission will continue, through the intermediary of ECHO, to provide humanitarian aid to the Iraqis to alleviate their suffering. The Commission is the main supplier of humanitarian aid to Iraq, to the tune of EUR 240 million since 1991 and, in the context of its programme for the year 2000, ECHO has released EUR 10 million for humanitarian aid for Iraq. We therefore make a clear distinction between the people and the constraints with regard to human rights that are the work of the Iraqi State. The Commission will support all the measures in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, as far as the human rights violations in Chad and Cameroon are concerned, in conjunction with the current planning of the oil pipeline, the European Commission is closely following this situation with regard to extending the democratic process, the protection of human rights and reinforcement of the rule of law. It is also focusing its attention on the oil project planned in the south of the country which will cross Cameroon. The Commission is not directly involved in financing this project, but it has, on several occasions, shown understanding for Chad’s right to wish to manage its only resource, provided that the necessary precautions are taken with respect to the protection of the environment and the protection of the rights of the local people, on the one hand, and the actual allocation of the future oil revenue to the development of the country, on the other. We shall ensure that the European Investment Bank is informed of these concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Chad, the operation of the oil project could be a very important factor in the country’s development and in consolidating the rule of law if this revenue is used advisedly. That is why the European Commission is endeavouring to encourage the government to continue the dialogue on the questions raised by the oil project with the country’s main partners, including with itself and to involve the local authorities and the non-governmental organisations closely in the preparatory work. This is so that the progress already made on the most critical aspects of the oil project can be consolidated, if necessary.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is, in fact, the third time within the space of six months that we have had to draw the Commission’s attention to the situation in the Moluccas. We are dissatisfied with the very restricted way in which the Commission has reacted to the resolutions so far.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The violence in the Moluccas erupted as long ago as last year. Initially, it was dwarfed by the events in East Timor, but that does not make the situation in the Moluccas less serious. In October, hundreds of people were killed. Meanwhile, three months later, there are reports of thousands of killings and many more people wounded and becoming refugees.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The causes are wide-ranging, of course. The area has been economically disadvantaged under the Suharto regime and this regime is also partly responsible for the country’s questionable migration policy. What is more serious, however, is the fact that there are now agitators, like on East Timor, who are setting groups of the population against each other, while the army is playing a questionable role, unfortunately. The latter was confirmed, in fact, in an interview with President Wahid last night on Dutch TV, in which he stated that the army’s behaviour in this conflict is also reprehensible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Our resolution’s criticism is emphatically not aimed at the new government in Indonesia, which is making a genuine effort to restore democracy and address the human rights violations. It seems that evil in Indonesia is mainly to be found in the form of aggressive Muslim organisations and agitators in sections of the army.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What can the European Union do? To start with, it could give a warning sign, much like that given by Mr Holbrooke, that a coup d’état by the army in Indonesia will not be tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, an independent committee of inquiry could be set up and sent to Indonesia, preferably with a UN mandate, to establish what has happened in the past couple of months. At the same time, a conciliation committee could be sent to the area to reconcile Muslims and Christians.</p>
      <p sl="nl">President Wahid has already made this request and also put a name forward. It would be a good idea if the European Union were to support such an initiative. Of course, a great deal more aid is required than is given at present.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to point out that the arms embargo must be extended. There is every reason to do so as long as the role of the army is so questionable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to note that the conflict and violence in the Moluccas have been going on for too long. The Netherlands has a large Moluccan community. It is a European community and for this reason, the European Union cannot ignore the problems of the Moluccas. We would urge both the Council and the Commission to be more decisive than they have been so far.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Wiersma.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the decision taken by the Council of Ministers to lift the arms embargo against Indonesia is short-sighted and premature. Indonesia has meanwhile made the first few steps towards a democratic society. But as the American UN ambassador, Mr Holbrooke, underlined again this week, warning us of the Indonesian army, the transition to a fully-fledged democratic system is certainly not a foregone conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The role which the Indonesian army played in the riots on East Timor has still not been cleared up. Tension in Indonesia is mounting. Djakarta has not got the situation in the Moluccas under control. MEP Maat has just made this point as well. Large groups of citizens no longer feel safe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With a premature lifting of the arms embargo, Europe threatens to be an accessory to the escalating violence. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the Council needs to reconsider its decision. We strongly urge the Member States, pending a new decision, not to resume arms supplies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We would ask the Commission and Council to take four steps. First of all, the European Union needs to send a mission to Djakarta to discuss with the Wahid government a way out of the crisis. Secondly, the EU needs to conclude agreements with the Indonesian government about permitting independent observes in the Moluccas. Thirdly, more humanitarian aid is needed for all sections of the population. Lastly, more aid via the UN and NGOs is needed for refugees and the homeless.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By way of conclusion, could I just say how disappointed we, the Dutch social-democratic delegation, are at the attitude of our Foreign Minister who, like a weathervane, cannot stick to any one position. At first, he supported the arms embargo but changed his mind after his visit to Djakarta.</p>

But I urge the EU Council of Ministers to reconsider.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meantime, there should be no resumption of the arms trade by Member States. This gives the wrong signals at the wrong time.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the current united state of Indonesia is a product of 350 years of Dutch colonial rule. The population in the Moluccas, which was converted to Christianity, was recruited for the colonial army which had to keep the other nations under Dutch power. Fifty years ago, a large number of the Southern Moluccan population moved to the Netherlands and since then, the inhabitants of the densely populated island of Java have emigrated in massive numbers to the other islands. This has made the Moluccans who were left behind a minority in their own region. In 1965, the Indonesian army carried out a coup d’état which probably took the lives of one million people. Even after the 1999 elections, the army is still not under democratic control. It acts as an instigator of disagreement between different groups of nations. Monday last, I asked the Council to maintain the arms embargo against Indonesia. In this way, Dutch and French companies are not in breach of contract if they do not carry out prior orders of military equipment. Europe should not be surprised that civil wars keep breaking out in Indonesia if we refuse to recognise that the army has an interest in the thrashing out of ethnic and religious conflicts rooted in the colonial past.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the last time we spoke about the Moluccas in this House, I said that, this time, we were talking about the Moluccas, but that I feared that soon, we would be talking about other parts of Indonesia. Just to make it clear, this was not to devalue the specific discussion and the specific problems in the Moluccas at the time, but an analysis of the problem in Indonesia which goes far beyond the issue of the Moluccas and which is very deep-rooted and structural. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was right. The most recent reports now indicate that the worst atrocities are taking place on Lombok, scenes which remind us of the Moluccas and other places in Indonesia where conflict broke out, and that the next hotbeds of unrest are already revealing themselves, for example on Sulawesi. All this is the result of, among other things, hate campaigns orchestrated even by the chairman of the legislative meeting, among others.</p>
      <p sl="nl">President Wahid’s reaction, however, is encouraging. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if the European Parliament were to support him in his fight against intolerance and for a moderate, liberal form of Islam, but also, in particular, in his fight against large sections of the army, the army which does not take sufficient action against troublemakers and even refuses to account for its own role on East Timor, for example.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I fail to grasp, however, is how President Wahib would benefit from the resumption of arms supplies. The EU has all kinds of means to influence the process in Indonesia. One of the Members has already listed them: observers, humanitarian aid. But this also includes – with a special appeal to the Member States – an arms embargo. What is needed in Indonesia is for the role of the army to be suppressed, not to be reinforced by supplying more weapons.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, by deciding not to extend the embargo on the sale of arms to Indonesia, the Council of Ministers has this month adopted a position contrary to the one recommended by Parliament last month on the basis of a broad consensus. The situation in the Moluccas, clearly set out in the joint motion for a resolution, is evidence that the reasons for the embargo have not changed, which is why Parliament’s position remains the same. As the current Indonesian Government itself decided a month ago, after the free elections, to be ruled by the values of democracy, including respect for human rights, it deserves the appreciation and solidarity of the international community.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The situation in the Moluccas, which is not an isolated case in Indonesia, requires caution and discretion in the expression of this solidarity. This situation has arisen in particular due to the internal migration policy promoted by the Suharto military dictatorship with which the current actions of the Indonesian armed forces are associated. These actions represent a repetition of the worst events in East Timor, as if nothing had changed in the country.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore support the necessary reinforcement of international cooperation, mainly through humanitarian aid to Indonesia and assistance with respective development. In this way we can demonstrate our appreciation of the democratic nature of the current government, thereby helping to increase its authority.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am against the sale of arms to armed forces which have yet to understand their position in a rule of law which should bring them under the control of the government. Given the circumstances, the right signal would be sent by extending the embargo on the sale of arms to Indonesia.</p>

      <p sl="nl">It would be a disaster if the military were to resume power in Indonesia. This is why Europe has to support President Wahid in his attempts to restore peace in the Moluccas. So far, the European Union has done precious little. We need to provide more humanitarian aid and help the Indonesians gather Muslims and Christians round the negotiating table. A European mission, for example under the guidance of former Dutch Prime Minister Lubbers, could be of benefit here. The ELDR Group regrets that the arms embargo is not being extended. There is still a hotbed of tension and human rights are still being violated. As such, the General Affairs Council fails to observe our own European criteria for an arms embargo. The European Union’s decision is playing into the hands of the military and this is exactly what should not happen.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, after Egypt, Turkey and the Middle East in general, Christians in Asia now find themselves being bullied and subjected to acts of violence and murder. It is time to express our absolute repugnance at these dreadful events.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The message of the religions of the book, however, is clear, simple and positive. It is inconceivable that it should be hijacked to justify such horrors. Through slow and regular pressure, Islam has already driven most eastern Christians into exile. What are we doing in practical terms to support them? A whole galaxy of associations, in France and in Europe, is trying to come to their assistance so that exile is not the only option left open to them. I congratulate them most sincerely.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What impoverishment and what a loss for these countries. The Christians who have lived in these countries since well before the expansion of Islam also form the cultural roots of these countries. Admittedly, in the Moluccas, the situation is different, as the Indonesian government is trying, unsuccessfully, to control the situation, although it is evidently unable to control its own armed forces, hence the importance of not lifting the arms embargo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is to be feared that once again through their blood the Christians will serve as a scapegoat for crises that overtake them. The crisis of the Indonesian State has deep-seated economic, social and political roots as well as religious ones. Our Group therefore expresses its absolute horror at what is happening in the Moluccas, as it did at what happened in East Timor, and its great concern about the fate of Christians in the Middle East, and now in Asia.</p>

    <intervention id="4-167" speaker_id="4507" name="Belder" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, President Wahid continues to deny that the conflict in the Moluccas has taken on crisis proportions. According to him, the religious violence is generated by a violent minority, the so-called ‘dark forces’, who keep breathing new life into the conflict.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Recent images and reports, however, seem to contradict this. The gravity of the situation is illustrated by the large-scale arson attacks on churches and mosques and the repeated appeals for a holy war, jihad. The spreading of the violence to Lombok and Sulawesi is also great cause for concern. The mutual bloodshed in the Moluccas has now lasted for a year.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is, of course, tempting to track down those directly responsible for such a conflict. The Indonesian press is heavily involved in this activity. Whether this will really contribute to solving the conflict very much remains to be seen. At present, it even seems that the media are, in fact, feeding the violence. Their reports are quite frequently the cause for new attacks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Apart from the press, the army is also playing a dubious role. Both Muslims and Christians have levelled accusations against the army. Wahid has attempted to restore control over the army, but he has not been entirely successful. It seems unwise, therefore, to lift the arms embargo against Indonesia for the time being.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The common resolution calls on the Council, the Commission and Parliament to help resolve the conflicts in Indonesia via delegations. Needless to say, we cannot barge in and prescribe a number of solutions. Within Indonesian society, ethnic and religious minorities and all other social operators must help in the construction of a civil society. Humanitarian aid must be provided as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Commission shares the view expressed by the Parliament in its motion for a resolution, both with regard to the firm commitment by the Indonesian government to promote democracy and the respect for human rights, and the need to support the Indonesian government in its efforts to limit the violence and restore human rights in the province of the Moluccas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to peaceful negotiations as an instrument to restore peace between the Muslim and Christian communities, the Commission is convinced that the current situation, worrying as it is, requires an effort by the international community. It is in this spirit that we should support the Indonesian government and avoid any reaction of a punitive nature.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The latest statement by the presidency, on 17 January, precisely reflects this attitude and, on behalf of Commissioner Patten, I can assure you that the Commission endorses the ideas expressed in the statement. Nevertheless, the General Affairs Council, which is to meet on Monday, 24 January, will provide an opportunity to examine Parliament’s request.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the imminent visit of the Indonesian president to Brussels and other European capitals will provide an opportunity to assure him and his government of our willingness to make every effort necessary to resolve this situation peacefully.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, anyone who follows the urgent debate in this Parliament will realise that the history of Europe appears to be returning to haunt us. That is to say that, in the previous debate on the Moluccas, we heard a lot of Dutch and now I fear that the Commissioner is going to hear a lot of Spanish, because we are talking about Venezuela. What is happening is that the history of Europe is returning to haunt us. The Europeans who went and occupied the world, now, in a sense, are influenced by what is happening elsewhere, and therefore, when we speak, although – especially for the Commissioner – this may seem like a litany of complaints, we are in fact expressing the opinion of the voters. Specifically in my country, Spain, and in the region I come from – the Canary Islands – the catastrophe in Venezuela has been felt as if it had happened in our own country.</p>
      <p sl="es">My regret is that, at the moment, Mr Busquin, who is a great Commissioner and a great politician, and who is in a position to understand these problems, is not, in fact, the Commissioner responsible for the matter, because he probably already has a written answer and anything I say is not going to influence his reply, because I am sure he is not able to change that reply. I do hope, however, that he will at least read the motion for a resolution and take note of some of the issues which concern us.</p>
      <p sl="es">The disaster in Venezuela has not been an ordinary disaster. We are talking about the disappearance of 50 000 people – in reality, the death of 50 000 people – the disappearance of a state – the state of Vargas – where the Maiquetía airport and the port of La Guaira are located, which is the entrance or ‘hall’ of Venezuela. That state must be rebuilt and it must be done in a way which will prevent any further disaster. The disaster did not happen as a result of mere negligence on the part of the authorities. It happened as a result of the collapse of an entire ridge – the ridge of the Ávila National Park – and therefore this will have to be taken into account in its reconstruction.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that the Commission will take Parliament’s considerations into account and will consider the possibility of organising some type of ‘conference of donors’, or something of the sort, with other organisations and states so that, amongst all of us, we can help the Venezuelan government to reconstruct a very important part of the country.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-173" speaker_id="1868" name="Sánchez García" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, for we citizens who live in the Canary Islands, one of the European Union’s outermost regions, everything that happens in Venezuela affects us significantly, since thousands of people from the Canary Islands had to emigrate to that country in the middle of the last century, and in that respect we regard Venezuela as our eighth island.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, we have been greatly affected by this disaster in Venezuela, in the states of Vargas and Miranda, in the middle of last December, as a result of torrential rain, avalanches and floods on the Venezuelan coast, at the foot of Ávila, a national park where I have had the opportunity to work professionally. The human losses were high, as well as the number of injuries, while the material loss amounts to thousands of millions of euros.</p>
      <p sl="es">We all reacted to the enormity of the disaster, from Europe and from America, with humanitarian aid and economic support, with exemplary solidarity, that is to say, there was a speedy international response on all levels, including the European Commission, certain Member States and some Spanish communities having family ties with Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having overcome this initial phase, and despite other natural dangers over recent days, it has become more necessary than ever to rehabilitate and reconstruct the damaged housing, facilities and infrastructures – as well as to make the relevant hydrological corrections – and to support the victims of this natural disaster, both morally and economically, since this disaster is one of the most serious tragedies to have hit Latin America, and Venezuela in particular, in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="es">For these reasons, we have all presented a motion for a resolution aimed at producing, basically on the part of the European Union, a technical and financial cooperation plan, amongst other things, in coordination with the Member States and other institutions, which will provide relief and compensation for the effects of this natural disaster. I can guarantee that, on this occasion, the disaster in Venezuela has genuinely become a ‘topical and urgent subject of major importance’.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-174" speaker_id="1875" name="González Álvarez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe that the real tragedy is that we so often have to speak about the different catastrophes which lay waste to certain parts of the world more often than others, and also perhaps countries which, since they are affected by greater poverty and weaker infrastructures, pay a much higher price than if they were stronger. And the same can be said of their citizens, because in the case of Venezuela there are – as in the case of the ‘Mitch’ disaster – numerous fatal casualties.</p>
      <p sl="es">Naturally, we are asking the European institutions to provide economic aid – which they have already provided; they have proposed EUR 3 500 000 to help with immediate expenses – but we are also asking them to cooperate in other ways with the Government and citizens of Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="es">This very week we have discussed a disaster which happened in Europe and we mentioned – and many experts confirm this – that climate change could have something to do with the continual proliferation of disasters wrongly described as ‘natural’. We believe that man has something to do with it.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the case of Venezuela – we had the opportunity to go there for the Conference between the European Parliament and the Latin American Parliament –rampant urbanisation and attacks on the environment, which perhaps exacerbate these situations, are clearly visible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Mr President, we have to attend to the urgent need to rebuild all the infrastructures. The European institutions, the Member countries and certain non-governmental organisations must cooperate with other countries, so that the effects of this catastrophe, which has caused irreversible damage, can be alleviated as much as possible.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-175" speaker_id="4378" name="Knörr Borràs" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I do not wish to be rendered superfluous by what previous speakers have said. I also come from an area, the Basque Country, where there is a great sense of solidarity, due to the fact that Venezuela is a country which has received immigrants from the whole of Spain and the Basque Country in particular, and which, during the long years of Franco’s dictatorship, lent us inestimable moral and material support.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, as we say, “it never rains but it pours”; in recent days we have discovered that there has been an earthquake which measured 6 on the Richter Scale as well as a tidal wave.</p>
      <p sl="es">Since we all share this sense of solidarity and condolence, I would also like to talk about certain aspects which go beyond material aid in the short term and the resolution itself. We should examine the model of development, not only in Venezuela but also in other countries, bringing it more into line with the need to preserve and respect the environment. We also need to provide aid for the study of these aspects and the negative influence which certain industrial sectors have on the environmental balance, and not only in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should hold a European Union-Latin America Conference in order to reverse the tendency towards dependency on, and the exportation of, energy resources, as well as the blind exploitation of those resources. We should do everything necessary to prevent these catastrophes.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, we must turn our attention to all these points and also – of course – to the points appearing in the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I do not wish to miss this opportunity to also draw your attention to the claims of human rights violations in Venezuela under the pretext of taking action against looting in the areas affected. We cannot close our eyes to this either. Our solidarity with the Venezuelan people must not lead us to lower our guard in the monitoring of individuals such as President Chávez, a populist President who has shown worrying signs of intolerance and threats to various sectors, including the media, although some European leaders are willing to ‘laugh at his jokes’.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-176" speaker_id="4452" name="Marques" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">For over 300 000 of my compatriots, Venezuela is a land of opportunity for a better life which has welcomed them with open arms. The same has happened with hundreds of thousands of other European emigrants. As a matter of fact, over 70% of the Portuguese immigrants in Venezuela have come from my region of Madeira.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This close link means that we have watched this disaster unfold with much sadness and emotion. It has also generated a great feeling of solidarity and it was therefore very pleasing to hear the Commission announce the provision of humanitarian aid. However, the extent of the tragedy which is now apparent has demonstrated the inadequacy of this aid. Venezuela is facing the greatest natural disaster to have occurred in Latin America in the twentieth century. We already know that at least 15 000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have lost their homes. The physical damage is estimated at between USD 10 and 20 billion and 230 000 jobs have been lost.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In view of these incredible and tragic figures, the European Union must substantially increase its show of solidarity with Venezuela. This is why I have tabled a motion for a resolution in this House. The European Parliament, as the representative of the people of Europe, must show its grief and its solidarity. Parliament must also encourage the Commission to increase the humanitarian aid in order to meet the overwhelming needs in areas such as medical care, water, public health, food and so on. We also propose that the Commission prepares a medium-term action plan for the reconstruction of the infrastructure and housing given that the recovery of the affected area could take more than seven years. This plan must also encourage and stimulate the resumption of economic activities through financial incentives, subsidised loans and specialised assistance. We also call on the Commission to make every effort to mobilise the means needed to carry out these actions. We must not be satisfied with good intentions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the least that we can do for the victims of these floods.</p>

    <intervention id="4-177" speaker_id="2002" name="Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe that the European Union would be making a grave error if it were to underestimate the extent of this tragedy in Venezuela, as a result of which, as has been pointed out here, thousands of people have lost their lives. It is all very well to express our solidarity, but it is important and urgent that we turn words into actions.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Community’s response must include a broad plan for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country, which will have various facets: reinforcing humanitarian and emergency aid and the establishment of additional lines for rehabilitation and reconstruction. I say ‘additional’ because the Council of Ministers will approve a declaration next Monday on the basis of an agreement between the Ambassadors in COREPER, which states that an effort will be made using existing resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is impossible for ‘Mitch’ resources to be used to finance this priority. What this Parliament is asking for – and it is doing so also as an arm of the budgetary authority – is that the Commission make an ambitious proposal which responds to the situation which has arisen.</p>
      <p sl="es">It would also be a good thing for the Commission to examine the possibilities presented by the application of commercial measures, within the framework provided by the Community system of generalised preferences, and an increase and extension of credits by the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union should also support the ‘international conference of donors’, as proof of its solidarity and cooperation with Venezuela, a friend of the European Union, and in order to satisfy the expectations of a people that is suffering.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-178" speaker_id="1258" name="Linkohr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, if you compare the damaged area of Venezuela to Germany, then it is as if our entire coastal region had been destroyed and 200 000 people had lost their lives. That illustrates the huge scale of this disaster for a country like Venezuela. I am not being macabre when I say that the best thing which could happen to Venezuela right now would be soaring oil prices, so that it could finance as much as possible itself. Unpleasant because expensive for us, to be sure, but advantageous to Venezuela. In this respect, Venezuela is in a better position after all the damage which it has suffered than central America was after hurricane Mitch.</p>
      <p sl="de">But that is poor consolation in the face of the huge devastation. The demand for an international donor conference with the active participation of the Commission therefore makes sense. For the rest I, like the other Members, am waiting for the Commission to submit a plan to us as quickly as possible as to how it can help here, in agreement with the Venezuelan government.</p>
      <p sl="de">Venezuela can count on our sympathy, but it also needs money, imagination and help to rebuild. Allow me to add that globalisation does not just mean trade, it also means solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is also reasonable after such a devastating catastrophe to inquire into the causes. I fear that we will have to deal with more and more natural disasters in which people are partly to blame. Of course, people are powerless in the face of a natural change of climate, but then greenhouse gases are also part of the equation. That is where the problem lies. Unfortunately, Europe is not honouring its Kyoto commitments. I hope that this disaster and, unfortunately others, will give us cause to consider and to take measures so that we do not always have to talk of catastrophes every time there is an emergency and can perhaps also discuss what preventative action can be taken to avoid disasters on this scale. If that is nature’s way, at least we should not have a part in it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the Members of Parliament on the dreadful situation in Venezuela and I will inform Mr Nielson of your various comments. In view of the extent of the disaster, the Commission reacted immediately, adopting decisions on 23 and 30 December 1999. These have already been implemented to grant EUR 3.2 million of humanitarian aid. However, in view of the immediate need to make an assessment of the needs, an expert from the ECHO Humanitarian Office went to Venezuela on 22 December. An ECHO permanent correspondent will go there in the next few days to coordinate the humanitarian aid and to be responsible for implementing the programmes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In view of the increased risk of epidemics of cholera and leprosy, among other things, as confirmed by the Venezuelan Minister of Health, the Commission is preparing a third decision in respect of EUR 2 million to restore a drinking water system and epidemiological monitoring. I share Mr Linkohr’s view of the advisability of having a general discussion in future on disasters and some studies are contributing towards this. Apart from the Commission, of course, the international community has responded quickly and generously to the appeal launched by the government. According to the Humanitarian aid Coordination Office of the United Nations, the total amount of aid now amounts to about 24 million dollars, almost 10 million of which is from the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Responding to the wishes of Parliament, the Commission is, however, also preparing an appraisal mission to assess the situation in Venezuela and to identify specific measures. According to the results of this mission, it will adopt a medium term reconstruction programme. The Commission will pay particular attention to environmental matters when implementing the restoration measures. At this stage, we are not in a position to state the amount of aid that will be determined according to the results of the expert appraisal and consultation with other donors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will cooperate closely with the other donors to encourage coordination of efforts by the international community and the definition of priority measures. It is therefore essential for a system to be set up as soon as possible to coordinate international aid.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0039/99) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to the Commission, on a balanced strategy for the internal market and the legal protection of consumers.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-195" speaker_id="1995" name="Palacio Vallelersundi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, the luxury of time allows me to try to teach by example: Once upon a time, before the advent of the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was a Council which was debating an amendment of the Brussels and Lugano Convention: not for them the mysteries of the technical questions: it was a judicial problem. In other words, before which judge does one have to raise one’s concerns in the event of a transnational dispute. The Council, unanimously and within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation, that is to say, with very little sense of Community, very close to international public law, had arrived at an agreement in principle. But, lo and behold, the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force and, in accordance with Article 65, it became necessary to communitise that amendment of the Brussels and Lugano Treaty and to turn that new convention into a Community instrument: a regulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Then the Commission entered the scene and, very promptly, and in order to take initial advantage of the new Treaty of Amsterdam, decided that the communitisation of an instrument was simply a case of changing its title: instead of calling it a convention, you call it a regulation. And that is that.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thus, the Commission, with no prior consultation, with no consultation amongst the various Directorates-General, presented a draft regulation on these judicial questions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, in this Parliament, a report is being presented – still simply an opinion, since in this field Parliament still only has limited powers – drawn up by Mrs Diana Wallis, who I hope will speak on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">From this – and my story ends here – we must draw some conclusions:</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, there is a lack of coordination in the Council, because the Council does not mean the Council. It means the Council in its “Justice” form. And I will go further; it takes the form of experts, of professors of international private law, who are the people who have been negotiating the international treaties which, at the end of the day, deal with this specific question. There had been no consultation with the Internal Market Council or the General Affairs Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">Also, however, and this is more important for the future, there has been a lack of coordination on the part of the Commission. It is true that it was experiencing very difficult times – it had resigned – but there was a lack of coordination in the end because the hearing on this issue took place after the publication of the proposed regulation, in violation of the most basic principles of efficiency and also respect for the citizens and this House, as well as other issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, I believe that this example illustrates the difficult and demanding situation, or challenge – as you wish, Mr President – which we are facing: internal market principles, principles of international private law. That is to say, does the communitisation of an instrument, which will have to happen often, simply mean saying regulation instead of convention? The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market believes that this cannot be the case and I hope that Parliament will take the same view.</p>
      <p sl="es">The communitisation of an instrument, first and foremost, means the screening of each of the regulatory proposals with respect to the founding principles of the internal market, in particular, the principle of mutual recognition and the principle of control in the State where it originated.</p>
      <p sl="es">In reality, communitisation means having respect for the internal market. This is important because, at the moment, completing the internal market means dealing with that border country which surrounds the regulations already in force and which, because they are rooted in procedural law and, of course, in many areas of international private law, lack clear definition. Therefore, if we lose the principles which guide the internal market, we are indirectly emptying it of its substance and heading for extreme danger.</p>
      <p sl="es">And to this we can add another danger. In this age of digital revolution, we may tend to say, ‘We are global. The internal market has become too small. Let us regulate on a world scale. What is the internal market for? Let us go beyond the internal market’. Let us remember that European integration has been built on the internal market and that, furthermore, we are obliged by a Treaty to respect the principles which sustain and shape this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">“What about the consumers?”, you may ask. Well, in the example I gave, it appears that the intention is to protect consumers by offering them the opportunity to seek justice with the judge next door, their local judge. Will this protect them? I am afraid not. The evidence lies in the fact that consumers do not consider filing claims when they buy a small item, when they buy something from the local shop. Why? Because it is very expensive and long-winded. That is to say, if we want to protect consumers, we need to adopt measures, for example, the two measures presented by the Commission, the small claims procedure or the extrajudicial settlement of consumer disputes. This protects consumers: quick, cheap and effective procedures.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, Mr President, protecting consumers also means treating them as adults, not thinking of them as being incapable of making a choice. I believe that, at the moment, one of the great challenges facing Europe in this digital revolution is to change the culture and principles of consumer protection. We have to protect consumers, but protect them in deed, rather than in word, and we have to accept a culture of risk, a calculated risk for the consumer. In other words, they must be able to make fully-informed choices.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will end, Mr President. Europe must defend its values, but Europe has another great challenge; the balance between public legislation and self regulation. In order to defend consumers, we need a solid and protective framework of public legislation, but we also need to create an area where we can establish systems stemming from civil society which are more in accordance with our times than those which stem from the public institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">The other day, at the Madrid Summit, somebody said to me, “Mrs Palacio, on the Internet, one year becomes two months. A directive which takes you four years is too slow”. Let us be quicker, let us maintain our values but, of course, let us remember that our internal market must be a priority.</p>

    <intervention id="4-196" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Bolkestein" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the honourable MEP, Mrs Palacio, for giving me the opportunity of elaborating upon a matter which is extremely important but also extremely complex. I would like to say the following on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Like Mrs Palacio, with a view to bringing about an area without internal borders pursuant to Article 2 EC, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the principle that enterprises need to be able to make their goods and services available throughout the Union without the Member State of destination imposing discriminating and unjustified obstructions. Indeed, these obstructions can lead to the fragmentation of the internal market because enterprises need to bring their goods or services into line with the regulations of all European Union countries where they are active.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is our point of departure which is shared by Mrs Palacio who, in fact, stated just now that the European Union is based on the internal market. The Commission could not agree more with Mrs Palacio. However, the condition under which the principle of mutual recognition can be wholly accepted is that all Member States have an appropriate and comparable level of consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the proposal brought by the honourable MEP for a directive on certain legal aspects of e-commerce, it is expressly stated that the term “internal market” in Article 3 does not include commitments arising from consumer agreements. As Mrs Palacio is aware, commitments made in consumer agreements are governed by the Convention of Rome and, as such, do not fall within the scope of the e-commerce directive on which political agreement was reached in the Council on 7 December last.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to the recent initiatives taken by the Commission in the framework of the new Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community, I assume that Mrs Palacio – as she, in fact, put into words just now – particularly refers to the draft regulation which the Commission approved in July 1999, further to the activities of an ad hoc group of the Council and after political agreement by the fifteen Member States, the aim of this draft regulation being to incorporate the Treaty of Brussels of 1968 concerning legislative power and the recognition and execution of decisions in civil and commercial affairs, into derived Community legislation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mrs Palacio mentioned this a minute ago and criticised the way in which the regulation proposed by the Commission has come into being. She also stated that there was little consultation, not only between Commission and Parliament, but even among the different Councils.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission has proposed amendments to the original treaty dating back to 1968 in order to bring this – it has to be said – old treaty into line with modern trading methods and, in particular, e-commerce. The honourable MEP now seems to be of the opinion that the points of departure of the draft regulation, which should communitise the Treaty of Brussels, would contravene the principle of the country of origin. This would mean, however, if she were right, that the judiciary would also come under the scope of this principle, which is not the case. Moreover, article 1 of the aforementioned draft directive on e-commerce stipulates, as has been established by political agreement in December, that this draft does not pertain to the issue of the judiciary. As Mrs Palacio is aware, the issue of the judiciary falls under the scope of the Convention of Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So, the present situation embraces three separate components. There is the draft directive on e-commerce. There is the Rome Convention, to which I referred just now, and there is the Brussels Convention. These are three components which, at the moment, are juxtaposed, yet independent of each other. Mr President, the Commission will ensure that due consideration is given to the objections lodged during the hearing of 4 and 5 November, on the possible effects this draft regulation will have on the internal market, and to the statements received in favour of the draft. The Commission is in the process of analysing the numerous and detailed positions it has received and will announce its proposals, if any, in due course.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, it would seem useful, in any event, especially in the light of the points of criticism brought by Mrs Palacio, that the Commission, before taking any initiative, should be informed of the position which the European Parliament will be taking in February of this year.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It also seems necessary to me that appropriate, additional solutions should be found in order to eliminate the objections raised during the hearing by the consumer representatives. This is why it is important that negotiations take place involving all interested parties in order to find alternatives, as requested by Mrs Palacio, to the often lengthy, costly and complex judicial procedures, and this with a view to settling cross-border disputes following e-commerce transactions swiftly and with less expense for the consumer.</p>

    <intervention id="4-197" speaker_id="4538" name="Harbour" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, can I say first of all how much I welcome what Mr Bolkestein has just said about the Commission taking a very thorough look at all the complex and intersecting pieces of legislation that are going to affect the new world in which we are living – the new world of electronic commerce.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was fortunate enough to be able to attend part of the hearings on 4 and 5 November and the numbers of people involved and the quality of the contributions show how seriously people were taking this issue. That is a reflection of the concern that was felt about the initial approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">My colleague, Mrs Wallis, who is preparing our report, will be speaking later and I do not want to anticipate or steal her thunder. We will be discussing that later and I know, Commissioner, you will have seen some elements of it already. The point I want to make is not from a lawyer's perspective, because I am privileged on the Committee on Legal Affairs, under Mrs Palacio’s chairmanship, to be one of the few people who are not lawyers. I should like to put forward a perspective about the issues from the point of view of both business and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The key word in this question that we pose to you, Commissioner, is balance. If we look around the world, the advent of electronic commerce or electronic communications is significantly changing the balance of the marketplace. The balance is moving strongly in favour of consumers. We are all becoming empowered consumers because that new communications technology is giving us enormous power to shop globally, to compare prices, to make our decisions on the basis of large amounts of easily accessible information. Those of you who have not experienced that should certainly do so because electronic commerce, because of this combination of computing power and information, is allowing people to compare offers and shop in a way they have never done before.</p>
      <p sl="en">I give you a simple illustration. It is one that is relevant to what we are doing in legislation in the whole public sector. The office of telecommunications in the United Kingdom has a website where consumers can go and compare the details offered by all the different telecommunications companies. You put in the details of your telephone usage and you compare the different offers – that is the sort of power we will soon have available to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">This new generation of empowered consumers is not going to be concerned about arguments that we might have as legislators about principles of justice and applicable law because, as Mrs Palacio pointed out, access to the courts is not uppermost in the minds of most people who shop, on the Internet or anywhere else. Before making a decision about a purchase, customers are going to want to be confident that the organisation they are dealing with provides strong conditions and guarantees and access to redress. If it is a relatively unfamiliar brand – and we should be encouraging small companies to use electronic commerce to make offers to consumers – those consumers may well want the security of some sort of approved mark, an E-trader mark, such as that, for example, which the British Consumer's Association is promoting very successfully. We shall give them great credit for that.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the sort of initiative we need to be encouraging across the European Union. That is something I would ask the Commissioner to take up as part of this whole range of issues associated with consumer legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">People will want to deal with organisations that handle problems and complaints with the same speed and efficiency with which they made their purchase on the Internet. They will want simple and effective redress and access to someone who will sort out their problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one certainty about electronic commerce and that is that it moves very fast indeed. New formats of product and service are brought to market much more quickly than ever before and our job as legislators in this Parliament is to encourage that dynamism and not to slow it down. We want to encourage consumers to use electronic information in their shopping decisions, and to encourage firms of every size, particularly the small enterprises, to participate in electronic commerce. That is clearly going to require us to rethink our regulatory framework.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-198" speaker_id="2285" name="Berger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, we are conducting a debate here today on a balanced strategy for the internal market and legal protection for consumers on the basis of an oral question which deals mainly with the opposite of the principle of the country of origin in the internal market and the principle of the country of destination in consumer protection. Such contractions are unavoidable in oral questions. But I think, and the debate so far has already demonstrated as much, that discussion of these two principles is not getting us anywhere, especially when we are talking about a suitable legal framework for electronic commerce. It is rightly feared, and I acknowledge this, that the possibility for consumers to sue under their national law before the courts in their country of residence may have a hindering or even a deterrent effect on the establishment of electronic commerce. At the same time, however, we also know that this possibility of suing in the national courts is often only theoretical and is rarely enforced.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we can hardly expect consumers to go to court in the supplier’s country of origin, since suppliers would then establish themselves in the Member States which offered the least consumer protection and had the weakest consumer laws. That will certainly not boost the confidence of consumers which electronic commerce needs if it is to develop.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore believe that the new article 15 in the regulation submitted, either as it stands or with its restriction to offline transactions, really helps us. What we need are systems for settling disputes out of court and procedures to deal with small claims quickly. I therefore expressly welcome the measures proposed by the Commission in its communication on the future strategy, especially support for initiatives for online procedures to settle disputes out of court and for a new Green Paper on access to the law and legal redress for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think, however, that it should be possible to develop secure electronic monetary transactions and remittance systems in conjunction with the European banks and the credit card companies which allow concurrent electronic transactions. Even enhanced cooperation with consumer protection organisations and cross-border authority for these consumer protection organisations may, in the final analysis, be more helpful on a daily basis than a theoretical dispute between the principle of the country of destination and the principle of the country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to expressly emphasise, following the criticism of the Commission’s proposals for the new draft regulation, that I consider the Commission’s approach to be the right one. Article 13 of the convention already regulates the place of jurisdiction for consumers and the majority of legal scholars have already expressed the view that this also applies to online transactions. The Commission is not therefore changing any aspect of the present legal situation. As we all know, Article 95, paragraph 3 requires the Commission to start from a high level of consumer protection for all its proposals.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore believe that the Commission has acted rightly with its proposal. We, the Socialist Group, also support the proposals made by Mrs Wallis in the Committee on Legal Affairs; she has proposed a number of amendments to the draft regulation but also insists on supplementing the existing system by introducing additional procedures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I should like to say on behalf of my Group that we would only consider switching to the principle of the country of origin if the legal protection of consumers is strengthened by additional procedures granting them the possibility of legal protection.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-199" speaker_id="4544" name="Wallis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this question highlights the tension between business and consumer interests in the context of the single market – a tension, I have to say, that I have become all too familiar with as rapporteur on the Brussels Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The idea of coordination has been mentioned. I want to draw attention to an approach, or perhaps a buzz phrase, if you like, that is much used in the UK at the moment in relation to government. We talk about joined-up thinking or joined-up administration. In other words, bridging gaps between departments. This is also a sign of maturity, graduating, as we do at school, from writing in single letters to joined up writing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The debate on jurisdiction and e-commerce has highlighted this conflict between consumers and web traders. Can a consumer bring an action in his own court if he is entitled to do so? Will this be the death blow to e-commerce?</p>
      <p sl="en">I propose a package of measures central to which is the theme of access to justice, much trumpeted at Tampere.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now if the single market is to function properly – to be fully and confidently exploited both by small businesses and consumers – there must be access to justice in civil matters. There must be small claims procedures and alternative dispute resolution. This is absolutely integral to the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, of course, our Commissioner will say that this is perhaps more the preserve of his colleague, Mr Vitorino, and perhaps also Mr Byrne. This has been my frustration. There are speeches and statements by Mr Byrne and Mr Vitorino in favour of setting up systems to deal with European small claims. We have to bring these statements together. The Commission has to start thinking in a joined-up way – as a joined-up administration. We have a once in a generation opportunity to facilitate the growth of e-commerce.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the secondary theme, we tend to be drawn towards harmonisation as a means of resolving some of these problems – of resolving the tensions we face. But it is often that process of harmonisation, which can depend too much on legislation, that can be rigid and inflexible and then itself turn into a barrier against the single market. There are such allegations concerning the data protection directive, which is an important piece of consumer protection legislation, but in some Member States it seems to have been over-implemented, resulting in a potential barrier within the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">E-commerce is very much a global market. The solutions we adopt have to allow our citizens and businesses to participate in this wider market. In America, which need not necessarily to be our role model – they have adopted a combination of self-regulation and soft law backed by legislation. We should be prepared to look at this sort of mixture of solutions. One has already been mentioned. One of the possible solutions may lie in the hands of the credit card industry. But to take advantage of these, we must act and the Commission must act together in a joined-up manner.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-200" speaker_id="4548" name="MacCormick" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Palacio and Commissioner Bolkestein for starting this discussion with typical lucidity and courtesy.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is remarkable – and though it may be banal to say it, I cannot forbear to make the point – what a huge change the development of e-commerce is going to have on the way we all live in the coming decades and throughout this century. Speaking for myself, I did my first Christmas e-shopping this past Christmas, partly because of the new circumstances of my life and the lesser availability of the high street shops of Edinburgh to me at present. Indeed, I sent some e-flowers to my daughter on her recent marriage in Texas, and – as you will appreciate, Mr President – it was agreeable to a Scotsman to get the flowers there without the cost of a fare! We are moving into a new world. But there are, as has been said, extraordinarily difficult problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you move away from the own-country basis, small firms will have difficulty getting into the market. Mrs Berger made a part of the point, but is it not important to remember that people who are getting into a trade need to know what they have to insure against, and local advice on that is going to be better. It makes it important that the home country principle prevails. But then the opposite problem arises. You can get long-distance rip-offs from companies in other countries that know that they are not at much risk of facing angry Mrs Smith who got a dud article through the mail. So how do you deal with that?</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been mentioned twice already – and it is an important suggestion – that there should be ways in which you can use the credit card companies as a risk-spreading mechanism if they are willing to participate in this. Consumers can have rights against the credit card company in their own country, and the credit card company can have rights against the producer or seller in its country. That way, all those involved in the market would participate in a very small way in the risks across the whole market. The Commission should be looking at that.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the long term though, we must move to a harmonisation of laws in civil and commercial matters throughout the Union. We in the UK, as you know, Mr President, ran a very successful internal market for 300 years, with two legal systems which grew together spontaneously, not by imposition. We need, in the long run, to look for that kind of development in Europe. We should have European restatements like the American restatements and let our law evolve.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-201" speaker_id="4746" name="Berlato" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to outline the position reached by Mr Nobilia and myself, both of us members of a special group within the UEN Group.</p>
      <p sl="it">We believe that the issue raised by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi is, perhaps, one of the main problems that the internal market must face. Regulations in this area are flawed and inappropriate, and instead of providing overall operational certainty and uniform legal protection of the consumer, they leave much room for groundless discretion and uncertainty. This is certainly the case as regards the subject the questioner gave as an example – e-commerce – and along with this, sales procedures, purchasers’ rights, their option to withdraw and, at the same time, varying levels of tax levied on the sale itself. However, this issue also affects numerous other areas: the electronic components sector – as a further example – where production might take place in several countries, including ones not in the Union, with storage and/or the affixing of the trademark in one Member State and final assembly in yet another Member State. Moreover, the problem is not so much the reliability of the individual components or their compliance with the legislation of the importing or producing state as their overall conformity with the notion of greater flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union firmly supports this view, especially if the countries of residence of the end consumers have, with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of the economic operators operating in Europe, attributed specific characteristics to the product on the basis of clear and pre-determined characteristics and ones which, in any case, supplement those established by the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">The concept I have just explained is clearly illustrated by the agri-food sector where, with particular regard to place of origin and following derogations granted on this matter to the Member States, there is greater focus on the information which features on the label of the product intended for final sale.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear that such a situation not only leads to uncertainty, but at the same time distorts competition to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses, not through proper compliance with the relevant national law but because of the fewer opportunities accorded to them precisely because of the shortcomings of Community legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also clear that the persistence of such a disadvantage for small and medium-sized businesses gives rise to fears of repercussions on employment which, in this specific case, cannot be allayed by simplifying administrative procedures, reducing set-up costs or involving the social partners and their resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">All of this means that, as well as drafting various regulations on the issues raised and on specific matters relating to this area, we must also consolidate the requisite overall view and the legislative philosophy that serves as a real means of regulating the internal market and which provides an effective point of reference for the Member States and for every economic operator.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, we believe that, in addition to the monitoring of fragmentation performed by the Commission – truly praiseworthy work as far as the process of the approximation of national laws is concerned – we must make every effort to ensure a more correct assimilation and a more accurate translation of the mandate conferred by the Council of Vienna, which was subsequently confirmed with specific regard to the internal market, with the aim of improving the European legal reference framework and that for competition, alongside the elimination of barriers to trade and the improvement of services.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-202" speaker_id="1969" name="Blokland" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the oral question of the Committee on Legal Affairs regarding possible barriers to trade which may arise due to consumer legislation has, in the meantime, been resolved as far as they are concerned: further harmonisation. But is this really necessary?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The internal market has ensured that manufacturers and consumers can cross borders more easily. Adequate legislation needs to be in place for these cross-border transactions. This is why minimum harmonisation of legislation is necessary. A high level of consumer protection does not mean that we have to regulate everything at European level through maximum harmonisation. Quite the reverse, in fact. We need to seek the best possible solution for the consumer, in this case a trusted frame of reference. This will frequently be a national framework.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the case of e-commerce, the country of origin in the Union can be chosen more or less at random. This does not add to consumer confidence. This is why consumers must be given the choice to opt for the legislation of their own country. The objection that this would lead to unwanted barriers to trade seems incorrect to me. Consumer protection creates a necessary, politically desirable pre-condition for trade, designed to protect the weaker party.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In any case, the Commission’s approach does not lead to an endless tussle regarding the desirable level of harmonisation. Neither does it require new legislation at EU or national level and it respects the principle of subsidiarity. There is nothing unbalanced about the Commission’s strategy. At the outside, there may be something unbalanced about the strategy of the Committee on Legal Affairs which is endlessly hammering away about communitisation, using arguments which seem false to me.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-203" speaker_id="1122" name="Oomen-Ruijten" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, top priority for the European Commission, but also top priority for European industry and trade is electronic trade, or e-commerce. We must not forget that consumers too greatly benefit from being able to use e-commerce well. But what are we faced with now? A fierce discussion between industry and consumers about the legislation which applies in the case of cross-border trade which is increasingly taking place electronically. Suppliers of products and services support the home country principle according to which the legislation of the country where the supplier is based applies. I can understand that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, take an example. If you, as a Portuguese citizen, buy a computer via the Internet from a supplier in Finland – by the way, the Finns have sound consumer protection – the home country principle will apply according to Finnish law. The expensive computer, however, does not arrive whilst you have already paid for it by credit card. Would this Portuguese person like to start a court case in Finland? I do not think so. This would mean that you would also need to obtain legal advice in Finland or about Finnish legislation. But, Mr Bolkestein, there is more. More than what you have mentioned because the European consumer is protected by more rules than just legislation on e-commerce or the regulations you just mentioned. There is also a directive on ‘distance selling’. A directive on ‘financial services’ is under way. There is also a privacy directive. These contain minimum guarantees, sometimes maximum guarantees, for the consumer. The proposed legislation on e-commerce adds a number of extra measures to these.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Two different Commission proposals have also been tabled in this regard. It is difficult, however, to know where to turn for legal protection. On the one hand, there is e-commerce which is based on the home country principle and, on the other, there is the proposal for this new, adapted Brussels regulation. Although – and I agree with Mr Bolkestein on this – it is quite possible to combine both proposals to the letter, the underlying idea is definitely contradictory. So this leads to confusion, and the legal protection accompanying e-commerce therefore faces teething problems. Mr President, in my opinion, we as the European Parliament are also liable for arranging proper consumer protection. After all, the consumer benefits from a transparent and consistent system of legal protection because, without consumer confidence, e-commerce cannot really come into its own and take off completely. We must, therefore, in my opinion, more so than we have done so far, consider what the alternatives are for offering legal protection to consumers, even when something goes wrong. Then I think, and this is why I call upon Commissioner Bolkestein, that we should take a much better look at the alternative systems for settling disputes. As you know, the Netherlands boasts a finely tuned system of alternative dispute settlements which, in fact, could also work on a cross-border basis, where the Conciliation Committees Foundation already enables people from abroad to lodge objections with this Foundation in The Hague. Justice is also administered there.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, one of the solutions is to find a different course.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, allow me to start by thanking Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for the initiative on the oral question. What is at issue here? The subject can be summed up in the following catchwords: consumer protection and electronic commerce in a force field. Or, to put it another way: how can consumers in the European Union be efficiently protected without hampering the development of e-commerce? The discussion is focusing at present on the question of the principle to be used to determine the place of jurisdiction and, subsequently, the applicable law in the event of cross-border disputes in electronic commerce.</p>
      <p sl="de">Must a consumer enforce his rights before the court in the country in which the supplier of the goods or services is established or in the country in which he lives? Which law applies? I do not want to address the pros and cons of this question again today. We are all sufficiently familiar with them. The Commission held a hearing on this in November. I should just like to point out today that, in my view, the discussion of consumer protection on the one side and e-commerce business on the other has been too narrow and too short. It also contradicts the strategy formulated by the Commission itself in its communication on a strategy for the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission communication expressly states that balanced solutions are needed if the interests of consumers and the economy diverge and that electronic commerce in the European Union must be given a realistic chance to develop. However, a balanced solution can only be found in the force field between consumer protection and e-commerce business if a wide discussion is held, beyond the limited question of the right place of jurisdiction and the applicable law.</p>
      <p sl="de">The purpose of efficient consumer protection is surely to ensure that consumers can enforce their rights quickly, cheaply and without red tape. Does this in fact apply if the consumer can sue in his place of residence on the basis of the law of his land? In principle, a judgement in his country of residence gives the consumer stones, not bread, because he then has to enforce or execute the judgement in another Member State. That is generally a lengthy, arduous and cost-intensive process. If we are to have efficient consumer protection, alternatives to costly and slow court proceedings, irrespective of which court or under which law, must be evaluated.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view the magic words are settlement of disputes out of court, if necessary in connection with further harmonisation. The Directorate-General has already dealt in detail with the subject of out-of-court settlement of disputes in connection with cross-border financial services and it held a hearing on the subject in October last year. I propose that we evaluate in detail the knowledge and ideas in both the Commission’s working paper on which the hearing was based and the communication on the results of the hearing expected in the middle of this year for the purposes of electronic commerce.</p>
      <p sl="de">The approach in the e-commerce directive is, in my view, the preferable political approach and should not therefore be contradicted by the regulation in the Brussels/Lugano Convention or in Rome II. I therefore propose that we proceed either by postponing any amendment to the Brussels/Lugano Convention until all the outstanding legal issues in this area have been regulated or that we amend the Brussels/Lugano Convention but maintain the status quo of the balance of interests between suppliers and consumers.</p>

    <intervention id="4-205" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Bolkestein" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, indeed, I should like to touch upon some of the interesting points raised by your MEPs. I should like to start with an expression used by Mr Harbour and I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Harbour for the keen interest he has shown during the hearings of 4 and 5 November. The Commission always highly appreciates it if Members of this Parliament attend a hearing or other activities and I should like to take the opportunity to underline this, Mr President. Well now, Mr Harbour talked about “balance” and this is, of course, what the Commission pursues. You will understand, Mr President, that I am not only speaking on my own behalf and that of my own Directorate-General, but also on behalf of the entire Commission. The Commission comprises, among others, Mr Byrne, who has the interests of consumers at heart and, in my response in this debate, Mr President, I inevitably refer to Mr Byrne’s positions so that we, as Mrs Wallis put it, display a joined-up administration.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Well now, we are pursuing that balance, and this is a balance between the interests of the manufacturer on the one hand and the interests of the consumer on the other. So much is clear and the arguments are naturally evident too. We are hoping to achieve this balance. In my opinion, we managed to strike this balance in the directive on e-commerce. The principle of this directive is that the country of origin plays a decisive role when legal proceedings are instituted in connection with e-commerce. There is a derogation with regard to public order, to put it in general terms, but this derogation is strictly defined. It has to pertain to certain goals and not others. It must be a derogation which is necessary. The country where the infringement occurs, the infringement of public order, must be called to account. It must be given the opportunity to take measures, and the Commission must be informed. The Commission must be given the opportunity to take action against the country which has allowed the infringement to happen. In other words, the directive on e-commerce is based on the country of origin with a derogation which is, however, strictly defined. Mr President, may I also take this opportunity to urge this Parliament to approve the directive appropriately, that is to say swiftly, so that, on expiry of the Internal Market Council in May, it can find its way into European legislation. Everyone is waiting for a European directive on e-commerce, and I hope that we can achieve this in May.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to broach a different subject which has also been mentioned by a number of MEPs, not least by Mrs Palacio, but also by Mrs Oomen, for example, and this is the Brussels Convention. I take on board the criticism levelled by Mrs Palacio on the way in which the Commission’s proposal came about. We will draw lessons from that, but I would still urge Parliament, and the Committee on Legal Affairs in particular, to form an opinion on this difficult point of Article 15. If I am not mistaken, Mr President, Article 15 of the Commission’s proposal on this Brussels Convention deviates on one key point from the original convention in favour of consumer protection. Indeed, in the original convention dating back to 1968, the opportunity of consumers to invoke their own rights was subject to two requirements. Of those two requirements, one has been eliminated from the Commission’s proposal. Well now, this is a matter of high importance and which has given cause for concern among the various organisations which are involved in this. It is an issue which is preoccupying the Commission. I myself will be holding a small meeting next Wednesday, involving four other Commissioners, including Commissioner Byrne, Commissioner Vitorino and Commissioner Liikanen, to gather our thoughts on Article 15. At the same time, however, if you will allow me, Mr President, and if Mrs Palacio permits me, I would like to call on the Committee on Legal Affairs to pay due attention to Article 15, thus allowing the Commission to find out at an early stage what Mrs Palacio’s committee thinks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mrs Wallis was right to use the term joined-up administration. Well now, in consultation with Parliament, let us think of a more detailed description of Article 15, as defined in the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, a number of Members of this Parliament, Mrs Wallis, Mrs Oomen and, of course, Mrs Palacio, have referred to small claim procedures, on the one hand, and alternative dispute settlements on the other.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Parliament will understand that these are matters which do not directly fall under my remit but concern my colleague, Mr Vitorino more. This does not detract from the fact that they are, of course, closely related to this subject as a whole and that these accelerated and simplified methods of bringing legal disputes to an end are, naturally, very closely related to the functioning of the internal market. That is why I feel such a connection with this dossier. But honesty requires me to say that it is Antonio Vitorino who is primarily responsible for these matters.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Well now, I have just mentioned that we, four or five Commissioners, will be meeting next Wednesday. I can tell you now that I will be emphasising and drawing attention to the need to arrive at these two accelerated, simplified methods of ending minor legal disputes concerning e-commerce.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Once again, and I would like to finish on this remark: we are trying to seek a balance; we are trying to find a balance. We do not want, on the one hand, what Mr MacCormick suggested. We do not want any ‘long-distance rip-offs’. That is something we do not want. I would thank Mr MacCormick for this colourful phrase. On the other hand, we do not want what Mrs Wallis suggested either, a situation in which excessive protection leads to violations of the internal market. That is something we do not want. We do not want the one, but neither do we want the other. We will have to find the right way, between Scylla and Charybdis, to benefit the internal market i.e. all consumers in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">deputising for the rapporteur. – Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs McNally who was unable, due to unavoidable commitments, to stay and present the report herself.</p>
      <p sl="de">Women and science – Mobilising women to enrich European research. The communication proposes two objectives: the first is to stimulate discussion between the Member States and promote best practice in the encouragement of women in the fields of science and technology. The second is to increase the number of women involved in research supported by the Union, thereby meeting the Union’s Treaty commitments to equal opportunities and enriching research, i.e. to implement gender mainstreaming.</p>
      <p sl="de">Expenditure on research and technology is the third most important section of the European Union budget, after agriculture and the Structural Funds. We welcome the Commission’s communication and its objectives and invite the Member States to pursue the objective of gender equality and to cooperate with the Commission. We invite the Commission to produce comparable and improved data on the subject of Women and Science, to propose guidelines and further action and to deliver a special report to us here in Parliament within two years. The Commission will henceforth be working for more comparable data on women scientists and will arrange meetings between relevant parties and organise two major conferences which will bring together national civil servants, women scientists and all interested parties.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur expressly welcomes the measures already taken under the fifth framework research programme to increase the involvement of women and to insist that 40% of those participating in both the Marie Curie scholarships and all advisory committees are women and to incorporate the measures already proposed for the sixth framework programme. Women have traditionally been under-represented in scientific research and the women’s movement has had to fight hard to achieve the present position. At the beginning of the century, the first female Europeans attended university in Finland. However, university strongholds are still dominated by men and yet today nearly half the students are women. In my home country of Germany, for example, women entrants outnumbered men for the first time in 1995. The average ratio in Europe is 103 women to 100 men. Germany is bringing up the rear in the EU with 77 women to 100 men. In all events, more women than men graduate, at a ratio of 110:100. In Germany and Ireland this figure is lower. Two-thirds of female students now choose languages and humanities; more impetus is needed in the natural sciences. An understanding of natural sciences and technology must be fostered in the home and promoted generally through education, in school, in the kindergarten, everywhere and new paths must be opened. Coeducation is not always the only way forward; single-sex education can also provide an impetus, especially in the natural sciences and technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the new potential to qualify which women now have has still not been implemented in practice; the situation regarding staffing at technical colleges is still disastrous and the number of ordinary chairs in the Union is 5%, hardly any higher than at the beginning of the century in the 1920s.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, equal opportunities for women in science must also bring about more input from women as regards content. Women and gender research must be seen as basic research which is of enormous importance to the European Union. The Member States must develop new instruments to increase the unused potential of all women in research and teaching and promote exchanges of experience. Networks of women scientists must be supported and innovative projects promoted and disseminated. For example, Spain and Italy are demonstrating a higher proportion of women in the natural sciences. This must be investigated more closely.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are also examples in Germany: Expo 2000 in Hanover in the summer will stage a 100-day international women’s university for technology and culture. One thousand budding female scientists and 100 female professors are working there on an interdisciplinary, research-orientated programme in seven project areas: intelligence, information, the body, water, the city, work and migration. These valuable experiences will be carefully combined and evaluated so that a decision can be taken as to whether the university can be continued as a virtual campus with modern information technologies. As a founder member of the women’s university, I am convinced that this think tank will show us how to resolve many of our problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the interests of European research and its position with reference to globalisation, the EU must not miss a single opportunity. Another chance will be the UN Peking +5 conference due to take place in the middle of the year in New York. This will take stock of successes and failures in achieving the objectives. The people with political responsibility in the European Union and in all the Member States must take consistent action to ensure that we make structural changes to framework conditions in conjunction with the governors of technical colleges, the boards of research institutes and the economy and introduce a process of change which implements the requirement to safeguard equal opportunities prescribed in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our future lies in the 21st Century, as the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, has quite rightly demonstrated. We are not talking about cosmetic changes here; we need to make courageous incisions. Once again our warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McNally.</p>

    <intervention id="4-212" speaker_id="4323" name="Avilés Perea" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, equality of opportunity between men and women has been enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and is now one of the objectives which the European Union will have to take into account in all Community policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">The presence of women in the scientific field has increased considerably in recent years, but is still insufficient. The presence of women in universities, in all fields, has increased, but in the subjects which we would essentially call ‘scientific’ – such as mathematics, information technology, engineering and architecture – they are still under-represented. This is aggravated by the fact that, after finishing their studies with good results, in most cases they do not pursue a scientific career fundamentally because of the difficulties this gives rise to. On the one hand, this is because of the organisation of the development of the scientific profession and also because of the difficulty of reconciling professional life with family life.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, it seems to us to be especially important that the Commission has the will to defend the participation of women in the scientific field, in specific programmes, although what we consider to be really important is their participation in the context of the fifth framework programme for technological research and development for 1998-2002. Measures for the integration of women should be adopted in the specific programmes which I mentioned earlier.</p>
      <p sl="es">Through their contribution to research, women can offer all their own qualities which will doubtless enrich the scientific world. Balanced participation should be promoted, with the aim of equal participation, without forgetting that full professional qualifications are essential.</p>
      <p sl="es">The promotion of women in this field must start with the more specifically scientific universities and in the subsequent continuation of professional careers.</p>
      <p sl="es">The employment of young female researchers should be promoted by means of the Marie Curie grants, which should be granted in sufficient numbers.</p>
      <p sl="es">Women must participate at all levels of consultation and decision making, and not only in scientific investigation, since the objective is enrichment and complementarity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The participation of women in science should be promoted from school age, and particularly in information technology, since this is enormously important in terms of accessing other scientific fields, not only in the European Union, but also in the associated countries and in the under-developed areas where Union programmes are being carried out.</p>
      <p sl="es">From school age, women should be helped to participate in the scientific world and in new technologies. A greater presence of women in the scientific world should reflect the importance of the participation of women in all areas of the social sphere. A greater presence of women in the fifth and sixth framework programmes will be an example of the equality between men and women, easing their incorporation into a sector in which they have been traditionally under-represented.</p>
      <p sl="es">It will be necessary to perfect the reconciliation between professional and family lives, since this is essential to a greater presence of women in positions of responsibility. In Parliament, and particularly in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities – we will continue to work towards these fundamental objectives in order to achieve a better balance in society.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the European Commission on the initiative which it has taken to mobilise women, increase the participation of women in science and enrich European research.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is a fact that the degree to which women are represented in the field of scientific research and technology is extremely low and in complete disproportion to the progress which they have made in other fields, thanks to European policy, especially education, where we really can speak of a triumph by women now that they outnumber men at nearly all the European universities. Mrs Gröner has already given us a great deal of interesting information on this.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, the position of women generally in career posts in scientific research depends to a great extent on the choices which they make while they are in the educational system and on their position in the family. The various directions which the two sexes follow in their studies affect their future development, which is why we need to intervene early, during careers advice at school and explain to young women the consequences which their choices will have on their career.</p>
      <p sl="el">On the other hand, the preservation of traditional roles and the division of labour by sex have a negative effect on women’s career prospects, which is why, of course, we still need measures to reconcile professional and family life. However, I would like to say that this should apply in particular to men. Men need to combine their career with their family and personal life. Women make up fifty per cent of human resources, half the source of talent, skills and creativity in the world. Maintaining the present imbalance in the crucial field of research is tantamount to a loss of precious resources and impacts directly on the development and the future of the EU. None of the present-day challenges can be met without the input, ideas, imagination and skills of women.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, over and above the question of equality of the sexes, there is the development dimension of the issue, i.e. the need to support the competitiveness and the innovation of the Union. The fifth framework programme aims to incorporate political equality of the sexes. We support the initiatives to mobilise the numerous scientific networks run by women and safeguard a balance between the sexes in science and we support the institutions which are shaping policies, selecting and evaluating plans and deciding how resources should be allocated.</p>
      <p sl="el">We call on the European Commission and the Member States to consider if women are adequately represented in the common agricultural policy, in the Structural Funds, in the fifth framework programme, in the numerous scientific and technical committees and in key positions.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to close, Mr President, by asking the European Commission to use the pre-accession aid programmes to candidate Member States and Turkey in order to target the scientific skills of women and give them a better chance to contribute to scientific and technical research and development.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner Busquin, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has read the report by Mrs McNally on women and science with great interest and is, of course, dissatisfied with the imbalance which exists between the position of women and men in science.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We do find it important, though, that this situation should be highlighted and proposals formulated to improve the position of women. Commissioner Busquin has since also published a report of a study commissioned by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Twelve top female scientists from different Member States have collated hard evidence which illustrates the imbalance within the world of science. Moreover, they have formulated very concrete proposals to improve the current situation of women. The study clearly shows that the cause of the imbalance must be tackled within the scientific world itself and not amongst the women, who are said to have different interests and ambitions and make other choices. These appear to be prejudices.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are pressure points at universities and research institutes and within industry. Within each of these professional circles, there is again an imbalance in the distribution of jobs. For example, the percentage of female professors varies in the Member States from 4% to a maximum of 18% of the total number of professors. Furthermore, it appears that the percentage of female professors within one and the same institution is remarkably lower than the percentage of female assistants.</p>
      <p sl="nl">From an analysis of job-application data, it appears that women who clearly aspire to a scientific career are selected in much smaller quantities than their male colleagues. Having children does not even seem to be a stumbling block, quite the opposite in fact; women with families are said to publish more than single women.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is remarkable to observe that a higher percentage of women have scientific jobs in Southern European countries than in Northern European countries. An explanation for this is that the latter group of countries boasts flexible options for career breaks, with the consequence that re-entry into a scientific career is not so evident.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One needs to exercise extra vigilance, therefore, when it comes to women and family-friendly measures and take the necessary precautions so as to ensure that women actually retain the same opportunities as men.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We hope that this study, in conjunction with Mrs McNally’s report, will be an incentive to take further initiatives to meet the need for statistics. We rely on the European Commission to take steps to create the circumstances in which the proposals that have been made can be translated into practice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, let me first of all say that I do find it rather a shame that the debate on "Peking + 5" was already put off until the end of the parliamentary part-session a month ago, just as the debate on ‘Women and Science’ has been this time. Whenever the subject of women comes up, it would seem that we always put the discussion off until after all the other debates, which I think is a pity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, reading Mrs McNally’s report we know immediately that we are dealing with a vital issue. ‘Women and Science’ is a title that could be misleading, if it were to be seen as part of a never-ending list of ‘Women and …’ whatever subject it may be. Such a list is necessary, but occasionally it is inadequate in terms of highlighting the importance of a problem. Well, in this instance we are dealing with a vital matter that for centuries has given rise to controversy about the equality of the sexes. Can women have similar reasoning powers to men? Are women capable of scientific activity? There is no longer anyone who doubts that, and the reply now and forever must be that they can and they are. But that is where the problems start. If the situation of women in the scientific field is worrying, it is because of a number of problems that are difficult to resolve. Science, as a symbolic activity, remains a male preserve, just like political responsibility. The same obstacles are found whether it is a matter of sharing political power or academic power. In both cases, male power is at stake. So let us propose the same remedies, such as the introduction of parity in politics which has been attempted by some countries in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Girls are very successful at school and there is nothing to justify the fact that there are so few women in the world of research. The obstacles to a scientific career are external to the research itself. In other words, it is not enough to gain access to the scientific arena, this arena needs to make room for women, and not always treat them as guests, as it was put so well at the symposium in April 1998 organised by the Commission. The direction you take at school and university remains an enigma as far as the equality of the sexes is concerned. The exact sciences are often organised in such a way as to discourage girls. Coeducational training, and also the potential sexism of teachers, parents and institutions, are problems that are far from being solved. As for social sciences, they will only have a purpose if they incorporate the need to consider the ‘male-female’ dimension in all social and human problems. It is clearly necessary to have a broad view of science and to know that you cannot think about society without introducing the ‘male-female’ dimension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today we are still far short of the target. I believe that Mrs McNally’s report, and I pay tribute to its completeness as well as its complexity, is important, as it emphasises remedies, if not solutions, to the problem of the difficult practice of science, that is to say, of data and figures of course, the presence of women in the different branches, scholarships and diplomas, the introduction of restrictive measures to increase the presence of women in research, the promotion of studies on mechanisms of sexual discrimination and the setting up in the Directorates-General of the Commission of working parties and monitoring bodies. I am delighted that this report has also not omitted the problem of women’s power in science, …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, equal opportunities do indeed have a high status in the Treaties, for example in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam; however, they have no such status in professional life. In the field of science and technology, our subject today, they are only present to a very modest degree. Women tend to be employed in less secure jobs and earn less than men. Not even 10% are entrusted with research work or managerial positions. The under-representation of women completely contradicts their talents and skills, their creativity and flexibility at a high level.</p>
      <p sl="de">European programmes are already helping significantly to improve the quality of research results and extend cooperation between Member States. Positive change can be based on statistics with gender-specific data and knowledge of various models for promoting women. Other Community programmes, such as parts of SOCRATES and LEONARDO for education and training should be intertwined with measures at national level such as curricula with more lessons in mathematics and the natural sciences. Young women will then gain access to information technology and many will become recognised scientists. In other words, they will forge careers other than in the classical women’s fields of education, medicine or the social professions.</p>
      <p sl="de">What do we need? More part-time jobs, more crèches in companies and, more importantly, more women in advisory, selection and decision-making committees for projects and positions. Nonetheless, I am not totally in favour of the need for quotas. Laying down strict requirements for at lest 40% of women in research programmes and institutes undermines the self-confidence of those women who have made or will make their way without any such help. However, given the crass under-representation of women in science I accept it unreservedly as a flexible guideline or point of reference.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I must firstly congratulate the Commission on the expediency and quality of its communication on women and science which highlights the current imbalance and the need to change this situation. I also want to congratulate my colleague, Mrs McNally, on her excellent report and the proposals which it contains.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To my mind, this report could not have come at a better time. It is a recognised fact that the participation of women in working life is essential for the future of Europe. The rate of employment in Europe is lower than that in the United States of America and Japan and the low rate of female activity in the majority of the Member States is therefore not surprising.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although the role of women is essential in increasing European production, the importance of their contribution to the financing of social security and, therefore, the maintenance of a social model, must also be mentioned. Yet it is not enough just to analyse the amount of work carried out by women in the European Union for the quality of this work is also fundamental. It is also essential for society to recognise that women with professional qualifications are capable of participating in the sectors which are the most demanding in terms of professional training and in which the European Union has major shortages.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union has between 700 000 and 800 000 vacant jobs due to a lack of people with the training needed to develop the information society and use new technologies. Women scientists in Europe must therefore be provided with every support and every opening so that in this sector they can play the role which they not only deserve but which is also vital to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report is opportune because the Portuguese presidency is going to hold an extraordinary summit in Lisbon next March on employment, economic reforms and cohesion for a Europe of innovation and knowledge. The aim of this summit is to establish the bases of a development model which can put Europe in the vanguard of economic competitiveness at world level. This will not be possible without extensive participation by European women scientists. Positive measures must therefore be taken in this respect, instead of simply allowing societal developments and mainstreaming policies to have an effect. I have high hopes that the Portuguese presidency will give due attention to the participation of women in this programme, not only because the Portuguese Ministry for Equality is committed to this but also – and this is no coincidence – because the coordination of the programme to be presented at the Lisbon Summit was entrusted by the Portuguese Prime Minister to a woman scientist.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I hope that the good intentions of the Commission and Council will be translated into specific proposals aimed at improving the participation of European women, in quantitative and qualitative terms, in the areas of science and new technologies.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we are debating today the problem of access for women to science and research. Neither the Commission text nor the report achieve that objective. First of all, they fail to link this issue to the more general women’s issue. They do not present quantitative data which give a clear picture of the situation over and beyond a few statistics on the ratio between the sexes at university. However, there is a huge gap between university and a career in research. The biggest problem in the texts is that they do not go into the problem in depth or indicate the causes of it. In fact, the non-specific reference to the existence of complex structural barriers or to the fact that the prevailing culture of research is generally male cannot be considered as a serious interpretation of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="el">The inability to make full use of productive resources, especially human resources, and the lack of equal opportunity are basic features of the capitalist system. This has significant repercussions, especially on the more sensitive social strata, such as young people and women. It is not by chance that the situation and social position of women was far better in the former Socialist states than it is in the West. The society in which we live has created a framework which is hostile towards women. For example, the policy of constantly reducing social benefits and dismantling national insurance systems has resulted in increased pressure on women to take on their traditional role. This applies all the more so to women scientists.</p>
      <p sl="el">For certain, the problem will not be solved by so-called flexibility or by part-time employment, since research calls for dedication and consistent work. No one will have any objection to numerous proposals in the resolution, such as more detailed statistics, a database of female experts etc. However, these measures will not solve the problem. More importantly, the problem will not be solved with quotas. A different policy is needed, a policy which respects people in general and women in particular, the driving force behind which is not profit for a few and the objective of which is not exploitation of the masses. Of course, we do not expect the European Union to pursue such a policy, but we do expect the people of the European Union to impose it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I am very pleased to be taking the floor in order to illustrate my support for this programme, put forward by Mrs McNally, on including women in science as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">For the first time, I am speaking as representative of the Pensioners’ Party. While I am national secretary of the Pensioners’ Party in Italy, its leader, Giuseppina Cardazzi, is a woman, and we are therefore fully aware of the importance of women. It is more important to achieve equality between men and women in science more than in any other field. We have only had male scientists so far: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, von Braun, Einstein, to name but a few.</p>
      <p sl="it">Just imagine, Commissioner Busquin, what would have happened if women had had the same opportunities as men over the last 2000 years! Just imagine, President Provan, if women had already been, over the last 2000 years, in the position where the Commission now wants them by means of this proposal. I am absolutely certain that, if this had been the case, we would have progressed much further than is actually the case.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we know, women live much longer than men. We are still wondering what on earth they have that men do not, but I am sure that this certain something, that we still have not pinpointed, will also become apparent through scientific research. The fact that this measure allows women to express their scientific ability – hidden until today – is much more important than the fact that it offers them job opportunities. This is why I take particular pleasure in declaring my support for this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, experience has taught us that, unless you stand up and draw attention to yourself, you are likely to be forgotten, and that is what we are talking about this evening. I should like to thank my colleague for his kind, encouraging words. We all know, however, both from experience and from the discussion here this evening, that it is not down to good intentions nor women alone. There are complex structural barriers, one might even say stereotypical barriers, which have prevented women from taking a more active role in science and research. As women, we are under-represented here and none of the speakers here this evening has claimed otherwise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Science and research: anyone who wants to work here, who wants opportunities here must also be permanently available. And that is often very, very difficult for women. We need to be flexible. Women are tied to the family, children, perhaps even their husband’s place of work. We need to offer flexibility, to accommodate women and offer them the possibility for permanent further development in this fast changing area.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fifth framework programme makes a special effort to incorporate equal opportunities. Particular account must be taken of the EU’s obligation to safeguard equal opportunities in the field of science. Instruments and methods to encourage women to enter the classical natural sciences must be promoted from an early age. Women are proving their academic abilities on scientific courses and yet women scientists are still being paid less than their male counterparts. They rarely get to the top, they rarely have positions of responsibility. Scientific research by women is often held in lower esteem by committees of experts than research by their male counterparts.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have reached agreement in the House here this evening. We look forward to receiving the Commission’s report and hope that this will enable us to achieve progress for more women in science.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the principle of equality runs through all of the Union’s policies as a main theme and scientific activity must not be an exception. Therefore, we must welcome Mrs McNally’s report, as well as the corresponding Commission communication, and we hope that it will receive the full support of this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to highlight three points which seem to me to be important. The first relates to the fact that, as the report and communication point out, it is precisely in the countries of the South – Italy, Portugal and Spain – where the presence of women in the scientific field is most balanced, which shows us that, in science, it is important, as it is in life in general, not to trust in clichés.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second point refers to quotas. It is impossible to avoid quantitative elements in evaluating a policy, but quotas must be understood in a global way and in terms of trends, that is to say, as an objective in the medium or long term, as something to apply in general terms, but not as a rigid number to be imposed automatically in each consultative group, in each assessment and review group.</p>
      <p sl="es">Incentives, stimulus, promotion, the removal of obstacles and the elimination of prejudice must be pursued relentlessly. However, what we can never do is put the cart before the horse. It is the old problem of means and ends. The means must be adequate and proportionate and, above all, they must not endanger the most important thing, which is the quality, rigour and achievement of scientific activity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, the third point is that scientific method has no sex. Madame Curie thought in the same way as Lord Rutherford and Madame Kowaleska thought in the same way as Elie Cartán. We must do everything possible to balance the presence of women in the scientific field, but let us not seek short cuts which will cause us to lose our way.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in presenting this communication, the Commission wished to take a strong political initiative on the subject of the place of women in research. I am pleased to note that this initiative has been very warmly welcomed by Parliament, which I should like to thank for the important role that it plays in the “women and science” debate. The motion for a resolution that we are discussing today largely supports the guidelines drawn up by the Commission. This encouragement is very significant.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the subject of women and science comes within the broader context of research policy in the Union. As I already said to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the aim is to develop a political strategy to create a European research area. The Commission has just adopted a communication to this effect on 18 January. The creation of such an area will make it easier to harness the potential represented by women scientists and to take up the common challenge of the under-representation of women in research.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is aware of the debate on the quota principle in the matter of women’s participation in general. This debate is also, of course, evolving with regard to the participation of women in scientific research. The Commission has not chosen the mandatory quota approach, as it prefers that of quantitative participation objectives, linked to follow-up and evaluation. The Commission considers that this approach will make it possible to progress the participation of women, while respecting the principle of scientific excellence. Mrs McNally’s report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Women’s Rights, supports the guidelines of the Commission, whose aim is to achieve at least 40% female participation in certain aspects of the implementation of the fifth framework programme. This support is important. Already, the presence of women is 26% in the advisory groups and 24% in the monitoring and evaluation panels, which represents considerable progress compared to the fourth framework programme. There is still work to be done, however, but I feel we are going in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs McNally also recommends that the impact studies on gender in the specific programmes of the fifth framework programme be taken into account for the sixth framework programme. The Commission has already published the call for tenders in respect of these studies. The Commission will evaluate the tenders received. The results of these studies will make it possible to draw up the guidelines for the sixth framework programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the promotion of equal opportunities goes beyond the simple framework of the Community research programmes and I understand Parliament’s concern to see this matter taken into account in the other policies of the Union. The Commission is already taking action in this regard and will continue to do so, for example, in the context of guidelines for employment, the fourth pillar and in the regulations on the Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its reform project outlined in a White Paper, the Commission sets the objective of a broad balance in the representation of the sexes in all fields and at all hierarchical levels. Mrs McNally suggests an examination of the reasons for the gap between the number of women with degrees in science and the number ultimately exercising a profession in these fields. A number of speakers have referred to this. The reasons for this gap are complex and the report published recently by the ETAM experts deals with this question. It is important to continue the analysis in more detail in order to better identify the obstacles and ways to overcome them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, the implementation of the action plan presented in the communication is also being actively pursued and the report by the ETAM experts, which Mrs Sorensen reported on so aptly, which was presented on 23 November, in the presence of Members of Parliament, including Mrs McNally, reviews the under-representation of women in research. This report, which was written by independent experts, is a very useful tool for encouraging discussion and coming up with specific measures.</p>
