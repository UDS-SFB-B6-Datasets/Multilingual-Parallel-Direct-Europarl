      <p sl="unknown">I shall begin with some very sad information regarding the floods in Europe. Yet again this year, Europe has been hit by a flood disaster. Recently, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and northern Italy have suffered – at the moment there is flooding in central Italy – as well as the south-west of England and several other countries. Perhaps, when you take the opportunity to speak, because I will open the floor in a moment, you will give other examples, too, of serious floods which have afflicted Europe.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">There have been fatalities, as well as material losses valued at many millions. Eight years ago, the European Union Solidarity Fund was established to help countries which have been hit by natural disasters. The money set aside in this fund has so far been used in 33 serious natural disasters. We share, today, the pain of the victims’ families and of those from whom the water has taken everything they possessed. We know these are terrible, exceptional events in the life of every person affected.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent weeks, severe floods have struck several European countries, bringing the populations of the affected regions to their knees.</p>
      <p sl="it">Last week, four Belgian citizens lost their lives in the provinces of Waals-Brabant, Oost-Vlanderen and Henegouwen, on the border between the capital and the northern part of the country. As far as the authorities are concerned, it was the worst flood of the past 50 years. In two days, as much rain fell as normally falls in one month. It was so bad that the army had to intervene to evacuate the hardest hit areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">Similar situations arose in the western part of France, where many roads were impassable to traffic and caused gridlock to the transport system. Seed could not be sown in autumn due to the continual rain that prevented access to the land.</p>
      <p sl="it">Twenty days ago, my own country, Italy, was also hard hit in the regions of Veneto, where two deaths occurred, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Liguria and Calabria, with one fatality in each, and the province of Salerno in Campania and Tuscany, where three people died, with dozens of injured people having to be extricated from the mud and rubble and one person who is still missing in Rovigo.</p>
      <p sl="it">The damage amounts to more than EUR 1 billion for the most immediate work alone, to which must be added the funds necessary for structural works. More than 4 500 homeless, 280 municipalities and more than 500 000 people affected, farming areas devastated and 150 000 dead livestock.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to highlight two aspects. The first is the exceptional mobilisation of the aid machinery and the world of solidarity that sent thousands of volunteers to support the people struck by the first stage of the emergency. They deserve the thanks and appreciation of our institution.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second aspect is linked to the long-term effects that this catastrophe will trigger. The fabric of the European manufacturing industry is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises that have lost everything: machinery, vehicles and materials. The same applies to the thousands of farms that have seen their crops destroyed but also the tractors, machinery and seeds rendered useless by the mud, with stables and stock farms flooded and thousands of cattle and poultry drowned.</p>
      <p sl="it">These farms, which were already struggling with the economic crisis, are now destined for bankruptcy. Over time, the floods will lead to the destruction of the productive system, with unemployment and depletion of the affected lands. Europe must therefore play its part as a matter of urgency by assuring the governments of those countries affected of its willingness to mobilise the Solidarity Fund.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even if it means overriding the strict criteria for fund activation and even without the approval of the 2011 budget, we must respond immediately to our fellow citizens who are still experiencing, even now, the effects of such a great crisis, and who are entitled to feel that Parliament is behind them and the European Union is providing substantial support.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to show our solidarity with all of the regions hit by natural disasters, and give our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the storms. 2010 began with the world in shock at the scale of the tragedy caused by the disaster that struck the autonomous region of Madeira, in Portugal. Shortly afterwards, storm Xynthia buffeted France. Extreme meteorological phenomena also affected Spain, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, causing substantial damage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In Central Europe, summer floods are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating. Thousands of people have had to flee their homes in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Italy and the United Kingdom, and numerous factories have had to cease operation. Every year, hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest in southern Europe are consumed by fires. It is thought that climate change is exacerbating the situation and that natural disasters which cause terrible damage in terms of loss of lives, environmental damage and reduced economic activity are on the rise. It is vital to prevent, research and properly manage the risk.</p>
      <p sl="pt">According to the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, better urban planning in coastal zones and the preservation of ecosystems can reduce the impact of natural disasters. On the other hand, civil protection mechanisms should be strengthened, the EU’s response instruments simplified and the rules for implementing regulations made more flexible. Mr President, you have spoken about the Solidarity Fund. It is incomprehensible that the Council has maintained the block on the new regulation on the Solidarity Fund, which was approved by Parliament. I would also point out that Parliament recently approved the proposal for the creation of a European Drought Observatory as a centre for knowledge, mitigation and monitoring of the effects of drought. Greater investment in prevention and more care in the preparation and training of personnel can also make all the difference.</p>

    <intervention id="2-009" speaker_id="4243" name="Dirk Sterckx" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, of course, our first sympathies lie with the victims. In my country, four people have drowned and I hear that in other countries, too, hundreds and thousands of people have suffered enormous financial and emotional losses to their businesses and homes. Our first thoughts go out to them, of course. In recent weeks, months, even years, a large number of Member States have encountered problems with water, that is, with flooding. I have a question for the Commission. Do you think that, in assessing these events, it would be useful to bring together experts from various Member States, from various regions, and give them the opportunity to tell us what their opinions are about what has happened, so that we can get a better insight into the causes? It is a very complicated matter, but, in my view, if we can get to the bottom of the causes, we will also be able to discuss remedies with those experts. In my view, a risk analysis of each river basin, such as those we have carried out for the environment in the Water Directive, would be appropriate. We also need to consult them about preventative measures. How can we prevent such a disaster happening again? Because, we are still expecting some heavy rain and it will be concentrated in particular areas; that has, after all, been the cause of the flooding. Finally, if we then experience a new emergency, we will need to ensure that we are able to take better coordinated measures to improve water disposal. I would like to ask the Commission to bring experts together so that we can properly assess the recent disasters.</p>

    <intervention id="2-010" speaker_id="96639" name="Isabelle Durant" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I, too, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, should like to offer my condolences to all the families and all the people who have been affected by these tragic floods, to all those who have lost loved ones, and to all those who have sustained material losses. However, I should also like to mention and thank all the fire-fighters, rescue workers and volunteers who have been very active over the last few weeks in all the affected regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The victims will have to be assisted and compensated not only in the very short term, but also in the months to come. We will also have to come up with a consistent and innovative policy that tackles the root causes of the problem, and I propose three types of measure to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, we must carry out renovation and construction projects to make the soil less impermeable, because every time an industrial site, shopping centre or housing estate is built, it must be designed in such a way as to prevent the soil from becoming slightly more impermeable. This provision does not just apply to flood zones.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we must review our agricultural practices. Intensive agricultural policies have made the land more vulnerable to sudden changes in the weather. We should therefore strengthen all agri-environmental measures along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, there is the matter of alerting and coordinating towns so that they can prepare for and deal with such incidents when they occur. We feel that communication and mobilisation have not been fast enough at times, and thought will no doubt have to be given to more active procedures for coordinating the dissemination of weather warnings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore propose that the European Union should review all of its policies – prevention policies and active policies in all other areas – and should develop ones that can be of help in this matter, otherwise, when the next rather extreme weather events occur in a few months’ time, we will find ourselves back here offering our condolences to the victims – to people, families and businesses. I believe we should avoid that, and we can do so in all of our policies.</p>

    <intervention id="2-011" speaker_id="96956" name="Julie Girling" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, my group also extends its sincere condolences to those affected. I have very personal experience of this; indeed, it was the flooding in my own region which first brought me into contact with the European Parliament and indeed inspired me to become a Member eventually, so the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in that event was certainly a big event for me. Only this week, we have had further flooding in Cornwall, which is in my region.</p>
      <p sl="en">My point has already been made by Mr Sterckx, but I think it bears repetition. I think that early warnings are important, but we all know how quickly the weather moves and how quickly the weather changes. I wonder if it is really a good use of money to put a lot into early warnings on weather, which are already really there. It is about what you do when you get the warnings. As Mr Sterckx has said, Europe could certainly add a great deal of value by having a situation in which we could learn from each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know in the case of Gloucestershire, where I came from, we were greatly helped after the floods by connections most particularly with Austrian regions, where they had major experience of flooding in highly elevated areas. We did not have that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it would be a very good idea for the Commission to focus on setting up some regional connections so that we can learn from each other about how we cope with this, because it clearly is not going to go away.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to express my sympathy for the victims and for those affected. All the groups in Parliament are in agreement on this. We also agree that we must provide aid quickly. A lot of sensible things have already been said. It is not necessary for me to repeat them, but I do fully support them. There is one further aspect that I would like to highlight and that is the long-term damage. We must not forget that many of the consequences will have a more lasting impact on the natural environment than we may currently anticipate. Therefore, it seems important to me for the Solidarity Fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these long-term consequences of natural destruction.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one last point. We can sit here and discuss this issue, but the most important thing for us to do is to provide support, so that people can begin to organise help for themselves, because they have a better understanding of the local conditions than we do here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I would like to express my solidarity with all citizens affected by the flood. I would nevertheless like to talk about my own region, a region of 5 million inhabitants where 500 000 people were struck by the flood, with 131 municipalities involved, 7 000 inhabitants displaced, 140 km2 flooded, three hospitals and medical facilities evacuated and two deaths. Farming was hard hit, and 23% of the enterprise system of the Veneto also felt the full impact. This is just to give you an idea of the size of this catastrophe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe must do more. Europe must mobilise the Solidarity Fund and we know that if the budget is not approved, the fund cannot be mobilised. It is all very well for us to sit here talking about great strategies, development plans and mythical programmes: Europe should also invest more in the research and prevention of hydrogeological risk, promote responsible land planning and provide incentives for the use and development of early warning systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">It should invest more in hydraulic defence works, because our rivers are at risk and they continue to endanger the health of our citizens. I therefore hope wholeheartedly that Europe, for once, will come up with a response and let its voice be heard, because it is often accused of being too far removed from its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Both natural disasters and industrial disasters, as we have seen from the recent tragedy of the toxic sludge spill in Hungary, are, unfortunately, a relatively frequent occurrence in Europe. The credibility of the European Union as an organisation showing solidarity in need depends on an ability to provide effective and particularly rapid assistance to affected areas and their citizens. The most important issue here is time. The rules governing any assistance should therefore be as flexible as possible, especially in the case of disasters of a cross-border nature. The condition of achieving a defined expected level of damage, regardless of the size of the affected territory and the intensity of the damage, seems unsatisfactory. It is actually impossible to predict everything. I therefore fully support changes aimed at the effective and rapid mobilisation of resources. Being able to help our own citizens is, in my view, a significant positive element in the perception of the EU. How better to prove that Europe is here for its citizens?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission concerning the 10th anniversary of the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women and peace and security.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to welcome to the Chamber the representative of the Council and the representative of the Commission.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-018" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olivier Chastel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of taking the floor in this debate on behalf of Baroness Ashton, Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me, first of all, Mr President, to thank the European Parliament for its continued interest in the topic of women, peace and security, and to point out – although you obviously know this – that Parliament was the first institution, just one month after the adoption of resolution 1325, to call for its implementation by means of a resolution within this institution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ten years later, we can conclude that progress has been made. We now have a significantly enhanced international framework, in particular, thanks to the adoption, in 2009, of resolutions 1888 and 1889. The appointment of the first United Nations Special Representative on violence against women in armed conflicts was an important step.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, there are currently more than 20 national plans throughout the world. However, the situation persists, and the reality is that the protection of women in conflict situations and their participation in peacekeeping and reconstruction processes still fall short of the pledges made and of the needs on the ground. Violence, and particularly sexual violence, against women and girls in conflicts continues to destroy many lives and, all too often, with complete impunity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union is firmly committed to implementing resolution 1325 and subsequent resolutions. Today, we have a sound EU policy on women, peace and security, covering all aspects of the Union’s external relations, from crisis management up to and including humanitarian aid and development cooperation. I should like to mention here a few specific achievements: one of the actions entails exchanging good practices.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To this end, experts from the EU institutions and the Member States regularly participate in a task force. This process has led to an increase in the number of programmes at national level. 10 Member States now have a national action plan and two other plans are being drafted. The European Union has a series of programmes designed to meet the needs of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations, such as the funding of medical care for victims of sexual violence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In less than two years, this programme has funded projects in 67 countries, with over EUR 300 million provided in total. The European Union has started using a gender tracker to track gender mainstreaming in development cooperation programmes. It has gender advisers and gender focal points in each of its 13 common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions, as well as gender focal points in more than 80 EU delegations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are currently finalising a report in which conclusions are drawn from the integration of gender and human rights issues in common security and defence policy. The European Union is also working closely with civil society in order to promote the participation of women in the areas of peace and security.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2011, we plan to launch some specific projects to support women’s networks in crisis-affected countries, with an estimated budget of EUR 2 million. Several EU delegations have organised Open Door days to mark the 10th anniversary of resolution 1325 and to meet local women’s groups, such as those in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Iraq, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In mid-October, the European Union and the African Union organised a seminar for civil society in Addis Ababa, with a view to making recommendations for joint European Union-African Union actions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, as regards renewed and measurable commitments, we plan to develop, by the end of the year, some standard training elements on gender, human rights and children’s rights which will be used to train the personnel of CSDP missions; to develop, by 2013, local strategies to implement resolution 1325 in development cooperation in at least 60% of conflict and post-conflict countries; and, lastly, to report regularly on the implementation of the EU’s women, peace and security commitments, by using the 17 indicators that were adopted in July 2010. The first report is being finalised as we speak.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 26 October, the European Union took part in a debate at the Security Council to mark the 10th anniversary of resolution 1325. The Belgian Presidency had previously organised three ministerial, high-level and expert meetings in Brussels, New York and Geneva in order to raise awareness and make recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union has accordingly made strong calls for increased international monitoring of resolution 1325, in particular by emphasising all the indicators developed by the Secretary-General. The European Union therefore now calls for the swift, operational implementation of those indicators.</p>

    <intervention id="2-019" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, thank you very much to the Belgian President-in-Office of the Council for his words on this subject. The Commission fully supports what the representative of the Council has just said, and I would like to add three specific points.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, I would like to say that I entirely agree with what the President-in-Office of the Council said: there is clear progress, with more than 20 national action plans established worldwide, as well as the appointment of the first United Nations Special Representative for violence against women in armed conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second point I would like to make to all of you is that the Commission believes that more work needs to be done on preventing violence against women and girls in conflicts and, in particular, against sexual and gender violence, something which continues to happen and which is destroying many lives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, the European Union must set an example by applying resolution 1325 and the resolutions implementing it.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to continue to pay attention to the needs of women and children affected by armed conflicts, and also in post-conflict situations, through programmes financing, for example, the provision of medical services for the survivors of sexual and gender violence, by working alongside civil society to promote the participation of women in building peace and security and, of course, by working closely with the United Nations on drawing up the indicators that the Secretariat-General has developed.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union must also take other steps; for example, the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative, Baroness Ashton, has appointed the first female EU Special Representative for Sudan, Dame Rosalind Marsden.</p>

    <intervention id="2-020" speaker_id="23866" name="Edit Bauer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the adoption of resolution 1325 by the UN Security Council ten years ago obviously represented an historical step on the part of the international community, taken in the wake of the tragic experience of the Yugoslav Wars. Wars take their greatest toll on the innocent civilians, and in times of armed conflicts, civilians largely consist of women. Our experience has shown that armed conflicts have thus far been accompanied by the rape of women, and it is no coincidence that the Geneva Convention also acknowledges that this often amounts to genocide.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Even after the conflicts, stigmatisation and the consequences of violation continue to devastate the lives of the victims, as the scars left by physical and psychological abuse remain for life – if the victim ever recovers from them at all. It is therefore no overstatement to request that the prevention of violence against women become an integral part of public safety and defence policy, and that there be means by which acts of violence committed against civilians can be brought to an end. The efforts made by the UN in this regard can obviously not remain without appropriate response, as even today, women are being raped in their thousands in war zones, and are then cast out by their families, thus becoming double victims.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Recently, over 8 000 women were raped in eastern Congo within a span of five days, but there is also the issue of refugee camps, such as Camp Ashraf, where women are not safe to this day. It is also justified to request an increase in the participation of women in peacekeeping forces, as the presence of women under these specific circumstances is of extreme importance. We believe that it is important for women to play a more active part in peace processes. We cannot allow them to simply be passive participants or even victims of such processes. I am pleased to note that the Commission has taken serious steps in this respect.</p>

    <intervention id="2-021" speaker_id="39319" name="Maria Eleni Koppa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, it is 10 years since UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security was adopted. It is an important anniversary, more topical than ever, because women, like children, are still the biggest victims of war.</p>
      <p sl="el">The thousands of cases of rape in war zones prove that rape and sexual abuse are systematically used as a weapon of war to humiliate and demoralise the opponent. In numerous cases, soldiers, guided by their superiors, systematically commit rape which, if committed in public, inflicts an even greater injury on the opposing side. The victims of these practices, generally women, are stigmatised, rejected or even murdered by their own community in an effort to restore honour.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must all pull together in this fight. This disgrace to humanity, these war crimes, must stop. At the same time, we must increase controls everywhere, including by the blue berets, because we have a great deal of direct and indirect responsibility. Strict sanctions need to be imposed on everyone involved in such practices. Training, controls, discipline and a clear message are needed. Finally, we need to show the international community that we mean what we say.</p>
      <p sl="el">As resolution 1325 states, women can and must participate equally in the promotion of peace and security. Our common objective must be to put women in a stronger position, with the facility to take recourse to the international courts, with programmes for their economic, social and mental reintegration. Their emancipation and protection are the sine qua non in putting a stop to the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.</p>

    <intervention id="2-022" speaker_id="96728" name="Barbara Lochbihler" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, exactly 10 years ago, women’s rights as a fundamental element of human rights first became a topic for discussion by the UN Security Council following a call for gender equality in conflict and crisis situations. This was a milestone on the road to the introduction of a mandatory requirement under international law for the participation of women at decision-making levels in peace processes and security policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, made an urgent call in 2005 for national action plans to be drawn up for the implementation of resolution 1325. We have already heard that only 20 states have so far done this, including European countries such as Sweden and Great Britain, but also African countries, for example, Liberia and the Côte d’Ivoire. I believe that all the EU Member States should adopt action plans of this kind. This also applies to countries such as Germany, where I come from, which has so far refused to compile an action plan.</p>
      <p sl="de">The gender perspective has definitely become more important at an international level. A new UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence has been appointed and the UN Entity for Gender Equality has been established. However, we must be aware that all of these measures are very much in their early stages. This is about providing support for women and girls who have been the victims of sexual violence. We must intensify the resolutions and the aid programmes that are already in place. However, this is also about support for identifying and prosecuting the offenders, which must always be linked to the reform of local judicial systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Chastel’s message on behalf of Baroness Ashton concerning the provision of EUR 2 million to support this resolution is a very positive one. I would like to make it clear how important it is to involve local women’s rights NGOs, so that the money goes to where it is really needed.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, women and children are victims in wars and conflict situations. Violence, rape, torture and sexual assaults are weapons that are used against women and children in these situations. Women have now been recognised as victims, and indeed they are victims. They have been recognised, among other things, as a result of the appointment of Margot Wallström to the post of UN Special Representative.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, women are not just victims; they are important players in peace and security work for the prevention of conflicts. Their participation in the work to establish peace and democracy following wars and conflicts is essential. They play an active part in the reconstruction of the countries. Despite the fact that it is ten years since the adoption of the UN resolution, women are still only recognised as victims of violence. They are ignored in connection with the important reconstruction work for establishing peace and democracy. Despite the fact that we now know what an important part women play in this work, it is still the men who have all the influence over the decisions. It is time that we recognised the capability of women, including in connection with the peace and security work. The EU must demand that the gender perspective is taken into account when providing assistance and subsidies for reconstruction work.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security is one of the latest serious documents in which all of the nations of the world declare their respect and reverence for the fairer sex.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Every provision of the resolution has its own profound sense, and responds to problems which life often brings in relationships between men and women, when women and children frequently become the victims of force, unbridled violence and injustice in crisis situations. The advanced civilised countries subscribe to their commitments arising from UN Security Council resolution 1325 and strive, through various measures, to create the greatest possible space for applying these in national and international institutions involved in conflict resolution and the organisation of peace processes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, serious problems persist over respect for the human rights of women and children in many countries in the developing world, especially in central Africa and several parts of Asia. The actions of barbaric military regimes are based on a different scale of values than the one recognised by the civilised world, and the human dignity of civilians, women and children means nothing to bands of murderers.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, this is an area we should look at and focus greater attention on as soon as possible. It is therefore also necessary to take measures in EU policy to exert greater and more intensive pressure on those regimes which do not respect the basic human rights of their citizens and inhabitants.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that all of us could easily answer the question as to which major group of people is essentially excluded from decision making, or is only minimally involved in it, while, at the same time, having to bear the consequences of political, economic and financial decisions to a very large extent. Yes, fellow Members, I am referring to women, and not only in connection with armed conflicts, which is the topic of today’s sitting, but also in connection with the economy, because it is, after all, women who must put food on their families’ tables, and it is women who suffer through poverty, together with their children, to an especially significant degree. To me, this is the core message of this UN declaration – that women should be given considerably greater opportunities in decision making, so that they can become shapers, rather than victims, of their fates.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In what ways do armed conflicts affect women? Let us look at the example of Gaza. Even now, it is women who are nursing and tending to those injured as a result of the brutality of the State of Israel, it is women who nurse and tend to the children who have become disabled as a consequence, and it is women who suffer significantly from the effects of the bombing and destruction of infrastructure, the bombardment of roads and schools. We should keep this in mind when we take account of the torments women have to endure in armed conflicts.</p>

    <intervention id="2-027" speaker_id="96884" name="Philippe Juvin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in conflict areas, the use of violence against women is a deliberate tactic. Rape is a widespread, systematic and organised practice. It is a weapon of war. We must, of course, condemn this violence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Condemnation aside, however, we must go beyond mere declarations, otherwise they just become a mantra. We must find ways to act. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I am asking you to consider three courses of action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first course of action: I believe we should be convinced of the need for the European Union to promote local women’s organisations in all those conflict situations in which it intervenes. Respect for the basic principles of freedom and justice will increase if it can be founded on women. Wherever women are granted rights in the world, respect for human dignity and the values of equality and fraternity – which are EU values – will be promoted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second course of action: when we Europeans contribute aid to help rebuild countries, I believe we should consider making it a requirement for governing powers and local authorities on the ground – which we help – to introduce quotas to ensure the participation of women at decision-making levels. I am thinking, for example, of the Palestinian Authority, which we help, which is funded almost entirely by us. The situation in the Middle East could only benefit if we demanded that the Palestinian Authority introduce quotas allowing for women to hold positions of political responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the third course of action: wherever we intervene, by civilian, police or military means, I believe we must undertake to give women a significant and appropriate role within our own troops and operational delegations. This will only serve to make us more effective and, as many reports suggest, it will probably mean that populations are more willing to accept us.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has now been 10 years since the United Nations Security Council adopted, for the first time in its history, a resolution highlighting the specific situation of women living in combat areas and their role in resolving conflicts. However, today, 10 years on from that resolution, thousands of women are still being raped in war-torn countries, such as Congo for example. I myself have strongly criticised the impunity enjoyed for many years by the perpetrators of these atrocities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, these barbaric acts are committed even though United Nations forces are sometimes, or even often, present on the ground. I believe that we are sorely lacking in political ambition and adequate funds. In particular, I would emphasise the need to train the field-based personnel of European and international organisations and to raise awareness among the suffering populations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to make everyone understand that taking gender considerations into account will lead to improvements in all areas. We must put an end to the impunity too often enjoyed by those who commit violence against women, and we must establish a proper complaints procedure in this regard. We must also increase the financial resources available within the European institutions for work on gender and human rights issues, in particular, so as to implement mechanisms and assess the progress made by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I note that, as Mr Chastel said, efforts have indeed been made, in particular, through the exchange of best practice and participation in a task force. Moreover, 10 Member States now have a national action plan. I hope that the 17 other Member States will soon have one of their own.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I would point out that I have high hopes for the future External Action Service. I hope that women and men will participate in it equally, in particular, on the ground. We must never forget the important role women play in resolving conflicts or the need to establish communication that is based on trust between the forces of international institutions and local populations.</p>

In response to this, a peaceful demonstration took place last Saturday in the streets of Lisbon, organised by the ‘Yes to peace, no to NATO’ campaign, which includes more than 100 organisations. Tens of thousands of people, men and women, marched calling for peace and social justice, which is essential for security, and shouting and demanding the dissolution of NATO, nuclear disarmament and respect for people’s rights in the defence of peace.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I, too, would like to emphasise the historical importance of Security Council resolution 1325 for peace and for security policy. It was the first time that the UN emphasised the importance of the protection of women and their full involvement in creating peace, maintaining peace and preventing conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It must be said that great efforts have been made over the past 10 years to achieve this aim. However, abuse of women is often still a major characteristic of conflicts. What is more, there has been an alarming increase in frequent and systematic violence against women both during and after conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I will not give any concrete figures, but it is surely worth mentioning the horrific events that have taken place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Darfur, Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Bosnia. I have personally met and spoken with women who were victims of violence during the war in the former Yugoslavia. Their stories are horrific. They were raped, tortured and humiliated. Many were ostracised even after the conflict was over.</p>
      <p sl="sk">So not even the cessation of conflict will guarantee an end to violence against women. We should always bear this in mind.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Protection of women and enabling their participation in the creation of peace and security is the main aim of resolution 1325. Unfortunately, this has yet to happen in many cases. I firmly believe there is a real chance that we can change things. However, the political will of all is required if we are to create the actual conditions. In fulfilling this task, I also see the opportunity for a positive contribution from High Representative Baroness Ashton and the European External Action Service, which could greatly strengthen the role of the EU in implementing this important resolution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, women and children continue to be disproportionately hard hit by wars and their consequences. However, women’s rights must not be misused in order to give legitimacy to military interventions. The example of the Republic of Congo shows that military measures do not help to protect, secure or establish women’s rights. Unfortunately, exactly the opposite is true. The situation of women in Afghanistan today is worse than ever as a result of the war. The promise made in resolution 1325 can only really be honoured by avoiding conflict and taking only civil measures in war and conflict situations. Therefore, I believe that it is completely unacceptable to distort this resolution with the aim of increasing the number of women involved in warfare. I am calling for the EU to stop providing support on principle, including aid for equipment and training, to regimes and military forces which send child soldiers into armed conflicts, violate human rights or commit systematic acts of sexual violence.</p>

They are victims, yet not decision makers. Women should participate in the entire process of preventing and resolving conflicts. If there were more women in senior positions of policy making, including economic decision making, there would certainly be more peace and security in the world, and we would all benefit from greater development and better living conditions. That is why we also need more women involved in decision making at all levels. As has already been said here, women should participate and be players throughout this process; it should not be conducted only by men.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would strongly highlight the fact that partnerships between parliamentarians, EU and UN Member State governments, institutions and civil society are vital for building support for the agreed goals and objectives of the action programme of the international conference on population and development as regards the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of gender equality, we have to make a joint commitment to pushing this issue forward, ensuring better representation of women in an effort to prevent war, restore peace and cope with post-conflict situations, taking into account that women can play a significant role in peacekeeping if they are properly supported and genuinely included.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to point out that the EU has a crucial role to play in advancing these objectives to achieve an equitable and lasting solution.

      <p sl="en">Before coming to this House, I represented West Belfast in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Shankill area of Belfast in local government.

      <p sl="ro">I do not believe that declarations are enough, especially declarations which convey a different picture of reality. I believe that action is needed and it is the European Union’s task, as part of the current security policy, to create an initial code of conduct to be used in both conflicts and post-conflict operations, although we have a convention, in the form of the Geneva Convention, which condemns violent conduct during conflicts. I believe that a code of conduct of this kind would provide added value for the European Union, marking a step towards resolving this issue.</p>

It is our duty to work for compliance with and the protection of the rights of all women, so that they can be fully integrated into society, regardless of their situation, origin or status.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Their role begins in the family, not only because they are irreplaceable in raising children to respect human dignity for all, but there are also women who, aware of a threat to their families, get involved in preventing and solving military conflicts.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I clearly agree with Parliament on a very large number of points. How could I fail to agree in particular with Mr Juvin’s and Mr Tarabella’s calls for the creation of the European External Action Service to represent a major opportunity to strengthen EU policy on women, peace and security? During the process of establishing the service, the ongoing challenge of ensuring greater representation of women at every level, including within personnel units, and especially at the highest level, must be recognised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton is very clearly working on this. She has taken some steps in this direction, for example, by appointing Rosalind Marsden as the EU’s first female Special Representative to Sudan. In September, she appointed 29 people to senior positions within the delegations, including seven female heads of delegation, which is nothing short of a 50% increase in the number of women at this level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time as the EU undertakes major efforts to strengthen its capabilities in relation to the participation of women, peace and security, we believe that it is also important to take steps to raise awareness within other organisations and countries. This goes hand in hand with specific training activities. Many of you have spoken on this issue too. Within the framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Union supports the United Nations in the implementation of resolutions on women, peace and security in countries and regions that are particularly affected, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Fergana Valley, which spans Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the European Union continues to believe in the importance of increased delegation of responsibilities at international level. The Union believes that the Security Council should establish a working group to examine the progress made in implementing resolution 1325 and to make recommendations to the Council in order to meet the challenges and remedy the shortcomings that exist and to speed up the implementation of that resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union has therefore called on the Security Council to redouble its efforts in the fight against impunity. Targeted and progressive measures should be imposed against any party to a conflict that is responsible for serious violations of women’s rights.</p>

On the contrary, impunity provides conditions conducive to the spread of this practice which is diametrically opposed to our values. I have repeatedly spoken out, along with others, against the acts of mass rape perpetrated in the Congo, Liberia and other conflict zones, especially in Africa. The thousands of women falling victim to sexual abuse and violence are also being condemned to bear in the future the social stigma and burden of terrible diseases, such as HIV.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The International Day against Violence against Women, which we mark on 25 November, must also remind us that women are victims of domestic violence, which is occurring with alarming frequency, marital rape, sexual harassment and human trafficking.

      <p sl="pl">Over the years, the traditional role of peace missions has changed. It is now not only monitoring ceasefire agreements or ensuring that borders between states are respected. Currently, missions are engaged in a range of ‘soft’ activities – promoting human rights and democracy in a wide variety of ways, supporting the organisation of elections and restoring the rule of law. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325, attention should be drawn to the particular role of women in these processes. In many cases, they are far better predisposed to carrying out the tasks of peace missions. Among other things, I am thinking, here, of work with the victims of sexually motivated violence and violence based on sexual discrimination. Women work in women’s prisons, they help with social reintegration and they also conduct numerous forms of training. We talk a lot about increasing the participation of women in politics and business. In none of these areas has it yet been possible to achieve full equality of opportunities. This is why it is necessary to return to these issues and look carefully at the way in which legislation which has been adopted is brought into force, so that on the 15th or 20th anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325, it will be possible to say that all of its provisions have been implemented.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mr Bernhard Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines (COM(2010)0372 – C7-0296/2010 – 2010 /0220(NLE)) (Α7-0324/2010).</p>

    <intervention id="2-042" speaker_id="1906" name="Bernhard Rapkay" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Almunia, and your offices. The impact assessment that you have presented is very good. It is based on facts, it is conclusive and it gets to the point.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a pity that the other members of the College of Commissioners have not read this impact assessment, because if they had read it, they would not have been able to present this proposal, which has nothing at all to do with the impact assessment. I wonder how the College of Commissioners picked the year, for example. There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment. The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018. That is what it must be.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it may be that they have also not understood the content. None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct. There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining. Of course, this is totally incorrect. It was a successor arrangement. I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002. This is when the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) expired after 50 years and a successor arrangement was needed, not only with regard to aid, but also other issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">If this had been a phasing out arrangement, what would have happened, for example, to the ECSC’s assets? It was not a phasing out arrangement, it was a successor arrangement. At the time, we agreed with good reason on a period of eight years for this successor arrangement, after which we would look at the issue again. Therefore, this argument is incorrect.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second argument which is put forward is the question of sustainability. We are all in favour of this and we know that coal, of course, produces large quantities of CO2 emissions. However, a decision made by the Commission cannot abolish the laws of science. What will happen next? Domestic coal will be replaced by imported coal. That is the only thing that will happen. Imported coal emits just the same amount of CO2 as domestic coal. The problem is simply that if we no longer have reference points, we will not be able to use them in the development of new, state-of-the-art technologies for mining and power stations. Europe is a leader in this area and has an export advantage. I do not believe that we should just give this up.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third argument is that aid is harmful and that the money would be better spent on other things. It is not possible to say anything against this argument or against the attitude of market radicals. You cannot oppose an ideology with facts. However, the statement that this would be too expensive, for example, should be looked at in the light of what it would really mean if mining were to be stopped abruptly, and 2014 would be an abrupt stop. It would result in an increase in the costs of combating unemployment and, above all, in the costs relating to long-term pit closures. This is a very complicated and complex subject. The costs of long-term pit closures continue to be incurred years and even decades after coal mining comes to an end. The costs have to be paid out of the public purse. However, some Member States have a system in place which ensures that the state is not responsible for these costs. Therefore, this argument also does not hold water. For this reason, I recommend that you think this over again as soon as possible and that you pay attention to what is said in the impact assessment. Otherwise, the result will be regional and socio-political distortions, which we do not want. This is why the 2018 proposal is highly sensible.</p>

    <intervention id="2-043" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, thank you very much to Mr Rapkay for his report on behalf of Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission has closely analysed both the report and the amendments proposed for this debate with great interest, and we have taken note of the fact that the report specifically supports extending the deadline for closing uncompetitive mines to 2018.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission is also aware that in recent debates that have taken place in the Permanent Representatives Committee (Coreper), the majority supported the 2018 deadline, as Mr Rapkay’s report suggests.</p>
      <p sl="es">When we prepared the proposal for a regulation and analysed this situation, we in the Commission were, of course, fully aware of the social and regional impact of the closure of coal mines in certain regions of the EU. However, when drawing up the regulation, we also took into account the fact that some of the mines are not competitive and have only survived so far thanks to constant injections of public money and public subsidies. Therefore, in our proposal for a regulation, we allowed the Member States to grant additional operating aid, but on this occasion, for the specific purpose of facilitating the gradual closure of uncompetitive mines.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to discuss three points that are considered in the report.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the proposal to grant operating aid or investment in order to make the mines competitive. There was already a similar provision in the previous regulation concerning aid to the sector. However, the previous regulation largely failed to achieve the desired effects and, rather than guiding the coal mines towards profitability, it created a moral hazard to some extent.</p>
      <p sl="es">The mines were subsidised in the vain hope of achieving profitability. Now we have to deal with the consequences: we need to extend this special system for coal production because the mines concerned have not achieved profitability, nor have they been closed.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, the mines that have credible forecasts of profitability do not need State aid and can obtain the required capital from the capital or financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I would like to explain why, in our proposal, we consider it to be necessary to have a plan to minimise the effects on the environment. Article 3(1) of our proposal mentions this point.</p>
      <p sl="es">State aid distorts competition. Therefore, the treaty contains provisions for declaring it incompatible in a whole range of cases. Operating aid can only be authorised if it is likely to have positive effects. Our regulation proposes a plan to mitigate the environmental impact of the use of coal in order to offset the negative effects of the aid.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, my third point is that when the objective of the operating aid is to contribute to a transition towards closing uncompetitive mines, it is clear that this closure must be gradual and cannot take place only when the deadline arrives. This gradual nature must be clearly set out in the closure plan, and the plan must also include a diminishing proportion of that aid during the transition period.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our proposal therefore establishes a linear reduction in aid by a percentage that clearly aims for the removal of aid at the end of the transition period.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having said all this, I would once again like to thank Mr Rapkay and everyone who contributed to the report that we are considering. We will consider Parliament’s position on the report, and we are continuing the debates in the Council, naturally in consultation with the Belgian Presidency. In light of Parliament’s position and based on what the Council’s position turns out to be, the Commission will, of course, give its opinion in the next few weeks.</p>

    <intervention id="2-044" speaker_id="28225" name="Herbert Reul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, no one disputes the fact that coal is an important part of our energy supply. It is also indisputable that the mining industry must be competitive and that subsidising it is not the correct approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question now is whether 2014 or 2018 is the right deadline. Mr Rapkay put forward a number of intelligent arguments which I will not repeat. I have only one request to the Commission. In all the committees in Parliament which were involved, there is majority support for making competitiveness a criterion. When it comes to the deadline, we must simply ensure that there is the necessary flexibility to allow the Member States to keep the pressure on the people, the jobs and the economic structures at a manageable level. The only argument which has been mentioned and which, incidentally, conflicts with the Commission’s impact statement that initially seemed to be in favour of 2018, was that environmental policy reasons could play a role here. I would like to emphasise once again that it makes no difference to the climate whether we burn imported or domestic coal. My request to the Commissioner is to consider, if Parliament and the Council can come up with new arguments of this kind, whether this four-year deadline could lead to the Commission being a little more flexible. This is how I understood the reference just now to the Commission considering the issue and I am grateful for this.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, on behalf of the REGI Committee, we welcome the Commission proposal, although we have recommended certain amendments. We also recommended extending the deadline for closing uncompetitive mines. Without this change, there would be a risk that entire regions affected by mine closures would fall into poverty and would face serious social problems.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Among other things, we also proposed adjusting the use of cohesion resources for regions affected in this way. The committee also believes that the closure of uncompetitive mines is not the only acceptable way of using State aid for such mines, as it should also be used to facilitate development targeted on achieving competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="cs">If a mine becomes competitive by a certain date, that is surely a desirable situation, which is in the interests both of the region concerned and, eventually, the Union as a whole. The importance of coal-fired power stations rests, among other things, on the fact that they are practically the only plants capable of responding immediately and flexibly through increased production when there is a sudden increase in demand for electricity, independently of other factors. If the greater energy security of the Union is to be more than just an empty slogan, we cannot manage without stable and competitive coal mines and a coal industry.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like, first of all, to encourage Mr Almunia to stick with his original proposal of 2018. This proposal was well-founded and was based on economic, regional, social and energy policy grounds.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not understand why the College of Commissioners has introduced environmental reasons which are completely irrelevant. As previous speakers have said, it makes no difference whether we burn imported coal or coal that we have mined and subsidised ourselves. Our climate footprint is largely the same in both cases. In fact, it is probably much worse for imported coal because this has to be transported here from Canada, Australia or other regions of the world. This is why the justification is wrong. I would like to thank Mr Rapkay for producing this proposal in close cooperation with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). I believe that it concerns a Council regulation. There is a loophole in the Treaty of Lisbon which means that regulations on the basis of competition law do not form part of Parliament’s codecision procedure. Instead, the process, which does not involve a proper assessment, is still based on Regulation No 17 dating back to 1965. Therefore, we now need – at least as far as our statement is concerned – a broad majority vote, so that coal, which is one of the most important energy sources still available to us in Europe, remains competitive in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our group will give Mr Rapkay’s report its unrestricted support. We want to encourage Mr Almunia to prompt the Commission to put forward a new proposal of 2018 and we want to amend two points in the report that has been adopted. One of these concerns the question of the way in which the aid is to be gradually reduced. We are of the opinion that this should be left to the Member States over this eight-year period.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point concerns the fact that the regulation as a whole will be phased out in 2030. That is also the stage which the Council’s discussions have reached on this regulation. Only when Parliament makes a clear decision in favour of 2018 will we be able to carry out an appropriate evaluation of the social, political, energy policy, economic and regional grounds.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, this is not a straightforward matter. It is therefore important for us in Parliament to establish a well-balanced position. There are two main aspects to take into consideration. On the one hand, it is unreasonable, in the long term, to continue to keep this uncompetitive form of mining alive artificially. For reasons relating to both the environment and competition, it is unsustainable to use public subsidy programmes to ensure that unprofitable coal mining continues. It is therefore logical for the subsidies for this activity now to be phased out.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the other hand, the abolition of subsidies will have a huge impact, not only on the tens of thousands of coal miners who will be forced to look for new jobs, but also on their families and everyone else who depends on mining. It will be a very difficult adjustment for the people living in the regions affected. Weighing up these two aspects is not easy. Nevertheless, I think the Commission has found a reasonable balance in its proposal. The subsidies will be discontinued, but this will be carefully managed, taking into consideration both jobs and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The regions concerned will suffer a difficult setback when the subsidies are discontinued but, at the same time, the proposal provides the opportunity for comprehensive social and environmental measures with a view to making this regional adjustment process as efficient as possible. It is extremely important for all of these opportunities to be fully utilised by national and regional authorities. Large-scale investment in active labour market initiatives and comprehensive environmental restoration measures is essential if the end result is to be acceptable for these regions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">So far, the debate has focused on three issues. Firstly, the argument has been put forward that the coal mines that become competitive during the closure period should be able to continue to operate. In my opinion, it would be wrong to include this option, because the aid that is to be granted must be used in the right way and based on definitive closure. Secondly, an end date for the closure aid has been discussed. In this regard, it is important to note that the current regulation has been in existence since 2002 and that everyone was aware that the exemptions from the competition rules would expire this year. There was therefore nothing very surprising in this. I can be flexible when it comes to the exact year. Thirdly, opinions have been divided regarding the environmental and sustainability elements in Parliament’s position. I believe that these elements should be as clear as possible, and they should definitely be more prominent than they are in the text produced by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It is very important that we send out the right signal in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="de">We are talking about the seventh extension of the special State aid regime. Mr Rapkay himself has indicated that he was rapporteur back in 2002. Who will give us a guarantee that we are not going to have the same debate in 2018? Because the reasons that were valid back in 2002 that are valid today, will still be valid in 2018. Therefore, my group, without reserve, endorses the position of the Commission. We have requested a separate vote on Amendments 25 and 27, and we call on all colleagues in the two big groups to vote against those amendments and support the position of the Commission to phase out the support by 2014.</p>
      <p sl="de">I know that votes took place in the different committees, but I also know that there are many colleagues in the two big groups who feel deeply uncomfortable with the current position. I think they should realise that they have all the freedom in the world to vote according to their conscience, because it is not actually the European Parliament that decides. So they should vote in order to state their views.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are not negotiating; we do not have to compromise. We can give a very strong political signal in support of the Commission, and therefore I think this European Parliament should act as a counterweight to the very strong political pressure from the Member States on the Commission and show that this Parliament is looking to the future and not to the past.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has no objection to public funds being invested, provided that they act as a catalyst for the transformation that our society, our industry, our economy must go through to become fairer and, above all, more sustainable. We must remember that aid for uncompetitive coal mines goes against these objectives. It props up an industry that is not sustainable either economically – otherwise it would not need subsidies – or environmentally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mrs in ’t Veld emphasised just now, for several decades, the coal industry has been calling for this transition to be extended, with no end in sight. Equally, my fellow German Members, for several decades, many European countries have been striving to put an end to what is an unsustainable industry. This is true of my country, France, and it is true of many other countries too. We therefore support the Commission’s proposal and, by extension, the proposal for subsidies to be used so that the workers concerned can be redeployed in a decent and dignified fashion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, under the pressure of what you have heard today, the Commission is preparing to beat a rather inglorious retreat, Mr Almunia, under the pressure exerted by, among others, your colleague Mr Oettinger, whose behaviour in this matter has not been that of a Member of a College responsible for defending the general interest, but of an official representative of the specific, sectoral interests of one particular country, Germany. What is more, he makes no secret of it!</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I should like to say to you that, as long as the European Union, as long as the Member States put all their energies into supporting industries of the past, with public money, which – and I hope the Irish crisis reminds us of this – has become extremely scarce, as long as we support, with this public money, 19th-century industries, we will not enable Europe to take the lead in 21st-century industries. Meanwhile, the world is changing, and changing fast.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the proposal presented by the European Commission was evidently written under the dictates of climate policy and without consideration of the social consequences – particularly the consequences in the field of energy – in countries such as Germany, Spain and Poland. We must remember that the world coal market is changing before our eyes. Demand for coal, and the price of coal, are rising. Therefore, mines which today are unprofitable, will, perhaps, be profitable in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The departure from coal also presents very serious problems for energy security in such countries as Poland, which generate as much as 95% of their electricity from coal. The departure from coal in such situations can involve only one alternative – a still greater dependence on gas, which is imported from only one direction. Therefore, before we decide on political pressure in favour of abandoning coal in such cases, we should ensure diversification and also security of gas supply, because this is, today, the only real alternative for the energy sector in countries which use coal for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These are the reasons why we will support the compromises presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, where we have proposed that the regulation give the possibility to national budgets – which are not EU budgets, after all – to maintain mines in countries in which this is necessary, and also the compromise which suggests that the regulation could be in force until 2030. I think the initial proposals of the European Commission were significantly closer to precisely this position. Only at the final stage did the European Commission decide to propose the unrealistic deadline of 2014.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it is not only justifiable for us to continue supporting the coal industry, but, in my opinion, it is also absolutely essential. We must go on providing support not only until 2014, but also beyond that time. It is our duty to protect the citizens of the European Union from the many negative impacts of globalisation. This also includes offering workers in industries which are not fully competitive on the world market long-term retraining to allow them to take on other jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">You do not need to be an expert to realise that specialised workers are needed in the mining industry. Many miners work in the pits for their entire lives. Therefore, in my opinion, we need plenty of time in order to be able to offer all of them new jobs. It may no longer be sensible to give older miners the option of retraining. We must enable mining regions to become gradually less dependent on the mining industry without their prosperity being significantly reduced. These regions still have considerable economic potential if they are given the opportunity of restructuring their economies. The drastic reduction in the subsidies for coal mining over recent years has represented an ordeal for many mining regions. A number of areas were not able to react quickly enough to the changes in economic conditions because of their strong links with the mining industry. The result has been increased poverty. This does not have to be the case. We can protect many European regions from major economic and social damage and, therefore, we must vote in favour of these regulations.</p>

We must have a goal when it comes to the automotive industry, the engineering industry and the medical industry. In order to be successful we need to transform our economy to enable it to meet the demands of modern competition and the global economy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In light of this, I have serious doubts about the intention now to extend the state subsidies for unprofitable coal mines. It will mean that, at state level, we will be tying up money in undertakings which are not profitable, which are unable to support the jobs that we are talking about and which will not help to improve the environment. It will also mean that the transformation we need in order to be able to become truly competitive will be slower. It will mean that we fail to develop within other areas and also that, in a few years time, people will still be employed in industries that do not offer long-term security and the opportunity to make a living, and those regions that we are now talking about will still remain dependent on coal mining in what are unprofitable coal mines.</p>

I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date. The cost of each job in the coal mining industry is much higher than the average. This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future. Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I think that both the mine closure proposal and the suggestion to reduce subsidies would be too premature and that they would have undesirable socio-economic and regional repercussions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We must not forget that Europe’s mining sector provides approximately 100 000 jobs, 42 000 in coal mining and 55 000 in related sectors, and that certain regions in Europe are totally dependent economically on this sector. A large number of people in these regions work in mines or have jobs relating to this sector.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These measures could have adverse consequences, to the extent of leaving communities in absolute poverty. This is why a strategy for retraining the workers affected by the mine closure plans must be devised quickly.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, special support is required from the European Union’s Structural Funds in order to provide mutual assistance to the regions which will suffer as a result of these measures. In addition, mine workers and their families may lose their confidence in the political process where such decisions are made which affect them directly, if they are made at an inappropriate time.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We need to focus our attention just as much on sparsely populated regions, which will suffer the most in socio-economic terms. I do not believe that 2014 is a realistic deadline for closing the mines. On the other hand, the deadline of 2020 specifically proposed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not receive sufficient positive feedback. This is why I think that we can find common ground with 2018.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to mention another point, which is that the coal industry is an integral part of European policy and is the EU’s own source, thereby guaranteeing supply security. A transition period is required which will allow these mines, and those mines which could become competitive, to become gradually more competitive, in order to ensure access to European coal and avoid an adverse socio-economic impact.</p>

      <p sl="cs">We are talking here about regions that will be, or might be, affected by a high level of unemployment, but, on the other hand, we need to remember the regions that have already gone through restructuring in this sector of the economy, and which have endured high unemployment and coped with it.

      <p sl="es">Subsidies are not a general route to competitiveness, but making European coal competitive through subsidies is strategically necessary, first of all, because 60% of European energy is imported, and out of the remaining 40%, a large proportion is nuclear – which the majority of this House does not support – and secondly, because of price increases: the European coal price is moving closer and closer to the international coal price.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, I would like to ask you: what is competitive coal? Ask yourselves whether all the coal that the European Union imports includes the social and safety costs of the mines that are included in the cost of European coal. Is this the model that many of you want for Europe? Do you agree with the importation of products from outside our continent that do not comply with the principles of Union preference and do not incorporate social rights? Do you reject this same idea for European coal?</p>
      <p sl="es">The longer this period is, the better, so that we can introduce the clean combustion and storage technologies that already exist in the European Union.

The coal mining sector provides 280 000 jobs in the European Union, especially in mono-industry areas. This is why it is important for the Union to supply the largest proportion possible of its coal requirements from domestic production, obviously at a competitive price, based on streamlining the coal extraction and processing procedure.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unless State aid is granted, production will fall by 20%, resulting in 100 000 lost jobs. State aid for the hard coal industry is an absolute necessity for uncompetitive mines. They are uncompetitive due to their obsolete technical equipment. State aid would allow these facilities to be retrofitted to ensure job security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Compared with the Commission’s proposal, we are in favour of moving the mine closure deadline.

In other words, the argument does not make sense, whichever way you look at it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, this cannot be continued after 2018, for example, in Germany’s case, because the treaty, which applies to those involved and not just to the state, requires everything to come to an end in 2018, so that the long-term costs of pit closures do not have to be borne by the state.

We should also prevent imports of subsidised coal from abroad. Thirdly, we should prevent any interference from lobbyists. I would like to mention an example from the Russian Federation, where the oil lobby has brought about the closure of mines in the Vorkuta region, with disastrous social consequences. This must not happen in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, in order to mitigate the social and energy impact and to ensure secure energy reserves, we have tabled three amendments in plenary with the following aims: firstly, for the overall volume of aid per year to diminish, but with no percentage limit or limit per business. In this respect, we are grateful for Mr Langen’s position regarding removing fixed references and each Member State being able to decide according to their interests.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second aim is for aid to cover exceptional costs to be extended to 2030. Such proposals will help to alleviate the energy dependency of numerous EU countries, including Spain. They would ensure the continuation of indigenous production and the preservation of thousands of jobs on which significant regions of Spain and of Europe as a whole are largely dependent.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I, too, think that it is of paramount importance for the transition period to be as long as possible – 2018, as has been proposed. I suggested longer still for the closure of uncompetitive mines or possibly for making some of them profitable, as the majority of the population in mining areas are involved in this activity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is absolutely imperative to have plans for professional retraining and socio-economic recovery. Closing the mines prior to fully implementing these plans will result in extremely severe social problems A long time is required to implement plans for professional retraining and cleaning up these areas environmentally. During the current crisis in particular, it would be appropriate also to apply to the European Structural Funds, given the social, economic and environmental importance to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We are in a global recession and the European Union is in crisis. No one believes that we have emerged from this crisis yet, with many Member States still facing the reality of recession. Under these circumstances, I do not believe that we – in this Parliament – need to contribute to the situation by adding a further 100 000 unemployed to those we currently have in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, we are discussing a new European energy strategy – another background factor. I believe that our approach in this new strategy must not be to increase our dependency on a single hydrocarbon source, but to increase our economic independence.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, the 21st century economy has been mentioned. I believe indeed that we need to be involved with this economy but, at the same time, we must focus on diversifying current potential. In this respect, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in view of the specific nature of the regulation which we are debating, today, let us not forget that there are Member States of the European Union whose energy production is based mainly on coal. Therefore, the changes proposed during work on the regulation must be put into effect in a way which allows the speed of change to be adapted to the possibilities of absorption by the citizens and social structures. I welcome the compromise which has been achieved. In view of the role of coal in ensuring energy security, it is necessary to stabilise its extraction at the level required. The role of coal as a fuel in the energy balance will continue to be crucial for the energy sector by stabilising Europe’s energy security. I hope the Council will share our concern and listen carefully to the position agreed by the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to two points. One of them concerns competitiveness, which is raised in a number of different areas of the report. I would like to ask you to remember how many mining accidents we hear about in the media. This is due to the fact that mining and, in particular, coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately, the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared with those in German or other European pits. This may seem like overstating the case, but personally, I do not think much of competitiveness which is bought at the expense of miners’ lives. However, if we are looking at the consequences for industrial policy of an early exit from coal mining, I would like to say that the European mining equipment industry is competitive. I would like to invite all those people who believe that mining is an industry of the past and, in particular, Mr Klinz, to pay a visit to a mine. They will soon realise that mining uses high-tech solutions and that it is a question of whether or not we want this industry to continue to be profitable. I know that this is not what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wants. I am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-070" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, I repeat what I said in my opening speech: the Commission and I are taking very good note of all the arguments that have been put forward here by all of you, and we will take very good note of Parliament’s position once Mr Rapkay’s report is adopted.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that we need to distinguish – as practically all the speeches have done – between coal as a primary energy source and the regulation to govern public aid for uncompetitive coal mines, which is a different thing.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our proposal, which we are debating today and which the Council will debate in the next few weeks, deals with the second issue, in other words, uncompetitive coal mining rather than the use of coal, which is a separate debate that we have had and will, of course, continue to have in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our position is that we need to bring an end to uncompetitive coal mining that requires continuous use of public subsidies, within a fixed period. This position is clear, and it is not the first time that it has been expressed. As some of you have recalled, it dates back a long way. The problem is that the deadlines that were established over time have not been respected by everyone. The aim of our proposal is to ensure that these deadlines are respected once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is a time when, unlike the context in which past debates took place, we have to take into consideration aid for coal mining. We need to take into account two additional issues. The first is the challenge of climate change, which we have debated on numerous occasions and for which the European Union has very specific targets. The second issue is the impact of the crisis and the resulting borrowing on government budgets, budgets at the national level, as this is placing even more pressure on public finances.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are not, however, the only issues that should be considered. We also have to consider – as you have in practically all your speeches – what the deadline should be for removing public aid for coal mining under non-competitive conditions.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a debate around this issue, and we have listened to the different positions in the debate in Parliament. There is also a debate in the Council, and we are going to wait for the Council meeting at the beginning of December to see what the Council’s position is. There has certainly been a debate in the Commission, and there will be another.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you know – as Mr Langen mentioned earlier – this is a Council regulation. Parliament’s opinion is very important, but the treaty states that, on matters of public aid, the regulation is a Council regulation. The Council will establish its position. Currently – at the last meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee – it has a majority position in favour of a deadline for the permanent removal of this aid in 2018, which is longer than the Commission’s proposal. Our rules state, however, that unless the Council decides unanimously, the Commission proposal cannot be legally modified.</p>
      <p sl="es">Whatever decision the Council reaches, it is practically certain that it will not be unanimous, but the Commission is going to listen very carefully to the Council’s position, just as it is listening very carefully to Parliament’s arguments and will listen to Parliament’s position when it votes. The Commission will adopt its final position based on its analysis of the respective positions of the Council, according to its prerogatives established in the treaty, and also of Parliament, and based on the debate on the Rapkay report.</p>
      <p sl="es">I just have to say that the Commission does not agree with the arguments in favour of unlimited aid for uncompetitive coal mining and would like to remind you that, if there were no new coal regulation based on the Commission’s proposal, what would enter into force from 1 January 2011 would be the general State aid framework, which is considerably stricter than the Commission’s proposal, the proposal that will emerge from the debates in the Council, or the opinion that will emerge from Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Almunia, that is exactly the problem. You are right when you confirm to Mr Lange that it is a Council regulation. However, it also depends on whether the Commission hears the arguments put forward in the Council and here in Parliament. You must drop this very stringent proposal, as you have done, so that it is possible for a sensible, democratic approach to be taken, which involves a majority decision that does not require unanimity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make a second remark to Mr Chatzimarkakis. The review clause which you referred to is completely irrelevant in this case. The disputes which took place in Germany were only intended to save the face of the Minister for Economic Affairs there, nothing more. Now, I would like to look at the concern expressed by Mr Almunia. No one here and not even the report itself is questioning the fact that this is a phasing out arrangement, Mr Almunia. Whether it is sensible in terms of energy policy or technology is another question. What Mr Geier said is absolutely correct, but we are not calling that into question. The only question is whether we should do this relatively abruptly in 2014 or whether there are sensible transitional arrangements for 2018. Otherwise, we are not questioning anything. The situation is not as described by Mr Lambert, for example, who read out his speech and then left. He should have stayed here, because he might have learned something. It is not the case that there are Member States who have done nothing at all. That is not true of Spain, of Poland, of Romania or of Germany. In 1990, more than 200 000 people were working in the mining industry in Germany. Now, 20 years later, the figure is around 20 000. This represents a drop of 90%, leaving only 10% of the jobs still in place. There have been a number of pit closures between 2002 and the present day during the period of this regulation, which is still in force. Let us not behave as if nothing has happened.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question is whether or not we need a sensible transitional period to be able to achieve this without causing socio-political damage. I can only say, yes, we do need one. This four-year period should not be an issue, because no one is calling that into question anyway. Please take that message back to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="ro">While drafting this document, the rapporteur has achieved an important success – finding an answer to two questions: one concerning the environment and the other social protection. From Romania’s perspective, and I believe that this is a point of view also shared by Germany, Poland, Spain or Hungary, the mining industry is an important component of the domestic economy. The coal mine closures may have a major social impact, contributing to the rise in unemployment and exacerbating the depopulation of regions which only have one industry – mining. At the same time, mine closures will also have a significant impact on the energy sector. I know that all these are arguments for and against this measure. However, the current reality leads us to a single conclusion: to extend the deadline for closing coal mines which are not competitive in order to support them in finding viable alternatives for all those involved in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Commission is trying – at any price and in a way which is not justified by economic rationale – to reduce coal extraction. These efforts have been artificially stimulated by the increase in costs of generating energy in coal-fired power stations. I refer to the costs of emissions. It is a policy which undermines the economic foundations of those countries in which most energy is derived from coal. Such a strategy testifies to a lack of understanding of the need to have a coherent fuel and energy policy which prefers economic effectiveness and competitiveness. It also testifies to the lack of a unified energy policy guaranteeing security of energy supply and a lack of regulations based on uniform criteria for the entire common market, which would lead to fair competition while retaining minimum social costs. We are dealing, today, with a brutal violation of those principles.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question is, what kind of industry does the Union need – an industry which benefits the Union, or one which is supranational, corporate and which invests its taxes in tax havens? Primary industries and power generation require many years of investment and concentration of capital, which means they need to be subsidised. Furthermore, they do not have to be profitable at any price. Cheap energy and fuel are essential for secondary industry to be competitive, including the machine industry. So we are talking about net profitability. I would like to say that the Union’s economic problems during the crisis are not only the result of dishonest global financial speculations, but there is also a lack of a sound, uniform and fair industrial policy in the Union itself, particularly a fuel and energy policy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">There are several arguments against such a rapid discontinuation of subsidies. I refer primarily to social and economic consequences on a regional scale. It is important that we spend subsidies to facilitate mine closures properly: to ensure that the employees concerned are retrained and redeployed in other sectors of the labour market. Appropriate environmental rehabilitation is also imperative. Without these, there is a risk that the EU will save less money on discontinued subsidies than it will have to spend on damage mitigation. It must be considered carefully whether it is useful to close coal mines at all, if all we achieve in doing so is that the remaining power plants must substitute domestic coal with coal imported from outside the common market.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Is it expedient to close coal-fired power plants, one of the cheapest sources of electricity, when the alarming signs of energy shortage are beginning to be noticeable around the world? We must also think of the increasing energy demands of the European Union, as well as the role of coal in energy security. We must not allow facilities like the Hungarian Vértes Power Plant and the Oroszlány mine to close without carefully drafted and detailed plans. These plans must resolve the situation of the employees, the rehabilitation of the environment, and must demonstrate, through well-founded impact assessments, that closure is inevitable and represents the best option to reduce pollutant emissions. The green growth programme must not entail any measures that would cause severe economic and social problems.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European Union’s attempt to reduce the use of coal is only right and proper. Since the long-term aim for Europe and the human race is non-dependence on fossil fuels, we need to realise that European coal mines will, sooner or later, have to adapt to change. Globalisation means that there will be significant price pressures on coal. For this reason, production will transfer to countries where labour is cheaper and the areas in the EU where coal is produced will see jobs and income drain away, as mines can no longer respond to the competition. Although this is an unwelcome development, the actions of the authorities cannot conflict with the basic principles of the market economy. Unprofitable production should not be kept on a life support machine forever. We must remember that structural change on this scale will inevitably have far-reaching and dramatic social consequences. Mine closures often mean the end of an area’s main source of livelihood. This is reflected in the ability of cities and towns to provide their residents with services and the decline of entire communities. It is in everyone’s interest if major social changes such as those associated with the gradual closure of mines take place with the right controls in place and over a sufficient period of transition. Coal will nevertheless play a key role in our lives in the foreseeable future. It will still be needed, for example, in the steel industry, and studies of its use as a raw material for polymers have been encouraging. Furthermore, an excellent cost-benefit ratio has been achieved with combined heat and power using coal. We should not therefore succumb to the illusion that winding down coal mines is a sort of political end in itself. In the future, a profitable mining industry must be a possibility – in the EU too.</p>

      <p sl="es">There are various reasons for supporting coal aid: strategic reasons, regional sustainability reasons and social reasons.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the strategic reasons, we need to take into account the fact that the market is changing rapidly. Therefore, abandoning coal without having a viable alternative would not be appropriate. The environmental argument is not relevant either, as imported coal is equally as polluting as indigenous coal. Moreover, we should not forget that, on many occasions, the mines from which we import coal do not comply with social rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to regional sustainability, in many cases, the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region, and we risk turning our lands into deserts.</p>
      <p sl="es">The final and most important reason is the more than 180 000 families that could be affected. In Spain, in my region of Aragon, we are pioneers of renewable energy sources, with almost 60% energy independence. The only resource that we can store is coal, and we need more time in order to improve our technologies and apply them to mining, thus transforming our indigenous coal into clean, sustainable coal.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Despite all the fine speeches on climate, Europe will still be clinging onto its coal-black past by adopting this report. Under the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU would like to move swiftly towards a low emissions future based on renewable forms of energy. These will merely be words, however, if, in the future, Parliament allows the Member States to squander billions on its coal mines.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The current rules on aid would have expired in December, but in the Commission’s proposals, they would be extended until 2014. The coal-black gloom is intensified by the fact that Parliament wants the rules on aid to be extended all the way to 2018. Two years ago, aid from the EU Member States to industry that produced and used hard coal, that is to say, anthracite, was as much as EUR 2.9 billion. That only shows that there is still many times more aid for fossil fuels than there is for renewable energy sources, and this despite the fact that our targets on climate would call for just the opposite policy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honoured guests and friends. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">This is not President Saakashvili’s first visit to the European Parliament. He was with us four years ago, and he was also in Brussels in 2004, just after being elected President of Georgia. Today is a special day – today, 23 November, is the seventh anniversary of the Rose Revolution, the bloodless watershed which brought change to the situation not only in Georgia but the whole region of the South Caucasus. Mr President, for almost 60 years, the European Union has been moving in the direction which Georgia has now also chosen – that of lasting peace, welfare and unthreatened liberty. President Saakashvili received his initial education in Kiev. He then studied at European and American universities, and has always been associated with Strasbourg – he studied here, has received honours here and it was also here, as far as I know, that he met his future wife. So it is a special place for Mr Saakashvili.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The last seven years have not been easy for Georgia. Georgia’s territorial integrity has been violated. I would like to recall that in May this year, we adopted a resolution calling on Russia to respect the conditions of the ceasefire and to withdraw its forces from Georgian territory.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Four years ago, Mr Saakashvili said in this Chamber that Georgians are not only one of the oldest nations of Europe, but that they are also intensely interested in European integration. They regard this as the kind of approach to international affairs which they prefer. I am sure this enthusiasm is no less today than four years ago. We, here in the European Parliament and the European Union, attach great importance to democratisation. The standards of democratisation and democracy are very high, and the standards of the free market are also high. Human rights, the rule of law and freedom of the press all require reforms – reforms of the constitutional system, electoral law and the justice system. A moment ago, I was talking about these matters with the President of Georgia, and we agreed that it is not an easy process, but that it is essential if we are to be similar to each other and if we are to work more easily with each other.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I am pleased, too, that Georgia has quickly overcome the economic crisis. The European Union also played a part in this – we extended a helping hand. Today, Georgia is again at a stage of rapid economic growth. We in the European Union are keen that Georgia should be stable and that it should develop well, but we are also keen for this to happen in the entire region of the South Caucasus. Georgia could be the perfect model of transition to a democratic and free market system, full of protection for human rights and the operation of the rule of law. This is why what Mr Saakashvili has to propose to us and to say, today, is so important. We are glad you are with us, and we would like to ask you to speak. The floor is yours, Mr President.</p>

    <intervention id="2-115" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Mikheil Saakashvili" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">President of Georgia. – Mr President, I am humbled by the immense honour that your invitation signifies for my country, and I would like to thank you and all the political groups for this exceptional opportunity. Mr President, as we noted in our preliminary discussions, I was last here four years ago, so it is like the Olympic Games. I have come back four years later. Hopefully, I will perform better this time than last time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I came here to deliver a message of hope and to make a solemn pledge. I came here to affirm that peace – a just and lasting peace – is possible in my region, and that we need Europe to contribute to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">For centuries, the Caucasian Mountains have been a geopolitical mystery and a beguiling paradox: a region where individuals and souls were free, but where citizens were oppressed; where cultures were tolerant, but where governments created artificial divisions; where people never cease to feel deeply European, but where walls erected by empires turned Europe into a faraway mirage; where men and women were striving for peace, but wars seemed unavoidable.</p>
      <p sl="en">I came here to tell you that we must put an end to those times, that cooperation must replace rivalry, and that negotiations must prevail over the rhetoric of war.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all the troubled corners of our world, the European Parliament is a symbol of hope. It is striking proof that even the cruellest of conflicts can be overcome and that peace is worth any political risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">This very place would not exist if, in the middle of ruins, surrounded by death and legitimate claims for revenge, brave leaders did not choose to end centuries of wars by launching the most ambitious and fascinating political experiment of our time: European unification. This Parliament, which is divided not by nationality, but into political groups – fulfils the vision so eloquently expressed by Victor Hugo at the 1849 International Peace Congress in Paris.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to quote the great poet in his own language:</p>
      <p sl="fr">The day will come when all of you, all the nations of the continent, without losing your distinctive qualities or your glorious individuality, merge into a greater union, and embody European fraternity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The day will come when the only battlefields are markets open to trade and minds open to ideas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The day will come when cannonballs and bombs are replaced by votes, by the universal suffrage of the peoples, by the venerable arbitration of a great sovereign senate which will be to Europe what Parliament is to the United Kingdom, what the Diet is to Germany and what the Legislative Assembly is to France.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Most of Hugo’s contemporaries thought he was an infantile dreamer, even when he gave this speech. It took more than a hundred years and two world wars for history to hear his voice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for Hugo’s voice to be echoed and heard in my region as well. It is high time for this voice of brotherhood to overcome the sounds of cannons and calls of hatred. It is high time for the European peace to be extended to the Caucasus.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">And it is our responsibility, as political leaders, to conceive bold initiatives in order to make this happen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, exactly seven years ago, the Rose Revolution initiated a new journey towards the European family of an old nation, my beloved Georgia. On 23 November 2003, hundreds of thousands of citizens of all regional, religious and social backgrounds peacefully took over the streets and the Parliament. Not a single window was broken and not a single thing was stolen from the building. They did more than overthrow a corrupt, backward-looking regime. They triggered what economists in London some weeks ago called a mental revolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As some of you in this Assembly know well, there have been two ways of getting out from communist regimes after the liberating collapse of the USSR – the European one and the nationalistic one: the rule of law and the rule of fear. To sum up: Václav Havel and Slobodan Milošević.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once the tyranny of the Party was over, the divisions, the corruption, the verticality, the bureaucracy, the cynicism and the authoritarianism that were the pillars of Soviet society remained intact. Seven years ago, Georgia was formally an independent state, but it was still part of this world of fear and hatred. The borders of the Soviet mentality were not abolished, and the Soviet Union still existed in the minds and the souls of the people. Only a mental revolution could lead to the European transformation of our societies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the message that we Georgians brought to this region. This is the message that unleashed so much anger towards us among those nostalgic for the Empire, but this is the message that turned Georgia into a laboratory of reforms for our region. When we led the Rose Revolution, we were members of student organisations, opposition parties and civil society groups, all united by a single dream: to turn a dysfunctional post-Soviet country crippled beyond imagining by corruption and crime into a European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the Soviet Union was based on the principle of the right to rule. People were artificially opposed to each other at every level of society and in every field. In every republic, the different religious, social and ethnic groups were made to be constant rivals, and politics was understood as an art of manipulation, fear and hatred. This explains why former communist leaders turned so easily into nationalists – in the Balkans as well as in the Caucasus, in eastern Europe as well as in Russia. Seven years ago, Georgia was still divided into isolated communities which feared each other. Some extremists were using the weakness of the State to reject minorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our first task was therefore to embrace multiculturalism and differences. We have developed an affirmative action programme in all spheres, from higher education to law enforcement bodies. The Soviet Union had another characteristic – absolute centralisation. Seven years ago, Georgia was still centred completely on its capital, and we initiated a vast decentralisation programme, invested in regional development infrastructures and spectacularly empowered local authorities. As a result, regions that were once abandoned became the most striking examples of our development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Until the Rose Revolution, all key regional principles were appointed by the President, so while others were restoring the famous vertical power cancelling the autonomy of all the regions, we systematically transferred power to regionally elected bodies. This policy has recently led to the first direct election of the mayor of the capital Tbilisi – last May – and the decision to move the Constitutional Court to the city of Batumi and the Parliament to Georgia’s second-biggest city – Kutaisi – in the centre of Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Soviet Union was all about control and corruption – an overweight and inefficient state. Our first step was therefore to dissolve the KGB and fire the entire police force …</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">… as well as customs officers and tax agents, but also to open our economy and our educational system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The vision that guided all these steps was captured by a single symbol. Beside every Georgian flag in every official building, we installed a European flag. We did this to show where we were aiming to take Georgia with our reforms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, our peaceful revolution has had its share of failures and shortcomings. Of course, we have made mistakes but, as the great inventor of European cosmopolitanism and one of my favourite philosophers, Immanuel Kant, wrote about the French revolution, ‘You cannot be ready to be free until you are actually free’. What Immanuel Kant meant, ladies and gentlemen, is that no book can teach you in advance how to govern – or even behave – in freedom. You can only learn this from your own successes and failures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have had failures and we have learnt from them, but we have also had surprising successes. Georgia has just been singled out by the World Bank as the number one economic reformer in the world over the last five years and now ranks twelfth in the world and number one in central and eastern Europe – and certainly in the post-Soviet world – for ease of doing business. Once the epicentre of the post-Soviet mafia, Georgia made more progress against corruption than any other country in the world from 2004 to 2009, according to the EBRD and Transparency International. Indeed, on the TI listing, Georgia went up about 70 places and, by coincidence, around that time, Russia went down about 70 places. We met in the middle and I do not remember them saying hello, but that is what happened.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I value these rankings only because they reflect and rebuild the social and moral transformation that happened in my country – the mental revolution to which I referred earlier. Georgian citizens have stopped thinking of their state and country as a post-Soviet state. They see it, judge it and criticise it as a European democracy. Such a change goes far beyond the leaders and parties that led the Rose Revolution. It is something that nobody owns and nobody can suppress, neither us nor anybody else.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Such a revolution leads to this amazing fact in our part of the world: that institutions are systematically more popular than political figures. We just had a huge police reform and, according to the last poll we took – a Gallup poll – the police came out with an 86% confidence rating, a figure which used to be 5%. The same for the Presidency, the same for Parliament, the same for other institutions in the country: it was exactly the inverse of what happened previously. That really tells you that the institutions are more popular than the leaders and that the country is moving in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is a great deal more to do. Obviously, we are more committed than ever to pursuing our paths of reform. We are aware that democracies are always a work in progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, our alternative democratic model was not welcomed by everybody. It met fierce opposition among those revisionist forces who still perceive the fall of the USSR as the worst catastrophe of the 20th century. They imposed a full-scale embargo on my nation in 2006. Before that, there was a full-scale energy embargo in 2005. They deported our citizens, repeatedly bombed our territory prior to 2008 and finally invaded in 2008. As I speak, these forces still occupy 20% of Georgian territory, in blatant violation of international law and of the 12 August ceasefire agreement brokered thanks to the efforts of my good friend and great European leader, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was then President of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I speak, Georgia still has up to 500 000 IDPs and refugees who cannot return home because some people, animated by an old imperialist mentality, decided to welcome the 21st century by organising ethnic cleansing campaigns and building a new Berlin Wall dividing my country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How did we respond to these aggressions? First, we fully implemented the ceasefire agreement and went beyond our obligations, without once using Russia’s refusal to comply as a pretext. Last August, the Head of the European Union Monitoring Mission, Hansjörg Haber – a German – publicly praised Georgian restraint and our engagement strategy as constructive unilateralism. When tanks and missiles are standing 50 km from a capital, it would be high time for many governments to cry that they are besieged, there is no time to have freedom and it is a luxury to have democracy – which they cannot afford – and start to crack down on their opposition and call for so-called unity of society. We did exactly the opposite. We are building, in these circumstances, democracy at gunpoint.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In front of the iron curtain which the occupation forces have built around the region of Abkhazia, in the small seaside town of Anaklia, which was a violent no man’s land just a few years ago, a new tourist resort is being built as we speak, with beautiful hotels and sandy beaches. Some suggest that we should stop and wait until the situation is resolved and only start building when the ground is more solid, less shaky and less dangerous. Our philosophy is the complete opposite. We are constructing buildings not because they are on strong and solid ground but because by building them, we will eventually make the ground stronger.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Anaklia, a new phase of development started in 2005 after it had already been destroyed twice by the conflict, in 1993 and 1998. In 2008, it once again witnessed total destruction. All the new buildings were burnt down by invading Russian troops, including discos, cafés, youth hostels and other hotels. A few weeks later, construction started again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A great poet and a famous Russian dissident, Alexandr Galich, one of those eight heroes who demonstrated on Red Square in 1968 against the invasion of Prague, was the author of this great phrase: Отечество в опасности! Наши танки на чужой земле!, which means that ‘the homeland is in danger, our tanks have invaded a foreign country’. He wrote another splendid line about Georgia, which again I shall quote in Russian: Прекрасная и гордая страна! Ты отвечаешь шуткой на злословье!, which translates roughly as ‘splendid and proud country, you respond to mud-slinging with a smile’.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">The last time I visited Anaklia, I saw a row of discotheques as lively as you can see anywhere in Europe, where young people danced just as they would in Ibiza or St Tropez. The only difference was that the ‘18’ Disco where we went was the last disco on the beach. Exactly five metres from there is a wall beyond which the occupying army is stationed, and then there is almost 100 km of darkness and emptiness. Let me ask you: what is more absurd than a new Berlin Wall on a sandy subtropical Black Sea beach?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In short, we understand that peace is in our supreme interest, and we are convinced that there is no alternative to peace. By jeopardising peace, we would place at risk everything we have achieved and everything we want to achieve in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have come here to announce a new step in our policy of constructive unilateralism. I am here to take an initiative that I hope, with your help, will defuse the tensions and allow serious negotiations to start. Before coming, I reflected a lot. I also consulted with our friends – American and European allies and people in the region – and the Georgian Government already considers itself bound by the 12 August ceasefire agreement and has always understood that the ceasefire clearly prohibits the use of force.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But in order to prove that Georgia is definitely committed to a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the Russian Federation, we are today taking the unilateral initiative of declaring that Georgia will never use force to roll back the Russian occupation and to restore its control over the occupied areas. It will only resort to peaceful means in its quest for de-occupation and reunification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even if the Russian Federation refuses to withdraw its occupation forces, even if its proxy militias multiply their human rights violations, Georgia will only retain the right to self-defence in the case of new attacks and invasion of the 80% of the Georgian territory that remains under the control of the Georgian Government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will address the relevant letters to the Secretary-General of the UN, the Secretary-General of the OSCE and the leadership of the European Union, stating clearly that we commit ourselves not to use force in order to restore control of all our illegally divided country, neither against the occupation forces nor against their proxies – even though the UN Charter might allow us to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My pledge here before you constitutes a unilateral declaration of a state under international law. This initiative is far from easy for a country that is partially occupied and has 500 000 IDPs and refugees. It constitutes and expands our policy of constructive unilateralism. I am ready for deep, comprehensive dialogue with my Russian counterpart.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will, of course, continue to participate in the Geneva talks, hoping that our pledge today will persuade the Russian Federation to stop blocking these discussions. But we need political dialogue to start as well. For this to occur, the international community must make it clear to the Russian leaders that the situation today is totally irregular and unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to push them to discuss a compromise, it is essential clearly to state the reality of the situation on the ground. This is why we are asking that the Russian military build-up within the international borders of Georgia be qualified as illegal occupation of a sovereign territory. Many European nations, as well as the United States, have already done so. Because if this is not a military occupation, then what is it? Is it military tourism when you have tens of thousands of troops, missiles and tanks deployed illegally against you, and a part is removed from your populated territory?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Equally, the brutal campaigns that have expelled hundreds of thousands of Georgian citizens from the occupied territories should be qualified as illegal acts of ethnic cleansing. If we fail to denounce this ethnic cleansing, why would the occupiers ever even consider allowing them to return back to their homes, towns and villages?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, if the first victim of war is always the truth, the truth is always the most solid foundation of peace. Our constructive unilateralism and the pledge I have just made will not have the expected impact if our European friends do not speak out the truth. If you do not speak out the truth, then who will? I came here today humbly to tell you that, basically we – and maybe the whole region – depend on you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, our region has known too many wars in recent history. It is time – to paraphrase Hugo once again – to replace cannons with round tables. Our region has had its own Warsaw, its own Coventry, its own Oradour-sur-Glane, and it is time to build on our common rejection of war and destruction. It is time to say that we must never have another Grozny, a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants that has been totally erased from the surface of the globe. It is time to say that we must never again see people expelled from their homes and deported on the basis of their nationality, faith or origin, as happened in my own country as well as in other countries in the region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am ready to work with the Russian leadership to ensure that this does not happen again and that the consequences of the war are reversed and conditions for peace established. Walls like the one dividing Georgia will not be brought down by bombs but by the commitment of citizens to build a free, united, democratic country and by the commitment of the world community to enforce international law, and this is the ambition we will never give up. We will never give up our ambition to reunite our country and establish it as a free democratic nation by peaceful means.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is noticeable that, despite the enormous pressure and multiple threats from Moscow, not a single former Soviet Republic has recognised this dismemberment of Georgia. It shows – to the great surprise and fury of some people – that the old times are definitely over. It shows that the former captive nations of Soviet times have, with all the hurdles and problems, become strong independent states that determine their own policies. No one, in short, is going back to the USSR.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, our region has made a choice. A war has been launched to stop this movement, but tanks cannot reverse the sense of history, and it is time for the long and dolorous hangover of imperialism to end peacefully. I call, therefore, on the Russian leaders to make the choice of the future. They could play such a major positive role in the ongoing transformation of our common region, accepting other countries as partners and not as vassals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all want – and I personally want – Russia as a partner and not as an enemy. Nobody has a greater interest than us in seeing Russia turn into a country that truly operates within the concert of nations, respects international law, and – this is often connected – upholds basic human rights. This is why I wholeheartedly support the efforts of European and American leaders to engage Russia in a more constructive relationship. Our conflict has done nothing to harden feelings between our two peoples; I want to tell the Russian people that they will always be welcome in Georgia as partners, tourists, students, businessmen, journalists or simply as friends – but not as occupation forces.</p>
      <a text="(Great applause from the floor)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end this speech with a quote from the President of the first Georgia Republic, Noe Zhordania. As you might know, Georgia was the first European social democratic republic ever proclaimed in 1918, and we are very proud of this. We have strong women’s rights and other strong social rights enshrined in the constitution. A few days before the Red Army invaded Georgia, Zhordania explained our European choice: ‘What do we take from the cultural bow of European nations? More than 2 000 years of national culture, a democratic system and natural wealth’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Russia offered us the chance to go back and have military lives. We told Russia that we are going to Europe, and we want Russia to go together with us towards Europe. Today, another Georgian President is addressing you with the same message of love for European ideas and values. It is rare that a nation is given the same opportunity twice in history. I came here today to tell you that we will seize this opportunity and do whatever we can to achieve our European destiny.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to the change in the agenda approved yesterday by this House, I would firstly like to express my approval for the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously approved the draft report that we are voting on today.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact that the construction of the European judicial space finds such a broad consensus in Parliament is important. The Stockholm Programme envisages that everyday life should be intrinsic to the process of constructing a Europe of citizens and not merely of political forces or institutional representations. It sets out to resolve the everyday problems of Europeans by the real and unified creation of an effective market of labour, goods and services, entrepreneurial activity without internal borders and without red tape, to strengthen the common basis of rights of succession, contracts, consumers, timely payments, the family, children and more.</p>
      <p sl="it">It will also be the duty and responsibility of the justice system, national judiciaries, solicitors, accountants and workers who operate within individual States to build Europe, to interpret the laws that unite our continent. Our past is marked by different judicial and legal traditions – Common law and Civil law – with differences between the French or German systems and histories that are sometimes very different. We respect national prerogatives and the principle of subsidiarity, but we realise that in order to build Europe – and fortunately we are still on that road – we need progressive convergence that is based on the great constitutional tradition of fundamental rights for which Europe stands.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, the Action Plan that we will approve sets out to construct, reinforce, extend and disseminate a solid European judicial culture, a European legal mindset. That is why I will vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, would you trust an economic forecaster who had recently said this: ‘The euro has done more to enforce budgetary discipline in the rest of Europe than any number of exhortations from the IMF or the OECD’? Or this: ‘The euro has already provided great internal stability for the eurozone’? Or this: ‘If we get rid of sterling and adopt the euro, we will also get rid of sterling crises and sterling over-valuations. This will give us a real control over our economic environment’.</p>
      <p sl="en">All three of those quotations come from our former colleagues in this House, Nick Clegg and Chris Huhne – now, alarmingly, ministers in the British Government. We, on the other hand, who oppose the euro – there is no way of putting this modestly – have been proved absolutely right. We always said that an ECB rate determined by the needs of the core would be disastrous for the periphery.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not expecting any humility from those who got it so disastrously wrong. I am sure they will still be wheeled out by the BBC as disinterested experts, and I am sure that we will still be portrayed as doctrinaire hardliners. Believe me, I am not gloating for the sake of it. A friend of mine just said that there is nothing more irritating than being wise during the event. But please listen to us next time. The single currency forces nations to adopt the wrong monetary policy, with calamitous outcomes for the bailout receivers and to those paying.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I share the concern my colleague just expressed about this obsession with harmonisation. When we look at the moves towards a common VAT tax base, we hear MEPs across this House arguing for more and more harmonisation when it comes to tax, forgetting that what we really need here at EU level is more tax competition. We also need this at global level to ensure that when it comes to the economy and economic competitiveness, we are not taxing our citizens out of productive capability and productive forces – what we are actually doing is ensuring that we have enough entrepreneurs and innovators in a country, and one of the best ways we can do that is by tax competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">This obsession with harmonisation has led us to a single currency that does not take account of national differences and differences in economic cycles. This is why countries are suffering; this is partly why Ireland is suffering; and it is time we moved more towards competition, rather than to common tax bases.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report examines the annual report and the activity carried out this year. Economic and financial and, to a growing extent, political actions are still extensively dominated by the international financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">Events in Greece and in other countries of the area naturally have complex causes. The problems are largely of internal origin because they stem from a lack of structural reforms.</p>
      <p sl="it">Without a shadow of a doubt, the European monetary union has not operated in the way it was designed to work. The principles of the Stability and Growth Pact have not always been respected and infringements that seemed minor initially have proven, over time, to be a serious threat to the pact as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must therefore learn a lesson from the situation.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we can see the way in which the Irish Republic has been brought to its present predicament by the euro. As early as 2001, Irish economists were alarmingly warning that Ireland desperately needed to raise interest rates to choke off the unsustainable boom. But of course, there were no Irish interest rates; there was only the European Central Bank, which, by giving the core members what they needed, was giving the peripheral members a double dose of what they did not need, namely, artificially cheap money.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problems of Ireland are going to carry on for as long as it is in the single currency. The bailout may allow it to limp on until the next time that its monetary policy needs to diverge from those of the rest of the eurozone. It is crazy, at a time like this, when my own country already owes GBP 850 billion, that we should be borrowing another GBP 7 billion to send to Ireland. That money will not only be useless, it will be actively harmful because it will trap the Republic of Ireland in its present discontents.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we want to be helpful, we could offer our friends and neighbours the far more immediate and practical assistance of allowing them a temporary currency union with sterling, allowing them to treat their loans as being denominated in pounds, and allowing them then to export their way back to growth.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to explain the reason why I voted against Amendments 30 and 31 to Article 5 of the Gallagher report: for the very simple reason that it would separate the Bay of Biscay TAC from the rest of the area. The justification was simply that there are many small local fishing boats in that particular region that do not have a big impact on the stocks of mackerel in the waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">The argument I would make is that every coastal community, virtually in every country, could make the same argument in order to protect the interests of their fishermen. The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee does not seem to suggest that we can separate the fish stocks in the waters. Fish are a transient species, they move around, and this separation is not in accord with the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The plan for the long-term management of the stocks within the North Atlantic should not be fiddled with. If we have a common fisheries policy, it should be common for all, no exceptions, no exemptions, and the long-term consequences of this are quite serious.</p>

      <p sl="es">Changing them could mean changes in the fishing framework, and could even cause disputes with local fisheries, which mainly use horse mackerel to provide quality fish to the public.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In relation to climate change, the Baltic Sea is particularly at risk of the disappearance of certain species of fish, and errors in European fisheries legislation, which imposes bans on fishing, are exacerbating this situation.

      <p sl="en">I welcome this report agreeing to release EU funds to assist the victims of flooding in Ireland. Ireland applied for assistance from the European Solidarity Fund following heavy rain which led to severe flooding in November 2009. The flooding caused damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties, businesses and road networks and infrastructures. After evaluation of the application, the Commission has proposed to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund for a total amount of EUR 13 022 500. It is worth noting that this is the first agreed proposal to mobilise funds in 2010 and the amount proposed will leave at least 98% of the European Solidarity Fund available for allocation in the rest of 2010.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that. This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world. An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers’ rights. The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future. The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, and it is now right to give this assistance to Ireland, which has submitted a request for assistance from the fund following heavy rains that caused flooding in November 2009. The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, homes and businesses, the road network and other infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="de">In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of environmental disasters. In particular, heavy rainfall has frequently caused floods which have devastating consequences for the environment and result in damage that costs huge amounts of money to rectify.</p>

The overall cost of the damage which is a direct result of the disaster is estimated to be around EUR 520 million.

In view of this, and recalling the disaster that struck the island of Madeira in February 2010 and the effects of the Xynthia windstorm on Europe, I welcome the Commission’s proposal to grant a total of EUR 13 022 500 in aid to Ireland, based on the ‘extraordinary regional disaster’ criterion. This criterion is used whenever it is shown that the damage caused has affected the majority of the region’s population and that it has had serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and economic stability in the region in question. However, I would like to reiterate the need to review the current ESF system in order to make it swifter and more effective in mitigating the permanent effects of natural disasters.</p>

As was the case in my home country of Poland, ravaging floods have torn apart so many communities and families that it is vital to lend support to our friends in Ireland. The funds will come from the Solidarity Fund, which is allocated for major catastrophes such as this. The funds will go to those communities that were hit the hardest and lend support to those families and business that were most affected by these floods and assist them with rebuilding and recovering some of the revenue lost because of the devastation of their businesses. It is important that the EU continues to support its Member States in their time of need and truly invokes the idea of solidarity.</p>

I therefore believe that the use of this tool, in specific cases, is entirely justified.

      <p sl="pt">Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation must be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively. In the light of the structural changes in international trade, it is vital that the European economy is able to effectively implement the instruments to support workers affected in this way, and to retrain them with a view to assisting their swift reintegration into the labour market. Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis. It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities that normally belong to the companies, nor is it intended for the funding and restructuring of companies. I am voting in favour of this report, given the request by the Netherlands for assistance in respect of 821 redundancies in 70 enterprises operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland.</p>

      <p sl="pt">821 redundancies in 70 companies in the graphics sector in the Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland regions of the Netherlands show that the global economic and financial crisis does not spare sectors which, at first glance, appear to be more sheltered from its effects. This hints at the worrying reduction in the number of printing and publishing companies in the Netherlands and, consequently, the very downturn in the economy as a whole. The European Commission deemed this request for printing and recorded media reproduction companies justifiable, and was backed overwhelmingly by the relevant parliamentary committee.

Altogether, more than 3 000 workers have been made redundant. Initial estimates as to the number of people who would benefit from the fund at the time of its creation have long been exceeded. Above and beyond the systematic mobilisation of this instrument, what is needed is a clear break with the neoliberal policies that are causing an economic and social disaster within the countries of the European Union before our very eyes. Palliatives are indeed needed for the disaster, but the causes need to be addressed first of all.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The field of printing and reproduction of recorded media, which forms part of the graphics sector, has been particularly eroded in the Netherlands, as shown by the various applications to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). The region of Drenthe, which has the third highest unemployment rate in the country, has not remained immune to this trend. It is worth emphasising the need for this fund to be mobilised quickly and effectively, without excessive red tape, so as to contribute to better training for the workers made redundant, and thus facilitating their reintegration into the labour market in better conditions than those in which they left.</p>

More specifically, this concerns 129 redundancies from nine companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Limburg, a province which is facing a very difficult situation, both because it has the second highest unemployment rate in the Netherlands (8%) and because it has a per capita income that is significantly below the national average.

In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened to include its intervention in situations like this, in which, as a direct result of the global economic and financial crisis, there are ‘at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level’.

Nevertheless, I understand the need to extend the period for phasing the monopoly out, given the economic needs of the German rural economy, particularly in some of the country’s federal states.

The Commission proposal is accompanied by a schedule of reduction in the quantities of alcohol produced under the monopoly until their total abolition on 1 January 2018.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Under Article 182(4) of the Single Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation, and as an exception to the State aid rules, Germany may grant State aid under the German Alcohol Monopoly for products marketed, after further transformation by the monopoly, as ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. The total quantity allowed to be granted as State aid is limited to EUR 110 million per year and mainly goes to farmers supplying the raw material and distilleries using it. However, the actual budget used has been smaller than that amount and has been steadily decreasing since 2003. Moreover, a large number of distilleries have already made efforts to prepare for their entry into the free market by creating cooperatives, investing in more energy-efficient equipment and increasingly marketing their alcohol directly.</p>

Both of them think that the few intervention measures that still remain should be completely phased out, subjecting agriculture to the ‘free market’. Therefore, they limit themselves to stating that ‘more time is needed to facilitate the adaptation process, and to allow distillers to survive on the free market’. In contrast to the rapporteur’s position, we believe that intervention in the markets and regulation instruments should, in fact, be the rule rather than the exception.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is the only way to guarantee a living income for farmers, especially small and medium-sized producers. Therefore, it is the only way to guarantee the future of small and medium-sized agriculture, as well as the right to produce, and each country’s right to food security and food sovereignty. Instead of an exception being made for Germany for a specific product, other countries and other products should be considered for intervention as well.</p>

The final extension of the German alcohol monopoly which was adopted today represents an important step forward. It gives our fruit distilleries, in particular, the security to plan for the future beyond 2010.</p>

This aid does not evidence any breaches of the principles of competition, and it is a form of support for the smallest businesses. Despite the fact that the aid is being given in an appropriate way, I support the proposal for information to be made available about all events related to this support. There must not be breaches of any kind, because this would be unfair to other often much weaker and poorer producers.

However, a sufficient amount of time is required for these measures to be taken.

      <p sl="de">Whether and in what form the German Alcohol Monopoly will be retained and what changes will be made to it are all factors that will have an impact primarily on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The EU constantly claims that it wants to provide more support for SMEs, which are the motor of the economy and the main providers of jobs. In this context, we need legal certainty and, therefore, an extension of the monopoly over a longer period. This is the only way in which small and medium-sized businesses can afford to make the necessary purchases to prepare for the forthcoming deregulation, for example, by establishing cooperatives, modernising their equipment or extending their direct marketing activities. Of course, the issue of the monopoly could have been combined with the phasing out of the common agricultural policy and the new regulations which will apply from 2013.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there were no pressing grounds for doing so. The important thing is to ensure that the adaptation process is designed to allow the distilleries to survive after the monopoly has come to an end. I agree with the rapporteur on this issue.

The importance of these sectors to economic and social development in both the European Union and Ukraine is acknowledged through the cooperation in various areas of common interest: the environment and climate change, health, green energy, the information society, industry and agriculture, etc. Not only access to the research infrastructure but also the exchange of bilateral and multilateral experience between researchers in the EU and Ukraine can help increase the financial efficiency of the projects implemented, thereby reducing the duplication of effort and resources used.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am also convinced that European Union relations with the Solomon Islands, where the sea is full of tuna, also represent a considerable economic interest. In this way, it is possible to support the economic efficiency of the European Union tuna fishery supply chain in the Pacific, guaranteeing access to 4 000 tonnes of fish, a considerable quantity for the industry and the European market and partly offsetting the foreseeable reduction of tuna fishing opportunities in the eastern Atlantic.</p>

      <p sl="da">We four Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have chosen to vote against the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Solomon Islands. Our decision is based on a genuine fear that tuna will be exploited and overfished. Two species in particular – the yellowfin and bigeye tuna – are endangered, and therefore fishing of these species should, as far as possible, be discontinued. This fisheries agreement threatens tuna stocks, as it gives the green light to all catching of fish as long as European fishermen provide financial compensation for each tonne of tuna caught. This will very likely result in uncontrollable overfishing and, in the worst case scenario, it may threaten the survival of tuna in the region.</p>

Through these, the EU fleet has access to fish stocks which, for one reason or another, the partners cannot or do not intend to catch. We are currently aiming to renew the FPA with the Solomon Islands for another three years. As the rapporteur says, ‘the EU is proposing to provide the same financial support to the Solomon Islands under the new agreement as it did under the previous agreement, even though fewer fishing authorisations are to be granted and the allowable catch volume is lower’. This is especially relevant when we consider that, under the previous version of the FPA, four Portuguese longliners were fishing in the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands, which is now no longer possible because no fishing opportunities were negotiated for longliners. It is true, however, that a clause has been included allowing the introduction of new fishing opportunities where necessary.</p>

That is also true of this agreement. We voted for this report, but we still have serious reservations about how the agreement has been implemented up to now, some of which are quite rightly shared by the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am referring, amongst other things, to the fact that the Joint Committee never met while the agreement was in force; the fact that the terms under which responsible fishing practices would be implemented in the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands have not been set out; and the failure to establish how catch volumes will be monitored. These are failures that put the achievement of the agreement’s goals at serious risk, and they must not be repeated when it is renewed.

Therefore, the proposal will have no consequences in terms of tax rates. The Commission proposes that the extension should take effect on 1 January 2011 for a period ending on 31 December 2015. To maintain the degree of harmonisation of rates already achieved, the Commission has twice submitted proposals providing for a standard rate band with a minimum rate of 15% and a maximum rate of 25%. The band was derived from the rates applied in practice in the Member States, where the standard rates had always varied between 15% and 25%. In both cases, the proposals to approximate rates were amended by the Council which kept only the principle of the minimum rate. I agree with the Commission that the purpose of the extension is not only to give businesses the necessary legal certainty, but also to allow further evaluation of the appropriate level of the standard VAT rate at EU level. I believe that in the future Green Paper on the review of the VAT system, the Commission should not only examine the specific issue of the standard VAT rate and other rates, but also the broader issue of a new VAT strategy, including the scope of VAT and the derogations.</p>

It will fix the minimum standard rate at 15% up to the end of 2015. While the European Commission repeatedly proposed introducing a maximum rate of 25%, the European Council did not support this. At the same time, the standard rate does not currently exceed 25% in any Member State. Estonia, where the standard rate of VAT is 20%, is among the 19 Member States where the rate is 20% or more. Regarding this aspect, I wish to point out that I strongly supported the extension of the 15% minimum rate, which will give every Member State the option to decide how high its rate should be. In addition, this report ensures legal certainty for our entrepreneurs, who will know that for the next five years, European legislation will prevent the standard rate of VAT from rising.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Commission’s proposal provides for a five-year extension of the current requirement for EU Member States to have a minimum standard value added tax (VAT) rate of 15% until 15 December 2015. The idea is to maintain the harmonised fiscal structure, with two obligatory rates of VAT and harmonisation within a 10% band: in other words, between 15% and 25%. The Member States undertake to avoid extending the current span above the current lowest standard rate applied by them. I agree with the rapporteur that, with its increasing complexity, the current VAT system is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market. I also hope that in the future, the European Commission will analyse not just this issue of the standard rate of VAT but also the general subject of revising the current system, including its scope and derogations, and that it will commit to drawing up a new strategy for this tax. I voted for the report for the reasons given above.</p>

Since as early as 1993, the European Union has been operating a transitional system for VAT. Attempts to move to what is known as a definitive system have so far failed. However, this is no reason why we should not keep on trying.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The VAT system is not just a question of rates and ranges, but also one of a simple, legally certain scheme which works well in the internal market, which is tailored to SMEs and is resistant to fraud. The fact that the Commission plans to pick up this thread is good news. I would like to encourage the competent Commissioner to tackle this difficult dossier.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I believe that in the new VAT strategy, particular attention should be paid to the reform of VAT rules, in keeping with principles that actively promote attainment of the objectives of the internal market. As the rapporteur points out, the current VAT system, with its increased complexity, not just in terms of rates, is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market. In January 2009, the VAT rate in Lithuania increased from 18-19%, and to 21% in September. It is important that future changes do not dent foreign investor interest in Lithuania. We must propose favourable tax planning opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="lt">According to the new VAT strategy, we should aim to reduce the administrative burden, remove tax obstacles and improve the business environment, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Prior to adopting a final decision, the Commission should fully consult public and private sectors. VAT rates should be discussed during these consultations, as well as broader issues, such as the goal of setting a maximum rate and VAT structure and operational framework alternatives. Therefore, I look forward to the Commission’s Green Paper on the review of the VAT system.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of the European Central Bank (ECB) annual report because I think that measures to maintain a low inflation rate, close to 2%, while increasing liquidity in the markets, prevented the collapse of many financial institutions. However, I recognise that the full recovery potential of the ECB’s measures did not unfold because their liquidity was not always passed on to the real economy. It should be recalled that the crisis started out as a financial one, becoming an economic one, too, later on.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The governments of the Member States and the ECB have had to respond to the most serious crisis since the 1930s. We have witnessed a contraction of gross domestic product, a drop in economic activity and an increase in budget deficits, resulting in reduced tax receipts and creating unsustainable public debt: it has been difficult to achieve figures comparable with those existing before the crisis. This situation is a result of the lack of structural reforms within the EU, which is so obvious in the events in Greece and other countries of the euro area. I therefore think that it is important to deal with the weaknesses in the financial system at global level and learn all the lessons from the crisis by improving the quality of risk management and the transparency of the financial markets.</p>

It basically repeats the anti-grassroots decisions of the EU summit in October to create a controlled bankruptcy mechanism, to introduce stricter terms in the Stability Pact and apply it to the letter and to impose penalties on Member States which fail to comply with those terms. It welcomes the money package made available at EU and Member State level for the stock exchange and other sectors of capital, in order to ensure that it remains profitable during the capitalist crisis. It supports all the barbaric measures against the working and grassroots classes applied by the bourgeois governments in all the Member States of the EU. In order to get the EU out of the capitalist economic crisis, the political representatives of capital propose that the rate of capitalist restructurings in all the Member States be stepped up, so as to maintain the profitability of the monopoly groups, at the expense of the workers, who are being called upon to pay for the crisis. Ireland is the most recent and will not, of course, be the last example of the tragic consequences in store for the workers as a result of encouraging the sovereignty of the monopolies and their profitability.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the resolution on the European Central Bank report on the basis of the excellent report by my German colleague, Mr Balz. Having become a European institution with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the ECB, whilst being independent, cannot be indifferent to the wishes of the European people, represented by their parliaments, or of the Member States’ governments. I therefore support the request for the ECB’s work and decision making to be transparent. During the crisis, the ECB adjusted interest rates down to 1% and continued unprecedented non-standard measures to support credit throughout 2009. Those measures have borne fruit. I support the idea that lifting these measures needs to be well timed and coordinated with national governments. In particular, it would be helpful if the ECB were to carry out a global, rather than regional, assessment of inflation in its monetary policy for setting intervention rates to exit the crisis.</p>

I supported this resolution and believe that a monetary union needs strong coordination of economic policies and for the current gap in macro-prudential supervision to be closed by establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). I feel that under the concept whereby the ESRB only gives warnings and recommendations with no actual enforcement, it is impossible to satisfy the principles of effective implementation and responsibility, and the ESRB cannot declare an emergency by itself. Therefore, the ESRB must be given greater powers. It is particularly important to call on the European Commission not to simply limit itself to amending the regulation on credit rating agencies, which would increase the liability of these agencies, but to present a proposal on the establishment of a European Credit Rating Agency which would facilitate an objective assessment of the economic and financial position of the Member States.</p>

I also agree with the call for the unrestricted and more coherent application of the Stability and Growth Pact, as I believe that the pact should be complemented by the development of an early warning system to detect possible inconsistencies, such as in the form of a ‘European semester’, in order not only to enhance surveillance and economic policy coordination so as to ensure fiscal consolidation, but – beyond the budgetary dimension – to address other macro-economic imbalances and strengthen enforcement procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The monetary union needs strong and enhanced coordination of economic policies to be robust.

      <p sl="it">However, the very existence of unexpected variations in the key macro-economic indicators should make us stop and think about the intermediate mechanisms at work between monetary policy and the real economy. I therefore think it necessary not only to set up other supervisory and control authorities to support the ECB, but also and, above all, to cover those spheres of responsibility which, hitherto, have not been seen as important.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, Estonia’s forthcoming accession to the euro area is a source of concern. An enlarged monetary union requires, in fact, greater internal cohesion. The macro-economic performance of that Baltic state aside, in accordance with the standards required by the EU, greater convergence must be achieved among the euro area countries, not least to increase the capacity for action on the part of the institutions, which safeguard its stability and value.</p>

The ECB therefore adjusted interest rates down to 1% and continued the non-standard measures introduced in 2008 throughout 2009. The five key elements of the enhanced credit support were fixed rate full allotment, an expansion of the list of collateral, longer maturities for refinancing operations, liquidity provisions in foreign currencies and financial market support through a measured but significant covered bond purchase programme. Close coordination is required with national governments in EU countries in connection with their own programmes, especially in the light of the crises which have hit Greece and, now Ireland, and of the gloomy prospect of them spreading.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Central Bank (ECB) the status of an EU institution, which increases the responsibility of Parliament as an EU institution through which the ECB is accountable to the European public. The ECB annual report 2009 deals primarily with the ECB’s reaction to the crisis, the exit strategy and governance topics. The financial crisis which started about two years ago with the US sub-prime mortgage crisis rapidly spread to the EU and turned into an economic crisis as well, hitting the real economy. Real GDP in the euro area shrank by 4.1% in 2009, the average general government deficit ratio increased to about 6.3% and the public debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 69.4% in 2008 to 78.7% in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The ECB acted correctly by adjusting interest rates down to 1% and continuing with substantial and unprecedented non-standard measures to support credit.

The latest developments in the Irish crisis have reassured the banks that they will be able to carry on handsomely rewarding their shareholders and taking risks in the long term, since the Member States and the European taxpayers will always be there to save them. Privatisation of profits and public ownership of large-scale losses … Heads I win, tails you lose … It is paradoxical, and indeed scandalous, that the turmoil in the stock market caused by Ireland’s sovereign debt is the direct consequence of the aid that the country granted to its banks – aid that has made its deficit worse than ever before and sent its debt soaring. Moreover, the banks that it saved, or their sister banks, are the ones that are today speculating against it. However, the main lesson to be learnt from all this is that the euro is a millstone round its Member States’ neck and that the European Central Bank’s policy, like the euro exchange rate, is geared solely towards Germany. The Member States that have fared best are those that have retained some flexibility with regard to their currency and their exchange rates. Their national currency, that is!

Our most important proposal for improvement should be put into practice consistently. In other words, the ECB should make its activities more transparent in order to further increase its legitimacy. The new Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, made the ECB into a European Union body.

The distinction between the strategic and operational dimensions is still vague at present. I therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal for the creation of a permanent headquarters responsible for operational planning and conducting military operations. With regard to the development of civilian-military capabilities, the Member States should set objectives that match their resources in terms of personnel deployment. It would also be a good idea to establish real financial solidarity between the Member States. Lastly, greater synergy between civilian and military research would be a big advantage, since it would help prevent repetition, duplication and, hence, unnecessary costs.</p>

      <p sl="it">In particular, without seeking to interfere in every dispute that may arise, the EU, as a major economic and political power, should make its presence felt in cases involving interests of any kind or nature, if necessary, also by using military means to restore order and re-establish peaceful conditions, as a precondition for resolving conflicts.

Given that the UN Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, close cooperation must be established between the EU and the UN in the area of civilian and military crisis management and, in particular, in humanitarian relief operations where the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) is in the lead role.

The establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) should contribute further to the development of a truly comprehensive European approach to civilian and military crisis management, conflict prevention and peacebuilding, and provide the EU with adequate structures, staffing levels and financial resources to meet its global responsibilities.

The changing nature of conflict calls for more extensive cooperation between civilian and military capabilities. The highly successful EU-led Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM) from 2005 to 2006 serves as an important example and reminder of how civilian-military synergies can anchor peace and build confidence in an unstable environment in a timely and effective way. While the decommissioning team, dominated by military experts, monitored the rapid and successful disarmament process, the civilian team of AMM worked to turn the process into a platform for further political dialogue and for both parties to credibly commit themselves to permanent peace. The application of civilian and military expertise should not be restricted by the technical labelling of the nature of operations, but should instead be decided on the basis of appropriateness and cost-efficiency.

Military capabilities will be developed at an EU level among those Member States which want this by means of a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PSC). Mr Ehler’s report calls for the conditions for military cooperation to be laid down and for a clear definition of the PSC. For me as an Austrian, clear definitions are of great interest, in particular, with regard to the implementation of the solidarity clause as outlined in Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the mutual assistance clause as outlined in Article 42(7) of the Treaty on the European Union, which are also called for in the report.

The result of this closure – which has had the inevitable tragic economic and social consequences, which it is always necessary in this and other cases to guard against and alleviate as much as possible – is that anchovy stocks have been recovering, making it possible to start exploiting them again. We believe that decisions about closing fisheries, reopening them and setting the conditions for the exploitation of their resources must always be based, first and foremost, on scientific knowledge and advice about the state of the resources.

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report in view of the fact that the results of the IMPASSE project have revealed that ‘the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably, possibly to an acceptable level, if the potential for escape of target and non-target organisms is addressed during transportation and by well-defined protocols at the receiving facility’. It therefore makes complete sense to dispense with the permit requirement for introducing alien species into closed aquaculture facilities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Reducing this administrative burden and the cost of permit applications is an important incentive for the aquaculture sector.

      <p sl="en">The Commission’s proposal deals with amendments to a regulation on the use of alien species in aquaculture based on the IMPASSE project, which focused on the environmental impact of alien species. This project has produced an operational definition of a closed aquaculture facility, which tightens up and enlarges upon the definition currently in use and embodies an approach whereby the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably. In the light of the above results, the Commission is proposing that introductions and translocations involving the use of closed aquaculture facilities be exempted from the permit requirement, thus dispensing operators from that administrative formality. As the rapporteur notes, the introduction of alien species is one of the main reasons why ecosystems are being thrown out of kilter and, along with the destruction of natural habitats, one of the biggest contributory factors implicated in global biodiversity loss. Many of these introductions into Europe’s coastal seas and inland waters are due to ‘aquaculture and stocking practices’. With this in mind, the rapporteur tabled an amendment to specify that ‘closed aquaculture facilities’ were limited to those on land, in order to reduce the possible survival of escapees. Other amendments concerned the comitology provisions.</p>

The IMPASSE project is concerted action on the environmental impact of alien species in aquaculture, which has demonstrated the need to prevent the escape of these species and of biological material during transportation. I welcome this European Parliament report because it is committed to biosecurity and, at the same time, to speeding up the administrative formalities relating to the permit requirement for introductions and translocations for closed aquaculture facilities. Clearly and rigorously defining ‘closed aquaculture facility’, as well as the regularly updated listing of all such facilities by Member States, will lead to the sustainable development of this sector. The Member States must supervise the facilities themselves and the means by which species are transported. I also support the commitment to scientific research and technological development as a means of reducing this sector’s harmful effects on natural ecosystems. Finally, I would highlight the fact that this regulation was amended using the ordinary legislative procedure of codecision, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

When uncompetitive mines are closed, it is important to guarantee that the necessary long-term funding is allocated to ensure environmental protection and rehabilitate former mining sites. In some regions, mines are the only form of industry and their closure will mean that many people will be made redundant. It is therefore essential to ensure that they are provided with assistance on a multiannual basis and various labour market measures, such as retraining, implemented to create the conditions for them to return to the labour market.

      <p sl="fr">Having been consulted by the Commission, the European Parliament was called on to give its verdict, this Tuesday 23 November, on the issue of State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines. The main stumbling block was the cut-off date for that State aid. The Commission proposed 1 October 2014. For environmental reasons, I believe it is important to diversify our sources of energy production and to promote sustainable production methods. 2014 would therefore seem to be a reasonable cut-off date. However, given the social impact of mine closures and the difficulties involved in redeploying miners, support must be provided during the closure process. The majority of the European Parliament has therefore decided to extend the provision of State aid until 31 December 2018.

The disruption caused in financial terms to the entire economy shows that the industrial sector requires a huge amount of support, since it is still a sector of fundamental importance for the economy, especially the real economy. When taking into account the competitive and comparative advantages and disadvantages between regions, especially at international level, we must not forget that the mining industry is present in areas in which the development of sound economic and occupational alternatives should be encouraged as a preliminary step and in which welfare support provisions should be enhanced to prevent painful increases in unemployed workers whom it is difficult to redeploy.

Overall, we think that the Commission’s proposal on this matter is balanced and takes good account of both of these aspects.

As coal mines are concentrated in certain regions (in Germany, Spain and Romania), the social impact of simultaneous mine closures could be significant. In employment terms, the jobs of around 100 000 miners could be at stake; they may be unable to find jobs in other sectors as quickly as is necessary and they run the risk of becoming long-term unemployed. For this very reason, this proposal aims to provide the Member States with a legal framework enabling them to more effectively resolve the potential negative effects of mine closures that could occur as a result of the gradual withdrawal of subsidies, in particular, the social and environmental effects.

It is therefore likely that some Member States will be forced to close their coal mines and cope with the social and regional consequences of that decision. I understand that due to the regional concentration of coal mines, the social impact of simultaneous closure could be significant. Taking into account jobs in mining-related industries, this could jeopardise up to 100 000 jobs.

The example of Germany shows how a coal pact between central government, the federal states, unions and management can result in efficient coal production without the need for redundancies. There is now more security for 100 000 jobs throughout Europe. To avoid any misunderstandings, it is important to realise that these are not permanent subsidies and that the aim is not to prop up uncompetitive businesses. This is all about taking a responsible approach to a traditional European industry. The use of coal can easily be justified, either as a fuel for generating electricity or as a raw material in the chemical industry, particularly in times when resources such as oil and gas are in increasingly short supply.

      <p sl="ro">Based on the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal for a regulation, the deadline for subsidising coal production is being extended to 31 December 2018 (four years longer than in the Commission’s proposal) and is intended only for hard coal. The coal sector provides approximately 100 000 jobs. Mines whose operation is dependent on aid are located particularly in the Ruhr region of Germany, north-west Spain and in Valea Jiului in Romania. Roughly 40% of Romania’s electricity production is based on coal, most of which is hard coal. The deadline of 2014 (proposed by the Commission) for the mine closure plan is arbitrary and is not justified based on the impact assessment carried out by the EU executive itself. Consequently, 2018 guarantees an acceptable solution, taking into account this impact assessment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The rapporteur favours a gradual reduction in aid. The annual reduction must not be less than 10% of the aid granted in the first year and based only on a very closely monitored closure plan. I voted for this report as the application of the regulation in the form proposed by the European Parliament will mitigate the adverse social repercussions of such mine closures, with the mines in Valea Jiului also among those affected by this measure.</p>

The response to the crisis is through investment and protecting the public, which in this case means ensuring conditions that allow the closure of these mines over a period of time after the expected resolution of the crisis, thereby protecting jobs and combating unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="es">My vote reflects my conviction that the closure of these mines should be postponed in order to give the regions and Member States concerned – mainly Spain, Germany and Romania – the time they need to carry out the required restructuring in the current period of crisis.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Should the European Union continue to subsidise industrial sectors that are destined eventually to disappear from Europe? That is the difficult question we had to answer with the adoption of the Rapkay report on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines. The European Commission has proposed a scheduled end of subsidies in October 2014. This is a sensible proposal that takes into account the negative environmental impact of aid for the coal industry and of the need for the Member States to provide a plan of appropriate measures, for example, in the field of energy efficiency, renewable energy or carbon capture and storage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The facts are damning: EUR 1 288 million of aid to production, making a total of EUR 2.9 billion of subsidies for the coal industry between 2003 and 2008, has done nothing to limit the loss of market share, nor has it ensured that the industry’s 100 000 workers receive useful support to help them retrain. I therefore regret that the European Union has not had the courage this lunchtime to say ‘no’ to extending aid for coal mines until the end of 2018 or to turn resolutely towards new energy sources, which would provide jobs for the European population.</p>

Prolonging operational aid to coal mines fails to address the legitimate concerns of coal workers for their futures. Instead, it risks delaying the transition towards a green economy – with a future energy sector based on energy efficiency and renewable energy – which will ensure the creation of thousands of new, sustainable jobs in former coal producing regions.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Although the coal mining industry does not have a great bearing on the Lithuanian economy, this report is important for my country. With the expiry of Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002, some Member States will be forced to close their coal mines immediately and face huge social and regional consequences related to the closures. Lithuania knows only too well the kind of problems that have to be faced following such closures. The closure of Lithuania’s Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant led to the loss of business and jobs. It also dealt a blow to our independence in the field of energy, and so we must not forget that the European Union is founded on energy solidarity. At present, Lithuania and the Baltic countries are energy islands, separated from Europe’s gas and the electricity networks. I was delighted to hear reports this month that the European Commission supports the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Coal mining in Europe is not efficient, and has to be subsidised. However, so-called alternative energy sources are equally – if not more – inefficient. Power plants burning coal therefore have one thing in common with solar or wind-powered plants. The power they produce is simply too expensive. States therefore subsidise coal mining, or purchase the electricity produced at a higher price than the price paid by the end user. Every method of producing electricity has its pluses and minuses. However, experience has taught us that it is not good to rely on one source of energy. If the energy security of Europe is a priority for us, then it would be a mistake to abandon one of the possible energy sources. The state should not use taxpayers’ money to support non-functioning enterprises. Not all mines that are currently unable to survive on the market without subsidies are inevitably doomed to fail. Some of them may become competitive if they are given time to transform. The report of Mr Rapkay wants to make this possible for them. I come from the Prievidza region, which has a strong mining tradition. I know how many families would fall into poverty if the fathers lost a job in the mines. On their behalf, too, I have voted in favour of the report, which creates an opportunity to save thousands of jobs in a traditional Slovak mining region.</p>

Such divorces are sometimes marred by endless red tape and a lack of clear responses from national systems. In many cases, the children and the weakest spouse suffer most from the emotional stresses and strains arising from legal action. Where possible, the best solution would be to set up a system of mediation, namely an amicable agreement between the parties. It would be appropriate to refer for this purpose to the concepts defined in Directive 2008/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters and the European code of conduct for mediators.</p>

This was extremely important for ruling out possible erroneous interpretations of item 40, which states that Parliament ‘strongly supports plans to enable the mutual recognition of the effects of civil status documents’. The expression could suggest, for example, a European Union-wide obligation to recognise a union between people of the same sex registered in a Member State where such a union is permitted.</p>
      <p sl="it">In actual fact, we must distinguish between the effects of a completed legal action (in the case of marriage) and the effects of an official registration document. The latter bears full witness to what is documented (for example, that a homosexual marriage has been entered into in Holland) and this public witness is the effect of the official marital status document. However, the effects of the official registration document are something different and their recognition (for example, a survivor’s pension) is not permitted in a State that does not recognise them. Matters of family law are, in any case, part of the identity of individual states and cannot be touched by EU law. The possibility of a different interpretation led me to choose to abstain.</p>

A greater focus that contributes not only to a more comprehensive perspective on citizenship, including respect for human beings and human dignity, but also to a perspective on the law and on justice that makes it accessible throughout the Union, so that individuals can exert their rights without any internal borders. A focus on individuals that must be guaranteed across the board, including as regards the growing phenomenon of immigration and asylum, albeit in strict compliance with the rules on civil harmony, including security. The Commission Action Plan is a consistent embodiment of the Stockholm Programme. When developing European areas of freedom, security and justice, however, respect must always be shown for the principle of subsidiarity, which encourages respect for individuals and for the traditions that form an integral part of their history.

The real aim is to impose same-sex marriage and adoption by homosexual couples on those Member States that do not recognise them in their own law. Family law is strictly and exclusively the responsibility of the Member States, and it must remain so.

For me, the crux of the matter is paragraph 40, which, in the form that it was adopted today, together with other components of the Stockholm Programme, will provoke conflicts of jurisdiction. In specific terms, there are doubts as to whether we should use family law for the mutual recognition of civil status documents, in other words, marriage certificates, and, therefore, whether we should take into account the decision-making authority of the Member States with regard to the definition of marriage, following the procedure outlined in Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

On the one hand, there is the objective need to unify legislation (for example, in the area of the right to freedom of movement), and, on the other, there is the danger of abuse through differing interpretations of the unified legal norms. The initiative of the Stockholm Programme aimed at securing recognition of official documents by Member States can be welcomed. However, this mechanism must not come into direct conflict with the basic regulations of Member States, particularly in the area of family law. In view of the fact that family law reflects a tradition going back many years and a hard-won social consensus, it is not acceptable for Member State sovereignty in this area to be breached, albeit by well-intentioned unification schemes. Further development should be aimed at ensuring that the unified law does not lead to reduced standards in terms of the rights (civil, social, etc.) that exist in Member States at various levels. It is also necessary to ensure that the unification of regulations does not lead to the possibility of launching property claims and violating state integrity, and there must be a clear definition as to how and by whom the enforceability of unified European regulations will be ensured.</p>

Ever since the EU gained powers in the field of justice and internal affairs, and since the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, for which the EU and the Member States are currently jointly competent, significant progress has been made in the field of civil law. The European Commission communication entitled ‘An area of freedom, security and justice serving the citizen’ (COM(2009)0262) proposed an ambitious plan for development of the aforesaid area in the period 2010-2014.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There can be no doubt that further progress in this area will necessitate a more strategic approach, targeted primarily at the needs of citizens and businesses with regard to exercising rights and freedoms in the single market. Progressive harmonisation, approximation and standardisation are required, for example, in the field of consumer protection. It goes without saying that the radically different legal systems and traditions must be respected and reconciled when ensuring the functionality of measures that have already been introduced. However, I believe that their coexistence should be regarded as a strength and inspiration when creating common solutions for European legislation, rather than a hindrance. In order to meet the challenges, the Commission should conduct an open debate with various representatives of the judicial system, including, in particular, legal professionals.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Stockholm Programme adopted in December 2009 establishes the priorities for the development of a European area of freedom, security and justice over the next five years. In this context, it is important to point out the significant results that have already been achieved, and to hope that the recommended measures can help to respond to the real needs of the public and businesses, facilitating their mobility and the exercise of their rights and freedoms in the single market, without jeopardising the requirements of the principle of subsidiarity and respect for diversity of the legal approaches and constitutional traditions of the different Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today, we voted in plenary on a proposal for a resolution on positive law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, in other words, European Union priorities for the development of an area of freedom, security and justice in the period 2010-2014 with particular regard to aspects of civil, commercial and private international law.</p>
      <p sl="it">The dossier calls on the Commission to improve the proposal submitted in an attempt to overcome certain problems and critical areas that occur specifically in international judicial practice. Assisting national judges on technical aspects of the proposed measures during legislative drafting and the establishment of an independent European claims instrument, which would, amongst other things, make it possible to resolve, at least partly, problems raised by differences of opinion in national procedural law, are specific examples of the constructive and approving approach that a common and extensively discussed proposal for a resolution could have on European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">In an area as important to citizens as civil law, it is necessary to respect and accommodate radically different legal approaches and constitutional traditions but it is also necessary to face up to the negative legal consequences for citizens arising out of this difference.</p>

      <p sl="it">From this perspective, we strongly support the approach of the whole Action Plan, which hinges on the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, to be achieved by strengthening mutual trust.

      <p sl="it">The actions identified in the plan are very important for improving the guarantees of European citizens in respect of the law, but it is necessary to adopt a more strategic and less fragmentary approach based on the real needs of citizens and enterprises in the exercising of their rights. While, on the one hand, we must consider the difficulties of legislating in a harmonised manner within an area of shared responsibility, on the other, we need to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. In this way, the parameters of legal certainty will be increasingly clear and supported and we will pave the way for a genuinely common legal theory and practice with a European Union.</p>

The programme offers advantages and greater transparency to citizens. It also improves the consistency of our system of legal regulations in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, in order to build systems which are more uniform, it is essential that there be greater coordination of what we do and that experience be exchanged between the countries of the Union. This concerns, to a large degree, the justice system, including the extremely important questions of migration and the fight against organised crime. A very important matter, particularly during the current economic problems, will be development of effective mechanisms of action in the area of strengthening the single market and economic integration, by which I mean more liberal principles of commercial exchange between the countries of the European Union and the establishment of legislation on commercial exchange between third countries. From the point of view of the participants of economic processes, it is necessary, above all, to specify businesses’ and consumers’ rights of protection and to continue to monitor effectively the implementation and enforcement of legal regulations in the area of the single market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Since the European Union acquired shared competence over justice and home affairs, huge progress has been made in the area of civil justice. Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes the importance of respecting the different legal systems and traditions within the EU and Mr Berlinguer’s report highlights this as one of the strengths of the EU. Subsidiarity is one of the basic principles of EU law and is based on the condition that the subordinate member is able to resolve problems and carry out tasks independently. The areas of justice and home affairs have traditionally been the responsibility of the Member States. Each Member State has its own special features and traditions which reflect the cultural diversity of Europe. However, in order to keep pace with the changing reality in today’s world, joint responsibility with the European Union is needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nowadays, treaties with cross-border implications are the rule and partnerships or families where the partners come from different Member States are commonplace. However, these involve challenges for national civil legislation which we will have to overcome. As the rapporteur recommends, it is now time to develop a European judicial culture alongside the national judicial cultures.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is a pity that this Parliament has decided simply to withdraw the debate on the Stockholm Programme from the agenda. Where there is no opportunity to debate, there is no opportunity to put questions. Also, if we do not allow a critical exchange of views on the integration process, it will only reinforce the concerns of many Member State citizens. One of these concerns is the talk about creating a civil-law statute of marriage. Many family associations in all Member States are pointing out that the mechanism of the Stockholm Programme may therefore be taken advantage of by same-sex couples. This question can be resolved not only within the framework of civil law procedures and private international law, but also through the complex procedure of family law under Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. If the Stockholm Programme is misused for this purpose, it would amount to an indirect change in legislation, which is precisely what the Union has long been fighting against. The Commission and the Council must therefore explain that neither the socio-legal mechanisms nor the Stockholm Protocol will ever lead to the creation of a statute of marriage for same-sex couples. If we want to build a strong Union, it must not be at the cost of restricting Member State powers or the common good. The ECR Group has submitted proposals for amendment which emphasise the powers of the Member States. Unless these proposals are adopted, I will vote against the submitted report.</p>

    <intervention id="2-404" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the 2011 budget [2010/2972(RSP) ].</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to begin our discussion. Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet, Mr Chastel, during the conciliation meetings, the European Parliament and the Council did not manage to reach agreement on the 2011 budget. We regret this. Agreement could have been reached.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Parliament is aware of the need to make savings. We were prepared to agree to limiting the growth of payment appropriations in the 2011 budget to 2.91% compared to 2010. In return, we wanted to establish a method of bringing the Treaty of Lisbon into force, and specifically we wanted to establish which procedures should be followed in further budget negotiations. This is important, because the Treaty of Lisbon is in force. We did not want to go beyond the treaty in any way. We know that the majority of Member States wanted this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Now we have to decide as quickly as possible how to solve the problem that we have no budget. This is the responsibility of all three European institutions. We have said that a fast track is possible for Parliament, but only if our expectations concerning procedures for the next budget negotiations are guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the last few days, we have witnessed considerable progress in terms of talks with the Council. I am sure that an agreement is within reach. The European Parliament is ready to do a very great deal in order to reach this agreement as quickly as possible. We ended the negotiations on 15 November shortly before midnight with the expectation from Parliament that we want to find good solutions to two fundamental matters: flexibility mechanisms, in order to ensure financing of policies resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon, and also solutions related to the participation of Parliament in the process of negotiating successive multiannual financial frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We also have such expectations regarding the proposals related to own resources for the European Union. We think the European Commission could adopt a decisive role in this matter. I am certain that thanks to a mutual readiness to talk, we will reach agreement. I would like to emphasise once again that I think the role of the European Commission is crucial. Therefore, it is with interest that we await Mr Barroso’s speech, in which he will present both the proposed new budget, which is to be put to the vote on 1 December, and a response to Parliament’s main expectations. Of course, what is to be said by the Presidency – by Mr Wathelet – will also be of particular importance to us, as will what Mr Chastel has to say, too.</p>

    <intervention id="2-405" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the budget comes at a time when our fellow citizens are having doubts because of the weakness of their currency and when Europe is rightly rallying in support of the Irish economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Contrary to what may have been said about the European Parliament’s objectives in these negotiations, this is not about power struggles or institutional disputes, nor is it about ignoring the difficulties faced by our Member States or the public debt crisis from which we are all suffering. No, it is about ensuring that Europe can honour its commitments. Commitments in the social sphere, and here I am thinking of education and lifelong learning; commitments to the victims of natural disasters, and here I am thinking of assistance for countries affected by food riots; and commitments to programmes that create jobs and growth, such as Galileo and ITER.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The reality is that, by looking at things from an accounting point of view rather than from a political point of view, the few Member States that continue to block the negotiations are harming the interests of the 500 million Europeans. By making the European Parliament out to be the villain of the piece, and by suggesting that it wants to spend at a time when the Member States are tightening their belts, that it wants to exercise the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon to the detriment of saving and of Europeans, they are diverting attention from the reality of the problems that exist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is that reality? It is that the latest economic forecasts offer no hope of a return, by 2020, to the strong, sustainable and inclusive growth that the European Union set itself as an objective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also a fact that the current draft budget makes no provision for the financing of the new powers conferred on the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon and fails to fulfil our requests to proceed with the mid-term review of the financial cycle laid down in the 2007-2013 agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, it is a fact that the draft budget makes no – and I mean no – financial provision for the 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In short, the Council is adopting programmes without making any financial provision for them. Moreover, when the President of the European Parliament reminds it of its obligations, it takes offence, but when a local, regional or national authority approves projects without financing them, that authority is condemned. Why, I ask you, would something that is unacceptable at local or national level be acceptable at European level?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is this a way of reconciling our citizens with Europe? I do not think so. I say clearly to the Commission and, above all, to the Council: do not count on my group, do not count on this House voting for programmes that do not have guaranteed funding. My group wants a return to common sense and a balanced agreement to be reached. It must be a comprehensive agreement that relates, at the same time, to the 2011 budget, the 2010 amending budget and its associated letters of amendment, the flexibility procedure and, finally, the guarantees regarding the financing of future policies, which we call the political section.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would stress that our proposals on this political section do not involve any changes to the current treaties, nor do they anticipate in any way the amount, origin or distribution of future EU funds. I would also stress that reopening the debate on own resources is not a new proposal by Parliament, but a decision taken by the Council itself in May 2006, following the agreement reached in December 2005 under the UK Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group fully supports the objective not only of capping but also of reducing the Member States’ budget contributions. Indeed, the extremely serious nature of the debt crisis must lead to a complete overhaul of European public finances. This is not just about dividing up tasks between national budgets and European budgets; it is also about seeking out all possible forms of mutualisation in order to make savings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the two demands made by the Council on 15 October: for the EU budget to contribute to common financial discipline and for the funding of European objectives to be guaranteed. That is all we are aiming for in the negotiations on the 2011 budget, and we are confident that an agreement can be reached if the Council Presidency negotiates effectively with its colleagues in Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think that the crisis in which we currently find ourselves was triggered by events in Deauville. I believe that the President of France and the Chancellor of Germany made a deal with David Cameron in Deauville which involved his agreement to the revision of the treaty for the Stability and Growth Pact in return for the United Kingdom’s budget demands being met. I may be wrong, but the suspicion is there. This would be a deal made at the expense of third parties, in other words, at the expense of the rights of the European Parliament. Therefore, it should be no surprise that the third party, in this case this House, is not prepared to go along with this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, it should also be no surprise that the fate of Europe is being left in the hands of eurosceptic governments. In this sort of situation, a government of this kind will test out how far it can go. The British Government is currently testing out whether the rest of Europe will accept its prerogatives or not. Therefore, this budget or budget debate is also a debate about the direction in which the European Union should develop. It is not about money. We have agreed on the money. I believe that this is an important message for the voters and the citizens of Europe. We have come to an agreement on the money and, as a Parliament, we have met the demands of the United Kingdom with regard to the money: a 2.91% increase in spending, not the commitment appropriations, but the expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="de">If not money, then what is it all about? It is about the rights of the European Parliament. It is about the rights which are laid down in the treaty. Everything that Parliament is calling for forms part of the treaty. The subject of own resources is covered in Article 311 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Medium-term financial planning is a procedure established in the treaty, for which a regulation must be enacted. Flexibility in the budget involves the mutual interest of governments, the Commission and Parliament and their ability, within the framework of budgetary rules, to respond flexibly to short-term requirements. It is not about additional spending; it is about how efficiently Europe is governed, at least that is the case with flexibility, and it is about the primary rights of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am rather surprised. The Heads of Government of the European Union are all parliamentarians. They are all men and women who have grown up in the parliamentary tradition. As Mr Daul has already said, which national parliament would allow its central right, the right to draw up a budget, to be interfered with by the will of the executive? The 27 governments of the European Union are executives. However, we must not allow democracy in Europe to be turned upside down. Parliament enacts the budget and Parliament controls the executive. The wish of the British Government in this case is for the 27 governments to control the Parliament, which is the opposite of parliamentary democracy. Therefore, this decision could set a precedent. Parliament must not allow its rights to be taken away.</p>
      <p sl="de">What happens next? After European taxpayers’ money has been transferred to Brussels from the coffers of the Member States, it no longer belongs to the Member States. It is the EU’s money. It must then be controlled by Parliament within the Union. After this, the budget must be adopted by Parliament, because the European budget is not adopted by 27 national parliaments or by 27 national governments, but by a freely elected Parliament, in other words, this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">Medium-term financial planning, the flexibility clause and the own resources are the three elements which we need to discuss with the Council, not the money. We have talked about this over the last few hours. I would like to make it very clear once again that Mr Lamassoure and the chairs of the groups have made a great effort to enable us to take what is, in my opinion, a relatively consistent line. However, we must not now give up this line. We must make it clear to the Council that these three elements concern our rights and not additional spending. Any Parliament which allows its rights to be curtailed by a government of any kind should cease to function.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, my group has unanimously decided that either we will agree on these demands, which are nothing more than an attempt to reinforce Parliament’s rights, or there will be no budget. If there is no budget, there will be no ITER project, no nuclear fusion reactor. There will be no Galileo project and there will be no European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Heads of Government have the choice. They can either recognise the rights of Parliament and its projects or they can humiliate Parliament, in which case there will be no budget. That is the unanimous line taken by my group.</p>

      <p sl="en">The way I see it – and I wonder whether colleagues would agree with me – is that, in a system of separation of powers and checks and balances, the Council actually represents nation states, and whatever remains after the Lisbon Treaty of the sovereignty and independence of nation states.

Incidentally, you are, as far as I know, a member of the Hungarian Jobbik party, or if not, then a member of another party.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in December 2005, there was a Prime Minister who sat here in the House. I think one thing we all learned is that we really need to see a seriously reformed budget for the future. Let us all together – the Commission, the Council, Member States and the European Parliament – work out how, in the next few years, we can build a consensus for a changed and reformed Europe in which the budget is a rational part of the future and not an unfortunate piece of horse-trading.</p>
      <p sl="de">Well, that Prime Minister was Tony Blair, the man who made the last deal on the financial perspectives. Here we are now five years later. What Mr Blair said is the essential thing that Parliament wants to achieve: the engagement of the EU institutions and all involved parties to reinvent the financing of the Union and to base this financing on rational grounds and not on a horse-trading competition, which is the case today.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the figures, let us be very clear. It is no secret that Parliament could be ready to accept the Council figures, of course, within a broader deal. But we need also to agree on a second element, colleagues, which is flexibility. Let us be very clear on this. That flexibility is not a concession from the Council side; flexibility is necessary, indispensable, otherwise we cannot finance a number of important issues. What is more is that flexibility is an ‘acquis’. It forms part of the interinstitutional agreement that we have already. In fact, the Council has broken its word by refusing this now in this budget. Finally, and this is the most important thing, we must agree on the future financing of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, the issue of own resources must be reopened; no doubt about it. Let me be clear that own resources is not a question of changing the treaties. Own resources is also not a question of new competences. It is a question of applying the existing treaties and it is a question of financing existing competences, because the Union was always meant to have its own revenue. Mrs Merkel, Mr Sarkozy and Mr Cameron do not know this, but the Union was founded with its own revenue. That was the basis of the financing of the Union by the founding fathers.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we all know that with time and a contribution from a certain Iron Lady, the Union lost the link to its own resources, so instead we now have absurd discussions about who benefits more and who benefits less from the Union. Not seeking the EU interest but only focusing on the net payment position of every single Member State is what the budget is today in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is called business for the moment in the budget issues of the Union. This way of acting is killing the Union – it is destroying the spirit of unity in the Union and it is destroying the solidarity in the Union. I repeat we can only require genuine own resources which can also lead to what a number of countries want, which is to have less national contributions. If we do not change the system, governments and not citizens will stay in charge. If, on the contrary, we go in the direction of own resources, not governments, but citizens will be in charge. In short, you could say that own resources for Europe colleagues means more European democracy; it is the basis for a modern European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">So I have one request to you Mr Barroso. My request is very simple. Whatever the format is – a convention, a conference, an IGC with or without national parliaments – do not listen to the voices of the past. Go for the future, use your right of initiative and put a formal proposal on the table as fast as possible. The pro-European majority in this House is fully behind you and behind that initiative.</p>

The problem with the budget today, as everyone has said in his or her own way, is a problem to do with the idea of the development of the European idea. It is not just a budget.

      <p sl="fr">We are witnessing the renationalisation – the completely absurd renationalisation – of European activities. Why? Because – and we are all saying it – you want the European Union to successfully resolve problems that you are no longer able to resolve at national level but, at the same time, you want to give the resources for the task not to the European Parliament, but to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we say that we are not defending Parliament’s rights, but only the rights of the European Union and the need for the European Union. That is why whereas, today, we are agreeing on three points, we actually need to agree on one thing, here, together: whether to take it or leave it. Moreover, even if it takes two, three or four months – and it will be tough for everyone – we shall approve the European budget only if there is an agreement on the points we are raising.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not be afraid, then, if it takes a long time and if, as may happen, we do not vote on the budget in December, or even in January or February. If we launch this debate but stop halfway through, we will lose out for the next four years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on everyone to be responsible with regard to own resources, and Mr Verhofstadt has explained this. It is, after all, quite simple, and that is why Mr Lamassoure’s idea of an agreement is interesting, because debates must be held in the European public arena with the national parliaments, with government representatives and with Commissioners. Own resources represent an opportunity to reduce – I shall say it three times – to reduce – that time, it was for the benefit of all the conservatives – to reduce national contributions and, at the same time, to strengthen the European budget. After all, it is not complicated!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, if we can get that message across in the European area, the people of Europe will agree with us. I repeat: we need to reduce national contributions and strengthen the European budget. Yes, there will be European taxes, indeed there will, but the austerity measures you are currently introducing at national level will be disastrous for you anyway, because we have known for years that austerity kills economic momentum and ultimately achieves nothing. I therefore beg you: let us not cripple Europe, because the governments are already crippling their own economies at home.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My final comment concerns Ireland. Ireland symbolises the failure of neoliberalism; it symbolises the failure of deregulation. For years, with Mr Griffith, you have been driving us mad with your ‘deregulate, deregulate, reduce corporation tax’. Well, have you got it yet? This is an economic disaster, and now what is the Irish Government doing? It is crying ‘Mummy, mummy, Europe, help us!’</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to reassure Mr Cohn-Bendit that we understand what it takes not to have a budget. Contrary to what many people may think, the ECR Group would be delighted to see an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority. We feel that it is a shame not to have a budget after all these arduous conciliation talks, because the 500 million taxpayers in Europe do not understand why these two distinguished arms of the budgetary authority cannot reach an agreement in the Lisbon Treaty’s very first year of application.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the responsibility lies with both sides. Parliament does not have to force governments to enter into political commitments that they are unfortunately unable or – for whatever reason – unwilling to make at this point in the midst of a crisis. Nor does Parliament have to enforce these commitments over a longer period of time.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, I can also say that the Council has its fair share of responsibility, because a week ago, when we were negotiating in the conciliation, not a single ambassador bothered to make any statement explaining the views of his or her own government. Therefore, it was a kind of dialogue between two sides which were not even stating their own proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is preparing a new draft based on the 2.91% growth figure. At this point, I should like to acknowledge and express my appreciation for the tremendous work Commissioner Lewandowski is doing in that respect. We can reach a compromise if we can agree to use flexibility – which is not a good use of terminology, by the way, because we should be using ‘reserve’ – as part of the interinstitutional agreement for the remaining three years to finance ITER and a few other key projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, Parliament could decide not to force any political declaration on the Council which is unacceptable to several key governments at this time. That is how we can reach a compromise. I think Mr Wathelet is working very hard on this. I can only encourage you to pursue this, Mr Wathelet, because it will be an even bigger shame if we cannot reach an agreement before the end of this year.</p>

I will continue to say that one of the reasons for the catastrophe in Ireland was the wrong economic policies. Greens also participated in this to make it wrong. I know that. I can say it clearly. I am not blind, and I will continue to say that it was the wrong policy. If you pursue a wrong policy and it leads to a catastrophe, it is fair to say that it was the wrong policy. If it had been the right policy, you would not be in this catastrophe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The others who are responsible are the European banks. They played casino, but if you lose money as a normal human being in a casino, you have lost money.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon have emphasised the fact that it does away with the democratic deficit in the EU. In reality, the first year has shown that the European Parliament has had to fight with the Council and the Commission simply to achieve parliamentary codecision and democratic control.</p>
      <p sl="de">The codecision of Parliament on all budgetary questions is a democratic minimum standard. I repeat: it is a minimum standard. This Parliament was elected to bring the European ideal to life and to act as a counterbalance to national egotism. It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets.</p>
      <p sl="de">New tasks cannot be financed by budget reallocations, or at least only to a very limited extent. When faced by the tight budgets in the Member States, it is completely incomprehensible that the Council is refusing to discuss the own resources with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European budget must be a concrete representation of the solidarity of the Member States. Otherwise, we will move away from the fundamental idea of European integration and lose the respect of the citizens of Europe. The net contributors seem to have forgotten this. While their companies are making profits on the European internal market, Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe. Solidarity has been redefined and one Member State will only help the others when this is to its own advantage.</p>
      <p sl="de">The German banks are so deeply enmeshed in the crisis in the Irish financial sector that the lifeline is just as important for the rescuers as it is for those being rescued. In recent years, my group has rejected the EU budget. We believe that its priorities are wrong and that too little attention has been paid to overcoming the decline in environmental and social prosperity. This has deepened the social divide within the EU and within the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is totally unacceptable for major projects such as ITER to be financed at the expense of projects which provide direct funding for students, the unemployed, rural areas and local communities. To summarise, it is high time, and I admit this is a somewhat simplistic way of putting it, for us to think more closely about the people of Europe in European terms and not in egotistic national terms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let us be honest. Negotiations on next year’s budget collapsed due to this Parliament’s ambition to acquire more power over the financing of the European Union, even though those powers are not provided for in the Lisbon Treaty. Such a demand – which translates into the proposal for a European tax – is, and has always been, unacceptable to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been threats to block funding to the Member States which refuse to agree to Parliament’s demands. Believe me, this would be the best news we could give to British and all European taxpayers – those who eventually fund both national contributions and a European tax. The auditors have refused to clear 92% of the European Union’s expenditure for 2009, and they estimate that at least GBP 6 billion should not have been paid out – a similar amount to that of last year, which has not yet been recovered. Blocking funding for those who used EU money irregularly would give the European Union enough resources to cover the noble causes that it claims it wants to support. At the same time, it would also give the European bureaucracy a certain degree of credibility. But this, I fear, will never happen.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three equal partners are sitting around the negotiating table for the 2011 budget: the Council, the Commission and Parliament. The European Parliament has agreed to the budget increase of 2.9% proposed by the Council, but only in combination with a political package. In the context of the Treaty of Lisbon, this is a highly justified demand. With regard to the extent of the increase, I think it is important to make it clear that we are still working with an EU budget volume which goes back to the time when there were 15 Member States and, therefore, it is geared to a Union of this size. However, there are now 27 states in the Union with a range of new tasks to be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the light of the economic crisis, it seems incomprehensible that we are increasing the EU budget. However, we have to take into consideration the fact that almost 95% of the money is returned to the citizens of Europe in the form of direct aid, for example, via the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. It must ultimately be clear to everyone that the current budgetary situation in some of the Member States is self-imposed. The fact is that without a 2011 budget, the three financial supervisory bodies cannot be funded. Given the current drama in Ireland, it would have been good if these organisations could have begun work yesterday.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that no one can take pleasure in this lack of conciliation on 15 November. It is true that we would have preferred to have had an entirely different debate today, with the end of a conciliation procedure that might have culminated in an agreement and in the possibility of this budget being passed in the European Parliament also.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that we were certainly all disappointed that this conciliation procedure was not a success. At the same time, however, I have heard both within the Commission, which has acted as a facilitator, which has truly played its role of facilitator all throughout the procedure, and especially within Parliament, a desire and a reminder of this strong desire to succeed and to seek success rather than failure. I have also heard it within the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore true that the Belgian Presidency, immediately after the failure – we must clearly regard it as such – of 15 November, sought to resume immediate contact and to press ahead in a bid to ensure that this first budgetary procedure based on the Treaty of Lisbon is a success rather than a failure. However, I would remind you that every single one of us will always be able to find reasons not to succeed, and that is how the conciliation process broke down. Parliament will always be able to find proposals that the Council has made that it does not agree with, and the Council will always be able to find certain proposals that Parliament has made that are unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There will always be a way not to succeed. However, I have heard both institutions express a desire to succeed. It is important now that we all assume our responsibilities and successfully conclude this agreement rather than remain stuck in this rut.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, what message would we send if we failed to conclude this conciliation with an agreement? What image would the European Union project convey to the outside world, in this particularly unstable and difficult economic context, if it were unable, at this difficult time, to stick together, as it were, and make the necessary compromises between institutions in order to conclude a budget, in order to successfully conclude an agreement between our various institutions?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us make no mistake: aside from image, aside from an initial failure linked to this budgetary procedure based on the Treaty of Lisbon, there would also be very real consequences – and they would affect the people of Europe in particular. Some of these consequences have already been mentioned, because a provisional twelfths budget means a ‘zero growth’ budget, not to mention inflation. There is also a European External Action Service that could be in difficulty; financial supervision bodies that could be placed in a difficult situation; cohesion policies – I would remind you that the proposed budget provided for a 14% increase in payment appropriations – and, hence, cohesion policy funds that might not be released; yet more problems linked to the 2020 strategy; and political priorities that Parliament holds dear and which had been integrated into this 2011 draft budget, mainly under heading 1a, such as mobility, young people and education – policies that may well not be implemented either.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, aside from the negative image that the lack of an agreement could convey, it would also have very tangible, very real, very specific consequences that would certainly not help to improve the European Union’s image in the eyes of the citizens themselves. It follows that, if we want to reverse this trend, if we want to remain credible, if we want to assume this share of the responsibility, we must take advantage of these last few weeks in order to reach an agreement and emerge from this spiral of conflict.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be clear: to do so, we need to bear in mind three things. Firstly, there is the 2011 budget as such, with its figures, a budget on which – and I have heard it said by a number of group chairs here – an agreement could be reached with regard to the 2.91% increase in payment appropriations. We could reach an agreement on the figures as such, on the 2011 budget, on what is, in fact, on the agenda today. I should like to reiterate that we know that this entails a number of concessions for the European Parliament. We know that, when it comes to the 2011 budget, Parliament has made a number of concessions with regard to its initial demands.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second topic that almost all of you have mentioned is the multiannual financial framework for the financing of ITER, which relates to the issue of flexibility. Once again, the Belgian Presidency, in seeking to support this principle of agreement, immediately put the flexibility-related proposals back on the table. This is the context in which we are working at the moment. I would remind you, however, that we will need to be unanimous if we are to take the flexibility issue further, that this must be understood in a number of areas, and, in particular, that it must preserve the neutrality of the budget during the period in which the multiannual financial framework is in force.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will also need to take advantage of any opportunities for redeployment and transfer before referring to this flexibility idea. However, we can make progress. If everyone makes the necessary efforts, I believe we can make progress on this flexibility idea, on this task, and on this objective of financing ITER in 2012-2013, alongside the issue of the 2011 budget in the strictest sense.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There remains a third topic that you have also mentioned: political declarations. On this point, I must say that the Council cannot say any more than what was said on Monday in conciliation, although I know that Parliament was unable to agree with that at the time. I know that the commitments that were mentioned seemed too weak to Parliament but, once again, we will have an opportunity again to raise these issues and to debate them between us. We shall have to hold these debates because Articles 311, 312 and 324 of the treaty mention a number of consultations that must take place between our various institutions, and we shall ensure that they do take place because they are provided for in the treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The declaration referred to Articles 312 and 324, pursuant to which we shall have to hold these debates in the future between our various institutions. Once again, however, we will hear a whole host of reasons for not wanting an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I have perceived a will to succeed among the Members of the Council and within Parliament. Do we really want to act as scaremongers by telling each other that we prefer not to have a budget, not to implement the policies that are provided for in the 2011 budget and not to make a success of the first budget based on the Treaty of Lisbon, or, in fact, do we want to embark on a positive course of action whereby we obtain, one by one, a number of agreements to enable the European Union to move forward and to allow for the implementation, via the 2011 budget, of a number of policies that we have decided to promote? I hope that it really is with this aim in mind that we take advantage of the next few weeks to ensure that this first procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon is a success rather than a failure.</p>

    <intervention id="2-420" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by fully exercising their right of initiative, the Members of the Commission have just decided in a meeting held here in Strasbourg that the Commission will be presenting a new draft budget in the next few days, on 1 December at the latest. We hope that Parliament and the Council will approve it in the coming fortnight.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This draft will take up all the points that we agreed upon before the conciliation that ended last week. In fact, we were very close to an agreement, and I wish to thank everyone who has worked in this spirit, a true European spirit of compromise. It is a shame that in the end, an agreement has not been possible. However, I am keen to underline the role of Commissioner Lewandowski, who has contributed all his energy and expertise, the role of many people in this House, but also the very constructive role of the Belgian Presidency, which I thank for having done and which is continuing to do everything possible to reach an agreement. I believe that the draft that we are going to present deserves your support and that of the Council, and that it will enable us to come up with a budget before the end of this year, so that the Union may have a budget by 1 January 2011. Furthermore, I believe that it would be very difficult to explain to Europe’s citizens that in a crisis such as the one we are currently going through in Europe, we are unable to reach an agreement on the budget, which really is a symbol of Europe’s ability to respond to challenges, challenges such as the one that Ireland or the European economy is having to face up to at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our proposal will take full account of the proposal made by Parliament to increase the commitments under the headings ‘Competitiveness for growth and employment’ and ‘External relations’, through the use of the flexibility instrument. It will fix the level of payments with an increase of 2.91%. I am convinced that this proposal will enable us to strike a balance that can be supported.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It goes without saying that this agreement must be clear on matters relating to ‘future financing’. We must show that all the parties involved clearly understand the implications of the treaty and that close cooperation between the institutions at the highest political level is a natural consequence of our mutual commitment to adopt the best financial framework for the future. The Commission will take all the initiatives required for an ongoing and fruitful dialogue at all levels, including amongst the Presidents of the institutions, in order to draw up a common plan that will allow for the necessary decisions to be taken. May I remind you of President Buzek’s important speech to the European Council on 27 October, which served to underline the enhanced role of the European Parliament, including in budgetary matters, that is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, a role that I have also had the opportunity to draw attention to, by supporting your President’s speech before the 27 Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to be very clear on the Commission’s position regarding a number of key points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, as emerged from the recent review of the budget, we will use our right of initiative to present formal proposals on own resources before the end of June. Clearly, pursuant to the treaty, the European Parliament will have to be consulted on these proposals, which is in line with the expectations arising from the interinstitutional agreement concluded in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we will argue the need to take full account of the changes envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon when we present proposals, both for future budgets and for the multiannual financial framework as a whole. The budget must reflect the Union’s revised priorities arising from the treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must also make it clear that, as the review of the budget has shown, the flexibility in our budgets means that the resources that we have are concentrated on the Union’s political objectives. Therefore, flexibility must be clearly maintained to allow for adoption by a qualified majority of revisions of less than 0.03% of gross national income.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To this end, I sincerely hope that we will receive positive news very shortly from the Council, so that we have the right political conditions to ensure the success of the 2011 budget adoption procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The recent review of the Union’s budget, as presented by the Commission, has clearly shown the importance we give to optimising the added value of EU expenditure. We cannot waste the opportunity that we are being given to ensure that the Union’s budget really makes a difference by promoting our ambitions and implementing the objectives of the treaty. The Commission will draft a methodology aimed at demonstrating the added value of the budget, and we are also prepared to set about quantifying the costs of a ‘non-Europe’. We must state very clearly that the advantages of Union membership cannot just come down to numbers and figures. While we are focusing on the costs of the budget, we must also focus more closely on those who really benefit from the Union’s policies and not only on the annual budgetary costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, these are clear commitments that I am making before you today, on behalf of the Commission. I will confirm them in writing to the Presidents of Parliament and of the Council. If it helps to obtain this agreement, we are also prepared to reiterate them in the form of declarations to be annexed to an agreement between the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that many people, on all sides, have felt during this debate that the next multiannual financial framework will be a crucial test for Europe, and I share their point of view. It will be a test of our ability to bring about real change for millions of Europeans, to use this powerful tool to stimulate our ambition for a Europe focused on growth and sustainable jobs for the future, a strong Europe on the international stage, and a Europe based on the values to which we subscribe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It will also be a test of our ability to draft an intelligent budget, focused on the areas in which resources can best be deployed and culminating in tangible results, and not on a misdirected budget, because preference was given to political compromise rather than to the quality and efficiency of our spending.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, as the last few weeks have shown, it may be, above all, a test of our system of governance, of our ability not only to present sound arguments but also to recognise that the strength of our Union and of the Treaty of Lisbon lies in finding the best solutions to achieve our shared objectives. The proposals that the Commission will be presenting next June require major efforts to achieve the necessary consensus. The Commission will be open to any ideas on how to structure the debate around our proposals on the solid foundations of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the issues at stake in the discussions currently being held are huge. They deserve our full attention. I am convinced that all the parties will be determined to reach an agreement. We have the broad outline of a solution based on the possibilities being offered in the current conditions which, I would stress, are very, very sensitive conditions that require all of us – Parliament, Council and the Commission – to be more responsible than we already are.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must not forget that we are discussing the budget and not a secondary issue. We are discussing one of the main tools that the Union has at its disposal. This tool, far from being a luxury that we can do without during difficult periods, is absolutely essential if we wish to restore growth in Europe, create employment and generate prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European budget is different from national budgets. I would emphasise this point because people are sometimes very quick to make comparisons. For a start, the European budget has no deficit: it is always balanced. It is different from the Member States’ budgets as it is primarily an investment budget that contributes to growth, and we know how much we need this investment right now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This tool is therefore too important to be jeopardised. Europe needs the European Union to have a budget. It is not a budget for Brussels, but a budget for the European citizens. It is a budget for unemployed people who are currently looking for a new job. It is a budget for the regions of Europe. It is a budget for innovation in Europe. We must therefore make it clear that it is not a budget for bureaucracy and bureaucrats. It is a budget for the people of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must prevent the disruption that further disputes would cause and any uncertainties linked to provisional twelfths. They are not simply uncertainties; they are real losses for real citizens. If provisional twelfths alone were applied, our citizens would not understand how issues, even very important ones, could hinder a budget that has a direct impact on the livelihoods and prospects of citizens throughout the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why I am confident that, with an additional commitment – and I appeal to the European spirit, especially of those who failed to show it last time – it will be possible to have a 2011 budget and to lay the foundations for a truly serious discussion on the prospects for financing the European Union in the future.</p>

Nevertheless, we feel that a strong and well-financed European budget is a valuable and essential tool for restarting the EU economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Blocking, reducing or watering down the European budget is paradoxically contrary to the interests of the 27 Member States and 500 million Europeans. If we do not have flexibility for the next three years, we will not implement the post-Lisbon policies. Without a political agreement between Parliament and the Council on own resources or cooperation on the next multiannual financial framework, there will be no political or financial stability. It is not simply a question of rights, but a question of common interest. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are entitled to come to this House as political opponents, but no one knows whom they are opposing. This does not, however, benefit anyone, nor does it benefit the ‘cohesion countries’.</p>
      <p sl="es">Although there is many a political leader currently interested in the 2011 budget, I would like to remind you that I have 14 years of political experience of budgetary conciliation. Nothing that has ever been achieved in terms of budgets over all those years has been achieved through confrontation. We have always achieved things through cooperation. Posturing, whether in this House or in the Justus Lipsius building, where it also happens, is of no practical use whatsoever.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Parliament is being called upon to confirm its approach, an approach of responsibility, vision and unity.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as responsibility is concerned, we wish to give Europe a dignified budget. European citizens, young people, enterprises, farmers, municipalities and regions, workers and the unemployed need a budget with a moderate, sustainable and realistic increase.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we do not yet have this budget, it is not the fault of a spendthrift Parliament, which forgets we are living through times of crisis. Instead, it is the fault of some selfish, falsely moralistic national governments, as quick to jump on their soapboxes as they are unwilling, as in the case of Great Britain, to relinquish their claim to nearly 30 years of unfair privileges. If three governments are selfish and bad, the other 24 cannot be subject to their will but must react, Mr President, Mr Wathelet. They must show what they are made of!</p>
      <p sl="it">We hold the future of our citizens very dear when it comes to our vision for the future. The Treaty of Lisbon and the EU 2020 strategy set us new tasks, new duties, new ambitions to build a better tomorrow. How will we achieve these tasks? How will we put our shared ambitions into practice? What money can we use to enter into another imbroglio, like the Lisbon Strategy, which was never achieved but certainly not for want of trying by the European Parliament?</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, when we speak of unity, we mean unity between MEPs and unity with the Commission. President Barroso's speech this evening was good. We do not need soothing, we need to flex our muscle with reason but with determination We have unity on this matter and this is a valuable asset, an extraordinary strength that represents 500 million citizens.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to say to both Mr Wathelet and Mr Barroso that I most definitely agree that there should be an agreement. Of course we must have one. That is Parliament’s opinion, too, and it is also why we were so willing to accept the compromise that the Council came up with, because the Council is not in agreement over how big the budget should be either. We accepted the 2.91% increase in payment appropriations. In return, we have to demand that we have the prospect of getting a proper budget in future years. It is a question of flexibility. It is also a question of engaging in a dialogue regarding the budget for future years.</p>
      <p sl="da">This issue of flexibility is a very tangible one. With the aid of flexibility, we have been able to fulfil new requests. We would not have been able to get energy projects off the ground as part of the recovery plan – for example, by linking electricity networks from the Baltic countries with those from the Nordic countries, or linking the gas network in Bulgaria with those of Western Europe, so that Russia is no longer able to cut off our heating – if we had not found the money for this in the agricultural budget. We need to have this sort of possibility of moving resources around in the EU budget. We must, therefore, have flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is also important for there to be constructive dialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, including with the national parliaments, concerning the EU’s budget after 2013. The European Parliament must not be placed in a situation where we can only say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the medium-term financial perspectives. There is a risk that we will say ‘no’; there is a risk that it will go the same way as it did with the SWIFT agreement.</p>
      <p sl="da">The EU’s own resources are to be reformed again. It is not a question of creating an EU tax burden; it is about creating a transparent and comprehensible system, without special rules and without rebates, so that we have a system that citizens can understand. We need a debate now, and I am therefore pleased that the Commission has promised to take the initiative and come up with a proposal before next summer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to emphasise once again that for this House, this self-assured European Parliament, the important issue is to honour the Treaty of Lisbon. This is not about going beyond the terms of the treaty, as Mr Barroso has already so rightly said, but it is about keeping to the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the additional powers for Parliament, ensuring that the Council does not turn back the clock and adhering to the arrangement on how we work together and how we come to an agreement between Parliament and the Council. This was laid down in 2006 in the interinstitutional agreement. All we want is for this to be confirmed again. Thank you very much, Mr Barroso, you have rightly highlighted this issue once more.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Wathelet has now attempted to persuade the House not to make such rapid progress towards a genuinely pro-European future, but instead to hold back. If we do that, we will already be admitting defeat. As Mr Schulz has said, this is, in fact, about a political dispute. How will we handle the increased powers of the European Parliament and the Member States which are behaving in a more and more eurosceptic way? If we want the European Union and its citizens to have a powerful future, including at a global level, Parliament and the Council must reach a pro-European consensus. Therefore, we must not give in at too early a stage. Instead, we must fight for European added value, because this is in the interests of both the national governments and our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, as Mr Schulz said, this is not just a debate about the budget, but it is also a debate about the future form of the European Union, and that is a fact. It can clearly be heard here that beneath the budget debate, among other things, there is a hidden debate on how best to push through the European Union’s own financial resources, and therefore greater autonomy, and how to actually move the European Union further along the path to federalism.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, of course, this is something quite unacceptable, which cannot and must not happen. Moreover, I have to say that it is now tiresome to hear the persistently unfriendly tone towards the Council here, and that it is childish to listen to the various ultimatums and threats. If the European Parliament takes this path, and if the confrontational tone we have heard from a number of Members continues, only one thing will happen: the European Parliament will be the loser, both with the media and with the public.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, millions of Portuguese workers are going to go on strike. They are going to go on strike with a very simple message: it is not those who work, it is not pensioners, it is not young people, and it is not the unemployed who should pay for a crisis for which they were not responsible. The current deadlock over the European budget cannot be understood without analysing its context, which is one of social tragedy and austerity policies that are being imposed on our countries. Austerity policies are not just unfair: they are a colossal economic mistake which promise to drag the European Union back into recession, which promise a future of unemployment, and which, above all, promise to accentuate the divergence between the countries in surplus and those in deficit.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, we must be very clear about this debate on the budget. We do not believe that there can be a currency without a substantial budget behind it and – let us be realistic – the 2011 budget under discussion is not just modest: it is a mediocre budget; it is a budget that does not respond to the crisis but is part of the crisis. That is exactly why it is important it is not repeated in 2012, in 2013 or after 2014.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the issue that we are discussing; the issue of the future: do we want a Europe controlled by governments or a Europe that continues to be a Trojan horse for the interests of the financial system? In fact, the European left is interested in discussing own resources. We do not want new taxes on the European public, but we definitely do want to discuss how to make financial capital pay what it has not been paying: pay what it owes. That is the message that the public – the workers and the unemployed – are demanding from this House and from the European Union. Either we want a European project that has so little ambition to fly that it barely makes it off the ground, or we make it clear that we will not be content with the scenario being put to us by the United Kingdom and a group of governments, which is ‘do more with less money, because that is the Europe that we are offering you’.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, how pleased I am with the position of the UK and Dutch governments, in particular, so far! Using excellent arguments, they have managed to prevent the increase in the EU budget for 2011 and have refused to agree to the introduction of own resources, for which, read European taxes. Well done, I say. At the same time, I do have to say that I regret that the European Parliament is not willing to learn anything from the lesson that Member States are teaching it. The Euro clique, removed from reality as they are, thought they were just going to get a little bit more money for their own hobbies. They have now completely lost touch with what is going on in the minds of their own citizens. They keep asking for more and more, while Parliament and the Commission should just be marking time or even cutting their spending. Not a bit of it. The Netherlands and the other Member States have extremely good reasons for rejecting the increase in the EU budget and the introduction of European taxes. We are doing this for democratic reasons and find it entirely inappropriate that some in this House, such as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), seem to think that the Netherlands ought to be punished for that. As a founding member of the EU, the Netherlands has almost always been the largest net contributor to the EU budget. We are talking about Dutch taxpayers’ money. Is Mr Daul now going to call for sanctions against other Member States? Is this the end of the EU? One might almost wish it were, considering how the interests of our citizens are being bargained away. That is really sad, Mr President, but it is we who are then going to be subject to accusations of being populist. If populism means that we are listening closely to what people are saying, that we are representing them and offering really watertight arguments about extracting ourselves from the economic crisis, which the EU has also forced upon us, then I shall be happy to wear that title with pride. Obviously, we will continue to oppose the increase in the 2011 budget and European taxes. By the way, Mr Schulz, before you start, I am not blond.</p>

The revenue side of the budget has been waiting for a reform for years. The Treaty of Lisbon said that income had to be provided from our own resources. So why not? Why can we not deliberate on this? For years, experts have been saying that the European budget is inflexible, that this is what renders the European Union a lame duck. So why do we not create a flexible budget?</p>
      <p sl="hu">We cannot respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing world while hogtied – hogtied by a seven-year budget – but, at the same time, we should not disregard those basic European principles which state that differences of opinion must be resolved in an open debate and through compromise. It is unacceptable that there are states which are not even willing to engage in a debate. This means the end of the European spirit. We continue to be open to discussion, and the responsibility lies with those that are reluctant to engage.</p>

The European Parliament has shown a lot of goodwill in accepting the figures for 2011 because we understand the economic situation in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding commitments, it is even, in real terms, a reduction of the budget. We have also offered solutions to a number of practical things like ITER institutions, like the financial supervisory authorities and the External Action Service; we have been constructive. But we do not accept that the economic crisis will be here for ever and that the crisis should set the limits for the future of Europe. We do not accept that single-minded austerity is the way out. We do not accept that the crisis requires less Europe or an anti-European agenda. More concretely, we have criticised the lack of flexibility in the European Union budget for years, and the Commission agrees with us. So how can the solution to the budget problems suddenly be to restrict flexibility?</p>
      <p sl="en">How can the future of Europe be to cut funding of mutually agreed priority programmes and not fund new ones – ITER is not the only priority – or even the most important ones.

For me and many others, this has actually been a question of a genuine concern about the future, a concern about how we are to get through the years ahead and the coming decade. It is important to remember that we have jointly succeeded in agreeing on a quite – or rather very – ambitious 2020 strategy for Europe – a strategy that is to take Europe forwards. However, it is naive to believe that such a strategy will finance itself or implement itself. It is surely also a given that this strategy and its successes will not merely be a question of money. Unfortunately, however, this will also come into play to a certain extent.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Neither the Council nor the Commission have yet succeeded in presenting plans for the coming years with which we are sufficiently impressed, which is one of the reasons why we ended up in the state of conflict that we found ourselves in recently. I would like to say to the Council that you very much like to be included in the family portrait after having approved the Treaty of Lisbon and succeeded in agreeing on the 2020 strategy. All of the eminent people happily stand there and tell everyone how much they like Europe, but when it comes to doing something and actually implementing these things, the Council suddenly has problems. These are problems that are now reflected in the fact that we suddenly have a budgetary crisis, and these are problems that the Council, as pointed out here, ought to attend to and find solutions for, because the fact is that this is not just about next year’s budget; it is about the future.

The last vote in the European Parliament did not show such restraint, and it is, of course, a good sign that there is now agreement on the numbers between Parliament and the Council, though I think we could have gone even lower. It is depressing, however, that despite agreeing the numbers, there is still no agreement on the budget.</p>

Its demand that it have a say in the funding of the European Union in the long term includes an EU tax, although it has not called it that in so many words. In so doing, the European Parliament is leaving itself open to the suspicion that it does not want to play a constructive role in the annual budgetary procedure, in accordance with Article 234 of the treaty. That does not bode very well for the financial perspective for the 2014-2020 period with which Parliament so badly wants to be involved. With the 2.91% budget increase, the European Parliament has already achieved more than is good for Europe and its citizens and companies and the budgets of Member States.

At a time when everyone is having to save and when our citizens are having to tighten their belts, arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget is sending out totally the wrong message. The EU is just seizing new powers for itself and wants more money to that end. Well then, there are plenty of opportunities for making serious savings. According to the European Court of Auditors, the financial impact of irregularities in the agricultural policy accounts for 2-5% of the spending on agriculture. The financial margin of error for regional funds is more than 5%, which therefore exceeds the two most important expenditure items in the budget. We therefore need better control of how funds are spent and more stringent sanctions for erroneous, unlawful and fraudulent use. Instead of just urging an increase in revenue all the time, Parliament should also discuss savings every so often. A direct EU tax, which is what the Commission wants, is unacceptable for several reasons. It is yet another step towards a European superstate, it will inevitably lead to ever more spending and it will also inevitably lead – as, indeed, Commissioner Lewandowski has admitted – to an increase in the overall tax burden of net contributors, which will just not sell at the moment.</p>

The same is also true for the Europe 2020 action programme.</p>

I think the lowest point in our reconciliation was when the Council refused to start discussions, and the second lowest was when it refused to start discussions on the basis of documents proposed by the Commission regarding the political part of our discussions. But discussions are in the treaty, and they are in at least two parts.

The European Parliament cannot pretend to be immune from this. It is not right in such a difficult situation for Parliament to demand a 6% increase in the budget.

I would also like to express my thanks for the involvement of the European Commission. However, our efforts are not over. On the contrary, we should, now, intensify them. Personally, I think the fiasco of the 2011 budget negotiations is a defeat for all of us. However, I would like to share with you my interpretation as to why Monday’s fiasco happened.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We were witnesses to a regrettable situation in which several Member States prolonged the negotiations until midnight to make them end in failure. We did not manage to finish the negotiations on time, because on the part of several Member States, there was simply not the will to talk. It is for me, personally, an exasperating and very surprising situation, when around the negotiating table are seated diplomats and deputy ministers of finance and they do not want to talk about finance or about the future financing and the present financing of the European Union. It is absolutely incomprehensible and unacceptable to me, because what is to happen next, if the politicians and diplomats do not want to talk to each other?</p>
      <p sl="pl">My next point is that the tension concerning discussion of the 2011 budget began because the European Parliament wants to draw the attention of Member States to a problem which we see in the future and which we can already see today: that the European Union continues to take on new roles and start new areas of activity and that it has growing ambitions, but that at the same time, the Member States, which support those ambitions, also do not want to finance those ambitions, those plans, those actions and those new areas. We must talk about this growing inconsistency. At a time of crisis, it is all the more important to talk about finance and to talk about how the European Union is to be financed. Furthermore, the European Parliament is all the more necessary and it is not, at the moment, the right time to make the budget a taboo subject.</p>

This is a problem for the beneficiaries, but it is also, in fact, a serious political crisis which, in my opinion, stems from the fact that somewhere, the spirit of euro-enthusiasm has been lost. That spirit of euro-enthusiasm was felt in the European Parliament when we discussed the Treaty of Lisbon, and those who were not very keen on Europe were urged to be more enthusiastic. However, when the treaty negotiations ended and integration was improved, the discussions about money and the budget started, and it turned out that instead of euro-enthusiasm, there was euro-egoism and a desire to pay as little as possible for that increased European integration. I would like more euro-enthusiasm over the budget.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned, but not about the budget, the interinstitutional agreement or a possible twelve-part budget. I have a general concern about the political situation facing the European Union, which has come to light today in the context of the budget. I am concerned about the trend for intergovernmental cooperation and about the fact that the increased powers of Parliament are obviously going to be curtailed and that even the agreement made in 2006 is not being respected. I am concerned that the Treaty of Lisbon is not being put into effect. (Applause) Mr Barroso, I welcome your statements. However, perhaps it would have been more helpful if you had come 10 days earlier, to make it clearer that the Commission is on Parliament’s side.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the three main subjects of our negotiations, the first one that I would like to discuss is the flexibility instrument. There has obviously been some movement in this area. However, I have recently heard that there have been setbacks during the parallel negotiations in Brussels. What is happening there? Is there a possibility, and is this too much to ask, of agreeing on the same level of flexibility that we had before the Treaty of Lisbon, which was the right solution and which was achieved after many years of negotiations, starting with the Agenda 2000? Is it too much to ask in the case of own resources to commit to the continuation of what we – the Council, the Commission and Parliament – said in 2006 in our statement on the interinstitutional agreement? Is it too much to ask that those people who are rejecting the idea of a debate on own resources should try reading the treaty? The treaty states that this debate must take place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, Mr President, is it too much to ask for us to enter into binding political agreements on all the issues relating to assent procedures so that we can prevent crises from occurring and so that we do not find ourselves in the same position on other questions, including external trade agreements and the next multiannual financial framework? If you present these things in the form that you have today, the answer from this House will be a definite ‘no’.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Member States are clearly going through a difficult time from a budgetary perspective. On the other hand, it has been very obvious that the EU budget has made a major contribution to the development of every Member State, including net contributors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am surprised that the failure of conciliation was not due to a disagreement over figures, but to the refusal to have a practical discussion about the common future of Member States, in other words, the future of Europe. Parliament does not wish to go beyond its remit. It wants the treaty to be complied with and to protect the future interests of the citizens who elected it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Which points has the Council refused to discuss?</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Parliament’s involvement in drafting the MFF is a provision of the treaty. This task was performed in 2006 and I do not believe that the 2007-2013 budget was bad for the Union. Quite the contrary.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Flexibility – this mechanism has been used effectively so far and all Member States have benefited from it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Own resources – it is precisely the budgetary situation which Member States are going through that should spur them on to find stable methods of funding the European budget which will stop jeopardising the implementation of European policies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The new responsibilities under the treaty and the 2020 strategy require funding. It is not acceptable for the same institution, the Council, to set targets for 2020 and, at the same time, not approve the financial resources required to meet these demands. I believe that we have a duty to reach an agreement. We have a responsibility to our citizens. We must not allow confidence to wane in Europe’s institutions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this week, we should have approved the European Union General Budget for 2011. Instead, we find ourselves faced with a situation where Europe runs a serious risk of having to start the New Year with a provisional budget and greatly hindered by the application of the system of twelfths.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is common knowledge that Parliament, the Commission and most Member States were ready to reach an agreement, which was blocked by a minority of countries that refused to open a constructive debate with Parliament on the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that Parliament’s position during the negotiations was responsible and moderate. Parliament called for the application of the Treaty of Lisbon, and continues to call for it forcefully.</p>
      <p sl="it">For its part, the Council has proved itself incapable of reaching an agreement and has shown itself to be deeply divided over matters of fundamental importance, which a minority of States have vetoed, rejecting the idea of opening a debate with Parliament over the rules and procedures that should guide the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now, however, we are obliged to look to the future, and build the Europe of the future together – and by that I mean the Council, Parliament and Commission – without selfishness or prevarication. By agreeing to the limits imposed by the Council on the growth figure, the 2.91% we are all familiar with, Parliament’s aim is to send out a strong signal that it is sensitive to the period we are living through.</p>
      <p sl="it">We all agree, however, as the Commission also affirmed today, that we should ask for greater flexibility to meet the needs of Europe. I agree with President Barroso’s words today when he referred to the proposals that the Commission will draw up for the use of its own resources and the adaptation of the EU budget to the Treaty of Lisbon, and I hope for greater cooperation by the Council in building the Europe of the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in the negotiations with the Council on the 2011 budget, the European Parliament did everything in order for agreement to be reached. The only demand is to fulfil the Council’s undertakings, for example, the Europe 2020 strategy and the need to finance it, and to comply with the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In truth, under the treaty, the European Parliament has to be involved – by voting, giving opinions, or being consulted – in the new interinstitutional agreement, in the next multiannual financial framework and in establishing new own resources. These demands are logical, reasonable, in the public interest, and in the interests of preventing interinstitutional risks and conflicts: they are demands that the Council should share and uphold.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards the interinstitutional agreement, it is obvious that respect for the commitments made by European institutions, specifically the Council, is conditional on the existence of flexibility regarding the current multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Europe 2020 strategy, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor programme, the European External Action Service and the financial supervision entities are some examples of things that need financing. The Council needs to take the Treaty of Lisbon on board, both from the point of view of the areas newly under the jurisdiction of the European Union, which are reflected in the budget, and from the point of view of the European Parliament’s strengthened powers, not least regarding the budget. These changes in fact strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union’s institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The use of the Community method rather than the intergovernmental approach makes our governance more democratic. I hope that a few national egos do not obstruct the European project of peace, solidarity and progress, or put it at risk.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this has been a most important debate – particularly the political aspects of it – but I think it is also important to talk about some of the practical parts of the debate. I am the rapporteur for agriculture for the 2011 Budget, and there will be real implications if we do not reach agreement on the budget for the cash-flow of Member States who have made advance payments to their farmers in recent weeks. These farmers are facing financial difficulties and income shortages. So there are very real and practical implications and this is just one of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let me talk about the future. Right now, we are debating the future of the common agricultural policy and we are asking that policy to deliver more for Europe in terms of environmental issues, food security and the territorial dimension, and yet all of the debate thus far has been about how can we shrink the agriculture budget. I am very concerned that, in this debate about budget 2011, we are projecting a very negative view of the budget for agriculture and the European Union post-2013. The two are very much linked and I think we need to be aware of that.</p>

For the past ten years, we have been telling citizens that research and development can be better accomplished and financed at EU level. We have been telling them that European space policy can be better accomplished at EU level, and we have been telling them that energy research and the fight against climate change can be better accomplished in the European Union than it could be at Member State level. When we believed this, stood for this, we thought that we were telling the truth. In for a penny, in for a pound. If, to this day, we still believe what we have been saying for the last ten years, we must create the necessary budgetary resources, and the primary means of achieving this is flexibility, while the secondary means is the creation of Parliament’s own resources, the European Union’s own resources.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the trialogue represents a major political opportunity to reflect on Europe's recent history.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem is not merely political but also cultural and involves many Member States. The current economic and financial crisis is structural and not a passing phenomenon. It actually represents a transformation that affects the economy, employment and society of the age in which we live. If there is no political and cultural growth with a global vision of Europe, we will not be able to take action to overcome problems linked with the start of the third millennium, such as welfare, research, energy and environmental policy and security, which can be dealt with only by a political coming together of all states making up the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">My message to my fellow MEPs is that while the trialogue has failed, the work carried out by Parliament is distinguished work that fully meets our mandate to represent the people. Nowadays, Parliament counts more due to the Treaty of Lisbon and the Council can no longer take a dominant role against the popular sovereignty represented by Parliament …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the traditional representatives of the European Parliament are calling for extensive flexibility in the budget, but I have noticed that no one has mentioned the interests of the net contributors or the interests of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is ultimately the net contributors which finance the EU, which were responsible for restarting the engine of the economy after the crisis, which rescued the countries with budget deficits and the euro itself and which are imposing a heavy burden on their citizens. In my opinion, it is therefore quite comprehensible and justifiable that these countries and their citizens want to keep to the budgetary appropriations, ensure that the net balance cannot be changed retrospectively on a whim and prevent money from being diverted into different channels. Of course, I am not referring here to the aid provided following disasters. I am excluding that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Equally, the critical approach to EU taxation has nothing to do with an apparent lack of solidarity. It is simply due to the fact that the Member States are largely opposed to it. For this reason, it is clear that we must retain the ratification by the national parliaments for the sake of subsidiarity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, we have not requested a single cent more than the Council had offered us. This means that we were completely in line with the Council’s wishes. On the subject of the flexibility instrument, we need it because the Council regularly gets us into difficulties with its decisions on major projects for which it has not made provision for the funding. We then have to attempt, together with the Member States, to find a solution for these projects, in order to be able to support them financially and to make sensible plans. We have also not demanded more than what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, we are calling for compliance with the treaty. Nothing else, nothing more and nothing less.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of own resources, it is surely not asking too much for Parliament to say that it would at least like to discuss the issue, what form it could take and whether own resources are in place.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, here is my brief supplement to what was introduced by President Barroso, after listening to the comments of the honourable Members.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strategy of the Commission in these specific circumstances is very simple and is based on the simple assumption that unity, not divisions, is what Europe needs to face other challenges. I think that the Belgian Presidency is acting on the same assumption.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our role is clearly defined in the treaties in the event of agreement – and in the event of disagreement, which was not very likely, but it has happened for the first time in 26 years. We see the frustration of millions of beneficiaries throughout the European Union. Therefore, we need to respond. We understand that we should move quickly and we have taken the first step today to agree on the guidelines, then, possibly on 1 December, to submit the figures, which are no longer controversial, to defend flexibility, which we need, to come up with a proposal on the arrangements for cooperation built on the Lisbon Treaty, and to defend – which is also important – the Commission’s right of initiative to present the vision of the future next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is our common responsibility to deliver what was promised, what is expected by the beneficiaries, what has been built up, as a budget, on the revenue side, while fully respecting the fiscal sovereignty of Member States. This is about a modest budget that was rising at half the rate of a national budget, despite the enlargement accommodating over 12 new states. This was clear proof of discipline and rigour. Therefore, let us carry out the job, while working for a better scenario. I am appealing to your sense of responsibility. Along with President Barroso, I feel very much encouraged by today’s debate in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is true that this type of debate should help us reach an agreement rather than make the situation even more difficult. I hope to be able to say that it is really in that spirit that we had this debate this afternoon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, there will be progress and we will have to try and find an agreement on flexibility and on financing ITER. Yes, this prospect for the 2012 and 2013 budgets will have to be subject to agreement and we are really striving to demonstrate that we have the ability to reach an agreement on this 2012-2013 prospect, particularly on the important issue of flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, yes, we will have debates within the context of Articles 312 and 324 in order to see how, in practice, we can implement and carry this out, and ensure that these articles and these new procedures become a reality. We will have to find common ground.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I heard that the Commission was going to use its power to initiate legislation, whether on the issue of own resources, or for the multiannual framework. On the basis of these elements, we will have to get together, we will have to discuss, we will have to make sure that we abide by Articles 312 and 324 of the treaty, which include provisions to the effect that all elements need to be implemented in order to reach an agreement, to have these meetings and to carry out this coordination which would enable these new procedures laid down by the treaty to become a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the flexible part for 2012-2013, we will have to implement these Articles 312 and 324 of the treaty, even if, once again – I must emphasise this point – we must ensure that the 2011 budget is passed. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. Also at stake is the effectiveness of the policies which will only be implemented if the 2011 budget is passed. We are only talking about the cohesion policies; that is all we are talking about. What is truly at stake here is our credibility and the implementation of our policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, let us not vindicate those who do not want a budget so that the EU has even fewer resources at its disposal to carry out its policies. However, in order to prove them wrong, undoubtedly we need to support a conciliatory approach and make the most of these last few weeks in order to achieve this approach so that we all benefit from it, despite having had to make concessions. Yet at least this is a rationale that entails moving forward rather than backwards, which would be the case if we do not have the 2011 budget in the next few weeks.</p>

Is it possible to move forward in our direction? We have certain expectations.

      <p sl="fr">Mr Schulz, I did hear your question. I believe no one has been spared.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that we can either choose the approach of pointing fingers at each other – your fault, our fault – or we can try and convince ourselves to take another approach, with both sides trying to make progress towards this conciliatory approach. We could also remain in the state of mind that unfortunately led to a disagreement on 15 November.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who is to blame? I could have told you that from the outset, Parliament was certainly going to say that the Council was to blame and the Council was certainly going to say that Parliament was to blame, while both would thank the Commission for having made efforts at conciliation. We must try to move away from that kind of approach and make the most of the last few weeks and days in order to start thinking along different lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To answer the President’s question, can any progress be made? Yes, progress can be made, because we know that if we act in the same way as we did on 15 November, we would only repeat the disagreement that occurred on 15 November, particularly on the important issue of flexibility. Why is this issue important? It is important because in my view, it addresses one of Parliament's major concerns which is to have a number of prospects, at least for 2012-2013, which is when the current multiannual framework ends.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the reason why, on this matter, the Belgian Presidency, following on from 15 November, immediately resumed contacts to try and make progress on these other points too. Yes, there are possibilities for agreement in this context, but both sides will have to reverse their rationale and embrace a conciliatory approach in order to achieve results. Otherwise, we will unfortunately witness another failure, and I previously touched on the harmful consequences that a failure would have, mainly on the implementation of our policies. I think that the citizens of Europe deserve better than that.</p>

This is an historic moment: will the Council, and particularly the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Denmark, allow themselves to see that Europe is all about pooling resources to do better together? Some Member States are adopting an inconsistent approach: they are cutting their national budgets in the name of restraint and calling on the EU to solve their problems by giving it ambitious tasks to fulfil. Then, just as these ambitions are about to be realised, they rebel against the voracious budgetary demands. Galileo, ITER, the EU 2020 strategy, the European External Action Service – they all cost money! Will we have to fight each year to obtain a token contribution from stubborn Member States that will subsequently accuse Europe of being ineffective and superfluous?

I, too, would stress that the European Parliament is not asking for an increase in expenditure or for more powers than those provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament is clearly arguing that the EU needs to have sufficient resources at its disposal to be able to smoothly implement policies which supplement efforts by the Member States to strengthen employment, investment and overall economic growth. Parliament’s position is that the EU budget does not form part of the crisis; it is – via investments in critical sectors – the answer to it.</p>

If the European Union has not adopted a budget by then and still needs to set one every month, it will be very difficult for our Presidency to discharge its duties. We must ask ourselves what is more important: an easy short-term solution, which means giving in to a number of countries and the Presidency, or a more ambitious plan, which may be more difficult but which, in the long term, will make the EU stronger and from which we really will all gain? In my opinion, it is more important for us to build a strong European Union together. A European Union of this kind needs its own resources and a strong budget based on the principle of solidarity in order to fund what is needed. There are several EU Member States, first and foremost the United Kingdom, which do not even wish to discuss this. We cannot afford to give in to national egoisms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today I have the honour of presenting the Commission work programme for 2011. The presentation marks a beginning and an end. On the one hand, the work programme intervenes and launches a new phase of very important political work. On the other hand, the adoption of the programme is the conclusion of the enhanced structured dialogue, which was opened with the State of the Union debate in September here in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The preparations leading to this year’s Commission work programme have indeed been a ‘première’, and, in my opinion, a very successful one. By advancing the implementation of our revised Framework Agreement, we have been able to engage in in-depth discussions on the political priorities for the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout this fruitful process, I have been encouraged by the large degree of convergence on the overall direction and on concrete initiatives. It is a process which has acted to consolidate what I have called ‘a special partnership’.</p>
      <p sl="en">European action must focus on those challenges where the EU can bring a tangible added value. The 40 strategic initiatives which the Commission commits to present in 2011 reflect the main political priorities that we have identified together. For the sake of transparency, the programme moreover includes 150 other proposals which the Commission is working on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sustaining economic recovery and securing our societies for the future remains the overarching priority in 2011. Our efforts will continue along three main tracks: strengthening governance, completing financial sector reform and accelerating our implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Long-term growth must be based on a sound macro-economic foundation. Through initiating the so-called ‘European semester’, and the follow-up to our proposals of 29 September, we will reinforce the European fiscal framework and broaden macro-economic surveillance to prevent imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">An ambitious financial sector reform is already well under way and important legislation has been accomplished. In 2011, the Commission will table the remaining pieces of regulation. Key priorities, such as transparency and consumer protection, will be pursued, while a bank crisis framework will aim to prevent and tackle future crises. The Commission will seek to support Parliament and the Council in reaching agreement on the complete reform before the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe must keep pace, focusing on our comparative advantages in this 21st century of globalisation. When competitors are cheaper, we must be smarter. As an example of action at European level, we will develop a more integrated European standardisation system as an important platform for sharpening the competitive edge of our companies, particularly SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">For Europe to remain competitive and secure more and better jobs, the transition to a low carbon, resource-efficient society must be carefully planned. Therefore, bringing together the policies on climate change, energy, transport and environment will be a priority. A particular focus in 2011 will be on energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Adapting to a dynamic economic reality also means ensuring a high level of protection of workers’ rights in close cooperation with social partners. Key proposals on posting of workers and working time will be developed and tabled in 2011. Meanwhile, the revision of the State aid rules applicable to services of general interest will be a tangible step towards establishing a quality framework which takes account of the particular nature of these services.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the Single Market Act, the Commission has launched an ambitious process to make the single market deliver on its full potential. Our companies should focus on business, not bureaucracy. Not least, SMEs are often overburdened or indeed discouraged from pursuing otherwise promising cross-border projects. As a concrete example, by clarifying the rules on collectively managed copyrights, we can simplify the current framework conditions, encourage further cross-border activity and release important job-creating potential – not least in the promising digital sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the demand side, a priority will be to strengthen consumer confidence with our proposal on alternative dispute resolution as an important instrument to speed up the often much too slow process of resolving consumer problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whether we act as consumers, as workers, as students, as travellers or in any other of the multiple roles we fulfil in modern, everyday life, it is when we experience new opportunities, a reduction in risks, or improvements in the quality of life, that the European Union makes sense. This is a European Union at the service of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ambition of making the EU a tangible reality for citizens must go beyond the single market. Strengthening security should always be a means of helping citizens to benefit from the opportunities of the European Union, never an end in itself. Our proposal for ‘smart borders’ will facilitate travelling in and out of the EU while deterring irregular immigration. To keep Europe open, we will also take action against those that try to exploit our economic system for illegal purposes, while the framework for data protection will respond to a very real concern of citizens in the Internet Age. The Union must play a role in the world that matches its economic weight, so we must ensure coherence in our external action.</p>
      <p sl="en">As such, the work programme announces concrete action to project our 2020 objectives for jobs and growths internationally. We will also modernise our development policy and humanitarian aid. Those in the world in need really need a stronger Europe in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before concluding, I would like to briefly explain what you will not find in the Commission work programme and why.</p>
      <p sl="en">As announced, we will submit the proposal for the next multiannual financial framework by mid-2011. The specific financial instruments and programmes will be presented in the second half of 2011 in conjunction with the overall framework. To maintain the political nature of the work programme, implementation work as a rule has not been included. The same applies for international negotiations, as their conclusion depends on third parties. Meanwhile, these activities remain an important part of our core business. We will continue to deliver and to pursue our dialogue with you on them.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my introduction, I noted that the work programme was not only the conclusion of our fruitful dialogue, but also the beginning of a next step in our concrete efforts to steer the European Union out of the crisis and beyond. Now is the time to maintain momentum. We need to find ways to collectively accelerate our work.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore take this opportunity to encourage Parliament and the Council to engage in trilateral discussions on how to implement the treaty provisions on Union programming. In the Commission’s view, this could translate into agreements to move forward quicker in negotiations on selected initiatives of particular importance to attaining our political objectives. Such a concerted effort would demonstrate our determination to deliver concrete, timely responses in the face of the crisis which has shaken us all. Europe’s citizens would expect this. I believe the European Union institutions should respond to citizens’ concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must overcome the crisis. Europe’s economy must be founded on work. We must steer the countries of the European Union out of the current grave crisis by concentrating, as our main priority, on providing work opportunities to as many European citizens as possible. For this reason, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports job creation as the most important objective of the European Commission’s work programme for next year.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Europe has learnt much from the crisis. This year, we have embarked on the development of a new economic governance system in an accelerated procedure and hope that Parliament can debate the new proposals related to financial regulation and economic governance next year in a way that ensures their adoption as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">My PPE colleagues will raise important issues for each area, and I would like to mention only a few: competitiveness must be based on innovation and research. We believe that there are not enough initiatives concerning this area in the Commission’s work programme. There is a need for the increased protection of intellectual property rights and a viable competitive European patent system, as well. We believe that the increased control of European food imports is important and that they should be subject to at least the quality requirement that the European Union expects of its own producers. We would also have liked to have seen more proposals concerning the water issue set by the Hungarian Presidency as one of the major objectives.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, based on the Treaty of Lisbon, a new order of the European Union’s legislative and work programme began in September this year with Mr Barroso’s speech on the State of the Union. Since the new treaty guarantees Parliament strong rights to intervene in the European Union’s programme, we believe that further measures are important. Unfortunately, previous experiences are not good. The Commission’s earlier work programmes were only partially realised according to plan. As I have already mentioned several times, I question, together with a number of my fellow Members, the point of wasting immense energy and time on many occasions each year analysing and adopting a document which, in any event, only covers the reality in part. For this reason, I would like to suggest that Parliament’s competent committee regularly examines the implementation of the Commission’s work programme in the course of the year as well, in order to better enforce the influence of the citizens we represent on the EU’s joint affairs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Šefčovič, I believe that we can support much of the content of this programme, Mr Barroso. However, you will, I am sure, understand if we look at the more critical points today, where we want to see more being done. We live in a Europe which is increasingly under the influence of anti-European forces that are fighting against the institutions of the European Union. We need to consider carefully what materials and methods we can use to oppose them. I will come back to this point later on.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first issue is growth policy. Mr Barroso, it is right that we must regulate the financial markets and put safety nets in place. However, we must also somehow return to the situation that you have often clearly described, in other words, to what we understand by green growth or green jobs and the restructuring of the economy. Mr Oettinger has recently published a series of documents on energy policy which involved huge investments. Unfortunately, the documents do not explain how these investments are to be financed. We must emerge from this crisis with an active growth policy in place. I am wondering where in the energy sector or the transport sector, for example, investments of this kind can be made in order to bring about green growth or create green jobs. We simply do not have enough.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the internal market. You are right, Mr Barroso. The concept of the internal market must be made public. You have proposed several reports based on Professor Monti’s work. He was very critical of the social dimension of the internal market in particular. More needs to happen in this area. Most importantly, we are waiting for concrete proposals from you concerning the Posting of Workers Directive. We must make it clear in the interests of the workers that this directive must not be used to create cheap labour. Its purpose is to improve social welfare.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point relates to tax policy. We believe that the proposals made in this area are too weak. As we have just seen in the debate on Ireland, certain countries must not be allowed to set lower tax rates in order to attract businesses and then, when they get into financial difficulties, to call on other countries to finance their budget deficits, if I can put this in such a simplistic way. Tax harmonisation is necessary to a certain degree, for example, minimum rates of corporation tax. I believe that we need to make progress in this area. I know that you have difficulties with many Member States, but I believe it is essential, in particular, when it comes to social issues. The divide between rich and poor is unacceptable and we must introduce new proposals, particularly in the interests of women, who are especially hard hit by poverty.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, you have spoken about citizens’ concerns, Mr Barroso. This is a very important issue. However, the way in which we present what we do – and this concerns you as well as Parliament – is also important. Many people do not realise that, in the case of a large number of issues, all that we do is to issue incomprehensible press releases about our work. We must work together to explain what we do more effectively. The citizens’ initiative will soon be starting. Its opponents will exploit it and use it against Europe. We must make sure that the citizens’ initiative helps to support and develop Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, times are hard for the European economy and for the European project as a whole. We have been devising big strategies such as the climate package, the energy package and the 2020 strategy: schemes after schemes. We still do not seem to know where we want to go and what we want to be.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why am I saying this? Because wanting to be the best is not sufficient to be the best. The reality is that we are adopting strategies we do not all believe in. No one – or almost no one – is implementing them and no one is ready to finance them.</p>
      <p sl="de">It seems we have too many strategies and a lack of interest in making them a reality. And this is why I believe it is time to get back to the basics of what made the European project possible and brought us together: simple natural things. The single market should be our big scheme and we should put all our effort into enforcing it, because if we want to be competitive on the world stage, we need more economic integration. The only reasonable way to achieve this is through the single market.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the Commission work programme, and specifically your proposal on the Single Market Act. But that is not enough. You have the monetary report. You know what is needed – to encourage investment, attract capital and boldly cut bureaucratic expenses. We should focus on simple things which have an obvious impact on Europe’s competitiveness, such as resource efficiency, cutting energy costs, reforming the agriculture policy, and the future of transport.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission and Parliament must work hand in hand and ensure that these means match our will. We are therefore looking forward to an ambitious multiannual financial framework proposal in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="de">Do we need more regulation to tackle the financial crisis? Yes, but only if the aim is to foster Europe’s competitiveness. In any case, we should avoid adopting an autistic response to the crisis, hoping that the rest of the world will follow.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the message we are sending to our citizens and to the world is not that the EU is a pragmatic association of ideas, capital and values, we will not become the global player we want to be. Instead of influencing policies in the world, we will be affected by them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now a word on the European Semester. The Commission is best placed to identify our strengths and weaknesses when planning work. But you should be careful, because what you are proposing to EU citizens and Member States is that they should believe that Brussels knows better, and that politicians in Brussels are closer to the citizen’ interests than an MP from their constituency. It is a difficult job, and you will commit to this through policy coordination in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope you will succeed in proving this, in boosting growth and jobs – not for some, but for all. Otherwise, we will witness the rise of real anti-Europeanism.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wish you good luck.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, it is important to make it clear that we cannot discuss this work programme without considering the current budget debate and without thinking about Greece, Ireland and other countries which may get into difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, I would like to say that, at the end of the budget debate, I heard that you, Mr Barroso, took a very open approach to Parliament’s positions. I believe that it is genuinely important to be honest when we adopt a work programme of this kind and not to behave as if we could achieve and implement all these wonderful objectives without a reliable budget that does not need to be constantly renegotiated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the discussions about Ireland have shown how far we are from reaching a real solution and a way out of the crisis that we have got ourselves into because we were too liberal with regard to the financial markets. On behalf of my group, I would like to say that your proposals as to how we will overcome the financial crisis and how we will find escape routes contain a few good starting points, but we do not believe that the objective you have set yourself is sufficiently challenging.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look back at the time we have already spent discussing a successful, functioning monetary union within the European Union and if we want to guarantee that we are really taking a step towards economic governance for Europe, it becomes clear that we must not abandon this now.</p>
      <p sl="de">We feel that your proposal lacks a positive focus on establishing a common economic policy after the end of the crisis, rather than just tackling the symptoms, and we will continue to work on this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Swoboda has already mentioned green issues. I am not satisfied with how the description of sustainable, fair and green growth from the Europe 2020 strategy has been represented in this work programme. This is not what we discussed in the context of Europe 2020 and it is relevant that Mr Oettinger is one of the Commissioners who are moving further and further away from the idea of rebuilding Europe in a sustainable form.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, next year will be a test for the European institutions as to whether they can support the current economic recovery and enable long-term growth through their policies. The European Commission work programme is a key document in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="cs">However, I would like to say at this point that less legislation can sometimes mean more. I am therefore concerned, for example, about the planned regulatory activities of the Commission in the area of concessions on services. In this particular case, it has to be said that the area of concessions is now explicitly excluded from the framework of public procurement, which has also been confirmed in many rulings from the European Court of Justice. Radical changes would definitely not benefit this area. Persons involved in the economy, including those from the public administration side, are worst affected when conditions they have learned to work with constantly change, and they therefore lack certainty as regards their decision making. All policies must therefore be adopted a considerable time in advance, so that we can give everyone enough time to prepare during the implementation phase.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Commission’s reasoning seems to be permanently oblivious to the serious crisis in Europe. You even write in your document, I quote: ‘The signs of recovery are clear’. Where are these signs of recovery for those who are currently unemployed, living in poverty or homeless?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Are you aware that we lent over EUR 400 billion of public money to rescue the banks and that this figure is precisely the amount of savings that will have been imposed on the people of the eight countries that are under the austerity plan? Your choices are therefore ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the Commission’s programme, I suggest carrying out an assessment of the effects the implementation of the Treaties of Maastricht and Lisbon has had on European workers and citizens. In my opinion, the solution is not austerity in wages or budgets. Instead, it should be structured around the increase of remuneration from work, improved social protection and solidarity-based pay-as-you-go pension schemes, as well as a contribution of capital income to public finances, thereby establishing a new fiscal justice. In fact, why not launch studies straight away into the creation of a tax on capital movements, setting up another credit with a new role for the European Central Bank, which, by means of money creation and another credit, should help Member States to refinance banks for safeguarding work, for education, for training, for all the common public assets with new public services for research and innovation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, since creation of jobs is one of the priorities in the programme we have, I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to a new era of emigration from southern Europe. But I am afraid nobody in the Commission is listening to me. Already in Greece, we are seeing huge numbers of young skilled and highly skilled workers emigrate to Australia, Canada and the Emirates. The same thing is happening in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">On one hand, Germany has announced that it has a skilled labour shortage. What I would like to say is that Germany does not have to import skilled labour from third countries. Member States that face economic problems could provide skilled labour to Germany. I would very much like to propose an initiative, to be taken up with the Commission, developing the notion of added value. Why not adopt a labour market with European added value? Within the Member States, we have to face supply and demand. We have to strengthen Europe with a European skilled labour force. This is missing in the programme and I strongly propose it.</p>

I would like to ask the Commission to look more boldly and less anxiously to the future. You have the necessary support from Parliament, while the Council, in particular, plays more of a restraining role. The progressive forces must stick together in this case. Competitiveness is one of the central issues that we need to deal with, to ensure that Europe remains competitive and that we can achieve our objectives, such as sustainable growth and social growth. It is also important that we convey this message correctly. Unfortunately, the anti-European forces have a much greater presence, particularly in the media, than the pro-European forces. However, everyone is aware that Europe can only move forward jointly in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must call on the Commission to focus in its overall programme during the next few years on increasing efficiency in the field of energy, in the use of resources and raw materials, and in education. Universities and schools must make a contribution to creating a smart Europe. The field of research and development faces particular challenges in this respect. We need to be aware that the rest of the world is not sleeping. We must not look with anxiety to the future and continue with our parochial approach, as is happening to a certain extent in the Council.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I believe that in this turbulent period we are going through, it cannot have been easy for the Commission to draw up such an ambitious plan, and I would therefore like to begin by offering you my congratulations. Despite that, I do have some comments to make.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The key word of the programme is economic recovery after the crisis, and intelligent, sustainable and inclusive recovery. I would like to say, Mr Vice-President, that I am rather sceptical about this. In the first place, I believe it is rather premature to talk about a recovery, because, even though there are certain indications, it is still not at all certain that there will be a recovery, and I think we cannot allow ourselves further doubts.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Moreover, I believe that in many states, the Commission is supporting policies which make recovery rather unlikely. Examples of this might include Latvia, Greece and recently also Ireland. While it is true that the debt burden is often too high, through restrictive economic policies, we will sooner find that there is no return to growth and that the actual debt burden has increased further.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I see the attempt to assert budget discipline through introducing more stringent Europe-wide regulations in a similar light. Such measures are counterproductive in a crisis. In addition, budget discipline will not resolve structural imbalances in the economies of the EU, such as trade surpluses and deficits, for example. However, I think this belongs to a longer discussion.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Where I really do support the efforts of the European Commission is in the regulation of the financial sector. I am not quite sure whether the measures proposed and adopted are sufficient, but in principle, they clearly mark a step in the right direction. The effort for intelligent and sustainable growth is also praiseworthy, and I understand that the programme cannot go fully into the details, but we do now need much more ambitious formulations and measures in the fight against poverty and the fight for social inclusion.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in this time of crisis, in which we find ourselves, there are two main types of policies and actions: preventive policies and actions and stimulative policies and actions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Preventive policies are those that currently concern the supervision of financial services, governance and strengthening governance. In other words, anything that is going to alert us to the fact that there are problems before the problems overwhelm the European economies.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the second type of policies – stimulative policies – are essential. There are three fundamental aspects of these policies, Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet. Naturally, there are more, but I am going to highlight three: research and innovation, the development of a digital society – in other words, the digital agenda – and the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first, research and innovation, is where I find the work programme presented by the Commission to be lacking.</p>
      <p sl="es">President Barroso said earlier that the specific programmes will come in mid-2011, but I do not think that is enough.

It is a way of attracting the attention of European citizens and of signposting to the European Commission areas in which it can be supported by the members of this House.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I will dwell on a few specific topics. The coming year will be especially important for the presence of the EU on the global stage. Externally, we should see an increasingly more effective European External Action Service, which cannot gain strength without the support of the European Commission as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="bg">As far as enlargement policy is concerned, we would like the Commission to make use of the new energy generated in 2010. We are calling on the Commission to help Croatia to meet the remaining requirements to bring accession negotiations to as early a successful conclusion as possible in 2011. As far as the progress of Chapter 23 is of particular importance to us, we expect the Commission to report to Parliament on how the talks have progressed in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The other candidate state, which the Commission must monitor with particular attention, is Turkey. We expect Turkey to be encouraged to speed up fulfilment of its undertakings in the negotiations process after the 2011 elections and to start work on a new constitution with particular emphasis on fundamental citizens’ rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We also urge the Commission to regularly inform the European Parliament on the position drafting process for Serbia’s application for EU membership.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We hope that the European neighbourhood policy review concludes with a proposal for appropriate corrections ensuring coherence between policy aims and financial instruments which guarantee these aims.

      <p sl="de">With regard to the internal market, an area which I am responsible for, I would like to say in particular that we want to ensure, on the basis of the paper produced by Professor Monti, that all the citizens of Europe can gain more benefits from the internal market. When we discuss the Commission’s work programme and when we take the Monti report as our foundation, this means, of course, firstly that the Commission must tackle the requirements of this paper, in other words, it must ensure that the infringement proceedings taken by the Commission against the Member States are strengthened to enable the transposition deficit to be reduced from 1% to 0.5%. Unfortunately, there is nothing about this in the work programme. Alongside the individual measures which are addressed in this report, such as the digital agenda, mortgage credit, concessions and many others which I will not refer to individually, we believe that it is important in every case that the measures which are announced for 2011 are actually presented in 2011. The additional information about the fact that the Commission is evaluating certain legislative plans does not help in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have made major progress on behalf of the citizens of Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, because we have included the social market economy among the principles of European policy. It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality. Now we are looking at the internal market itself and the issues relating to the internal market as a whole and we can see that some of the things which should have been included have been omitted.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not enough to carry out social impact assessments of European legislation. We need a social clause to be put into practice, so that the promises which were made that the citizens would really benefit from Europe are fulfilled and do not simply remain on paper. This is not just about the social clause, but also about important issues such as the services of general economic interest, which require special protection. It is very important to me that the European Commission finally addresses this question and looks more closely at issues concerning workers than was necessary, for example, in the context of the Posting of Workers Directive, where we are still waiting to find out what will happen next.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, and now I am slowly starting to get really annoyed, we have been calling on the European Commission for a long time to introduce a system for class actions at a European level. The Commission has already carried out six or seven different studies. What do we find now in this work programme? Another study has been commissioned. We cannot go on like this.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to emphasise two points in your programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, strengthening economic governance and initiating the European Semester. We were pleased to welcome the package on economic governance. Achieving this target is critical. In this respect, our group would like to see effective and binding measures that go further than what is being proposed. It is also necessary for Parliament to be truly involved in finalising the processes envisaged and in their implementation. Legal bases should be found to prevent the treaties from being substantially amended, which would only slow down the implementation of measures that must be taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point concerns the continuation of the work on financial regulation. The projects are on the table, or will be soon. 2011 will be a decisive year. We appreciate Commissioner Barnier’s pro-activeness. In 2010, Parliament showed its determination in adopting the supervision package, the directive on alternative investment fund managers and, in all likelihood by the end of the year, the regulation that will set up the European supervision of credit rating agencies. We want to continue on the path of a pragmatic, intelligent and effective regulation. That is what we are expecting from the Commission today.</p>

    <intervention id="2-479" speaker_id="1289" name="Proinsias De Rossa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, President Barroso talked in his introduction about introducing some measures on posting of workers. He was not specific on this, but I would remind him that he made a very specific commitment in the hearings, before he was reappointed as President, to revise the Posting of Workers Directive, so that social dumping would be prevented as a result of its operation and the court cases that arose from it. I would like to remind him of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could I also make the point that it is extremely essential that we introduce legislation to provide legal certainty for those in the Member States who provide social services of general interest? There seems to be a complete blindness on the part of the Commission with regard to the problems that exist in that area. I am working on a report on that at the moment and I will come back to this early next year. I also welcome the poverty platform, but I have no evidence at all that the Commission is using the 2020 strategy on which the platform is based, for instance, in the current negotiations with the Irish Government about resolving the problems there.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the 2020 strategy is not the framework for those negotiations, what is the framework? What is the European contribution to resolving the difficulties in Ireland, other than resolving the issues of the banks?</p>
      <p sl="en">Could I just make one final point? I think it is entirely putting the cart before the horse for any Member of this Parliament to talk here about establishing a minimum corporation profits tax across the European Union without also talking about a common fiscal policy, without also having a budget strong enough to provide the cohesion necessary for weak and peripheral states, and a whole range of other European policies that need to be put in place before we can seriously talk about a corporation tax being the same right across the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I consider the work programme tabled before us to be encouraging and I especially welcome the fact that soon, we will be able to start a debate on the flagship initiative under the cover name ‘new skill, new job’.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to make some political and some professional comments. I think it is important that we start consultations in good time and that the Commission takes into consideration not only the agenda suggested by the Council but also the agendas adapting to the needs of Parliament. I believe it is important, as others have said, that existing financial resources should back projects and priorities and, at the same time, I consider it important that the adopted programmes should be followed by tracking and monitoring as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Some problems: education. We agree with raising educational and training standards, but regret the fact that legislative benefits for occupational diseases are absent. I wish to emphasise and remind the Commission that we support more efficient implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive, but oppose all kinds of new directives.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We believe that the Social Fund, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the European Regional Fund must be used in a synergic manner, with special emphasis on the main priority that is needed to link these programmes, namely job creation and expansion of employment. One final remark: the administrative burdens that weigh heavily on economic actors and, in particular, on small and medium-sized enterprises, must be eliminated, and this must apply to European programmes and European funding initiatives as well.</p>

    <intervention id="2-481" speaker_id="28155" name="Edit Herczog" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I will try to be very brief. I wish to thank the Commission for this work programme, which must have been very difficult to prepare as the budget is not available to us. I, too, wish to mention the points which we would have liked to have included, but were missing. We would have liked a legislative proposal to be tabled on the long-awaited industrial policy, and likewise there should have been a step forward with the raw materials policy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We would have been pleased to see proposals of a more concrete nature in the Commission’s work programme as regards energy efficiency and energy projects. We very much regret the fact that the semi-annual evaluation of the research and development framework programme will not take place and wish to stress most emphatically that if agreement can be reached in the budget about the Galileo and ITER programmes, we will be able to return to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We would very much welcome a more efficient implementation of the small enterprise policy, which will soon celebrate its second birthday. Likewise, we would be glad if this year, when we will have two semesters of successive new Member State presidencies, namely from Hungary and Poland, cohesion and integration within the EU could continue.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The gap between the eastern and western halves of the European Union, which is visible, for instance, in wages and in other respects, is unacceptable. It would certainly be worthwhile to make progress here. Finally, we would be very pleased if we could move forward with the Eastern Partnership, which is very important in terms of energy security. This is true even if there are people even in Parliament who try to hinder it, for example, in connection with Euronest.</p>

    <intervention id="2-482" speaker_id="1129" name="Catherine Trautmann" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, this work programme presents the recovery of growth and jobs, as well as economic regulation, as key to restoring confidence. That is true. Our model of economic development can no longer make do with strengthening the enforcement aspect of a Stability Pact that has continually shown its limitations. The recovery of growth must be centred on job creation throughout the Union in its entirety. We need to look at employment and social standards as indicators of economic power and, from that point of view, emphasise the need to put more thought into the European tax on financial transactions and into a greater coordination between the European Union and the European ministers for employment, as well as into the Union’s economic proposals. I support the Members who took the floor to highlight the importance of the directive on the posting of workers and on the services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that the European Union’s digital strategy is a crucial factor for this new economy. We should show more recognition of the Commission’s ambition on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to citizenship, the Union should put the citizens back at the heart of the European project, and the increase in financial allocations should not only focus on security aspects, in particular, on managing migratory flows.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would end, Mr President, by saying that, in essence, this work programme for 2011 should be the very example of a policy that addresses in a positive way this temptation for nations to withdraw, which all our Member States are experiencing. I believe the European Commission has the power to change things. It can rely on a Parliament which will be a proactive force and will support it if it shows more ambition.</p>

    <intervention id="2-483" speaker_id="1263" name="Elmar Brok" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to make three brief points. Firstly, I believe, with regard to external relations, that the Commission, which has a particular responsibility in this area, should take a more conceptual approach to the Eastern Partnership than it has done in the past and should call for a multilateral relationship between the members of the partnership. In particular, we should carry out a much more effective evaluation of the Eastern Partnership in our own interest, not only from an energy perspective, and we should make this one of our priorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I do not know what the situation is with structural funds in other areas, but the process for the financial management of the programmes for external relations is unbearably slow. By the time the money is made available, the political objective is already a year old. We have seen this in the case of the Middle East programmes, the Eastern Partnership and in many other areas. I know that this also has to do with Parliament and the Financial Regulation of the European Union and that it causes so many problems as a result of the procedures which we had under the Santer Commission 10 years ago. However, if we really want to put all this money to good use and to ensure that it does not just have a deadweight effect or always arrive too late, because the train has already departed in the other direction, and to promote our own policy interests, we need some good ideas from the Commission as to how decisions on the establishment and implementation of programmes and payments of money in these areas can be made much more quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point, Mr Barroso, is that the question of the Transatlantic Economic Council and the economic relationship with the USA, and not only its economic significance but also its strategic importance, seem to me not to be covered in sufficient detail in the Commission’s paper.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Europe’s citizens expect that in 2011, European institutions will focus on creating new jobs and on social Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I wish to express my dismay that you have postponed the White Paper on the future of European transport until 2011. This document is vital to both the future financial outlook and the future of the cohesion policy, which we have already begun to discuss.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to highlight from the work programme for 2011 the importance of the legislative initiatives in the following areas: personal data protection, improvement of information and network security based on public procurement standards and recommendations, electronic signatures and reciprocal recognition of electronic identification and authentication mechanisms. These initiatives are absolutely imperative for implementing the digital agenda and achieving the internal market, including in the services sector.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are also anticipating with interest the legislative initiative on smart energy networks. These networks are necessary both to make it possible to obtain electricity generated from renewable energy resources, in which Member States have made huge investments in recent years, and to prepare the necessary infrastructure for electric vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I will say by way of conclusion that the digital agenda and energy efficiency, which are areas that contribute to both job creation and the European Union’s competitiveness, should be, along with social Europe, our main priorities for 2011.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Commission has put forward an incredibly wide-ranging programme for 2011 and I would like to make it quite clear that I think it would be good if the prioritisation were improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now have around 30 Directorates-General and 26 Commissioners. I do not believe that every Directorate-General and every Commissioner should have to justify their existence by producing large numbers of legislative proposals. I am convinced that it would sometimes be good for Europe if we were to set genuine priorities and restrict ourselves to the essentials. Europe’s strength lies not in concerning itself with as many issues as possible, but in taking more time for important questions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make some points relating to external trade in particular, as I am the coordinator for my group in this area. I would be pleased if we could at last make some progress with the transatlantic relationship, as Elmar Brok has already said. The Transatlantic Economic Council has been on the agenda for years, but has not yet had any real successes. If we look at how the world has changed during this time and how the economic power of different regions in the world has shifted, we can see that we urgently need to work much more closely with the Americans.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would be good if the Commission could remember during the course of its work that the European Parliament is a colegislator in the field of external trade since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Both sides, Parliament and the Commission, will have to learn how to deal with one another and how to draw up legislation jointly, with regard to external trade in particular. I would be very happy if the Commission were to pay special attention to this area and, most importantly, to allow plenty of time for the dialogue and for transparent, joint activities.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, firstly, I welcome the work done by the Commission to advance this agenda. The European Union is making every effort to end this economic crisis. However, despite the amount of work done and the amount still to be done, we cannot forget the people in the developing world.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Mr President, as the joint PPE coordinator on the Development Committee, may I say that it is absolutely shocking to understand that, after we agreed to meet a commitment of 0.7% of GNP to assist the developing world, that budget is the first budget – or is certainly in the front line – to be cut every time there is financial retrenchment in our Member States. I understand – we all understand – that when GNI goes down, the contribution will go down, but it should not go down as a percentage of GNI and then go down again.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I ask the Commission to do everything in its power, so soon after the Millennium Development Review in New York, to ensure that Member States face up to their commitment. We are not asking them not to reduce their contributions. We are asking that they do not reduce their contributions as a percentage of their reduced GNI.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, briefly, I just wanted to say that, due to the economic times we are currently living through, it is easy and natural to focus simply on the economic aspect. Europe, however, is not solely made up of the European market but of the European citizen, too. Therefore, we must push ahead with the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, because it is the Stockholm Programme, on which we have just reached agreement, that will lead us to create a Europe for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="mt">In more concrete terms, what we need for next year is further development to counter terrorism and ensure general security for our citizens, because our citizens are demanding more security from the European Union. We must also strengthen our fight against organised crime, especially in the area of corruption. Furthermore, we need to reinforce our citizens’ rights in, for example, the protection of victims of crime. Finally, we need to create a single common asylum and immigration policy that is based on the principle of solidarity. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, the work programme for 2011 presented by the European Commission really does seem rather ambitious. I hope that this document becomes a founding document for the future – a more competitive, more united and more prosperous European future.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Nevertheless, in the past, there were many ambitious documents and plans, not all of which were implemented. I remember well how, a few years ago, those countries that are now experiencing a huge financial crisis were held up as an example of how to conduct financial and economic policy. Today, however, life has brought massive changes.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I therefore entirely support greater monitoring of the financial market, the creation of a common energy market and the development of principles to integrate countries into our economy to a greater extent. Only then will we be able to ensure in future that the European Union is more competitive, and that our people will be better provided for in terms of jobs and incomes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, reading the Commission work programme for 2011, one principal point stands out: use of the crisis to grab power for the Commission. Coordination of economic and fiscal policies, broader and enhanced surveillance of fiscal policies, better coordination of macro-economic policy and, more chillingly, new enforcement mechanisms. We have heard that this will produce smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, but if we look at the Commission’s Europe 2020 document, it is disarmingly frank: 23 million unemployed, 4% fall in GDP in 2009. As long as we embrace globalism, we shall not dig ourselves out of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2020 document refers to Member States being the most innovative in the world, but if emerging low wage economies are able to steal inventions with impunity, innovation will not help us. We must protect our economies from piratical and slave-labour economies. 2020 refers to the people of Europe as talented and creative; perhaps we should follow demographic policies that foster those talents and protect and preserve that creativity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Commission work programme is ambitious, but I think there is one thing missing – I would like the Commission to place greater emphasis on the implementation of rules, laws, strategies and policies which are already in existence. We are creating more strategies and drafting new documents, but very many things are simply not being put into effect, particularly in the field of energy. Therefore, I think this should be a separate, special item in the Commission’s work. If the Commission does not make sure that laws which have already been passed are put into effect, it will simply not be very credible and will lose its legitimacy. This is also how we allowed major financial problems to occur in Europe – when we did not observe the Maastricht criteria. Many countries slowly began to ignore them or violate them, and now we have very great problems. Yes, this may be rather unimpressive, it may not look very good on paper, but I think it is crucial for the work of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, although the Commission planned to revive job creation as soon as possible, in the area of employment and social affairs, the Commission work programme for 2011 sadly does not contain specific proposals on the creation of new and good quality jobs. Again, the Commission proposes the same legislative initiatives on the posting of workers and working time as it did in the work programme for the previous year, and pledges to improve the rights of migrant workers throughout the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, that really is not enough. We are having a thorough debate on the future of pensions in the European Union and one of the proposals is to increase the retirement age, but the Commission has not provided specific proposals on the employment of elderly people. Secondly, under the conditions of the economic and financial crisis, illegal work and the shadow economy have grown significantly. There really is a lack of concrete proposals on how we should combat this malady together.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Thirdly, in order to overcome poverty and really reduce the number of people living in poverty in the European Union, I truly hope that the Commission will introduce a directive on minimum income as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, when drawing up the work programme, continuation is always assumed on the one hand, and changes are assumed on the other. In what proportions, and what will the relationship be between them in 2011? Without doubt, work related to exiting the crisis, improving economic growth and creating jobs should be continued. Our objectives for 2011 have, therefore, been established. The number of strategies which we have adopted is sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, we have to change the depth of reforms related to economic governance. This can be seen in the Monti report in the area of essential measures for the single market. We must act similarly in the reform of financial institutions and their supervision. 2011 should be a year of implementing measures which have been adopted and a year when the new agencies commence operation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An improvement in competitiveness can occur mainly by a growth in efficiency, with the use of innovative and modern methods. Finally, a further important task is work on the objectives and the multiannual financial frameworks for 2014-2020.

Much is said there, but I would rather inquire into what is not said, or not fully said. Specifically, how does the Commission want to prioritise the accelerated adoption of urgent proposals? I place the emphasis on accelerated adoption. We all know what a lengthy business European legislation is.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would also like to ask – the programme ends by emphasising cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their positive and kind words concerning the Commission’s work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you look through your interventions, you will see that there is a considerable convergence in the goals we would like to achieve together. I think it is because the Commission’s work programme was, to a great extent, our joint endeavour. The structural dialogue we introduced this year, the intense communication between the committees and the Commissioners really paid off. We ended up with a Commission work programme that contains the converging aims between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of you highlighted the importance of focusing on appropriate implementation, so that our programmes and proposals would not simply stay on paper. I absolutely understand this request and, therefore, we also included in the Commission’s work programme monitoring of the ongoing work. I will be very happy to come to Parliament on a regular basis and to brief you on how we are progressing and implementing the Commission’s work programme so we can have a debate, not just once a year but on a regular basis, about how we are progressing with the fulfilment of the Commission’s work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">So far this year, out of the 34 initiatives we promised for this year, we will definitely fulfil 30. This is relatively good progress but, of course, we will be ready to discuss this issue further with you and to keep you informed on a regular basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also very glad that you urge us to do more, not less, with some exceptions. This is, of course, a very welcome tendency from Parliament towards the Commission. I agree with all of you who say that we need to do better. We have not only to perform well to fulfil our goals, but we need to show that with high quality work, we can use the result as the best counter-argument and best instrument to tackle Euroscepticism in Europe and the ghosts of the past, which always emerge when we face tough times: protectionism, racism, xenophobia and many of the phenomena you have just described here. With good work and good cooperation, we can tackle these ghosts of the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that we need a lot of investment in infrastructure, but we are also absolutely sure that we need modern infrastructure. If we want to compete on a global level and to preserve our competitive edge, it is very clear that we need to upgrade our infrastructure. It is not only important for our economic goals, but it is also important for the greening of our economies and for resource-efficient economies to be developed. For that, we need to use, more than ever, the project-oriented EU bonds, we need to engage more with the EIB and we need to find ways to use public-private partnerships more in the future. You will also find this in our programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the single market, I welcome all the remarks and the focus on the single market, because this is really the EU’s main crown jewel. We have achieved a lot with the single market and we know that we can achieve even more if we can release the potential of the single market. We need to get rid of the barriers to the single market that still remain, we need to get rid of bottlenecks and we need to use the new areas of the economy. Some of you referred to the digital economy and how much we could improve life in Europe if we used more e-services, e-government or e-commerce, and these are new areas in which we have to engage more.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mario Monti presented an excellent report and Michel Barnier used this report as a basis for our range of proposals. We started the debate on how to make the European single market better, more open and more competitive, so that it brings us even better results than we have today. So let us participate and look at which of the proposals Michel Barnier put on the table could be the most important ones and which proposals should have higher priority. I believe that together, we will achieve a better and stronger single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the administrative burden, as you know, Günter Verheugen included in the programme a reduction in the administrative burden by 25% before 2012. I am very happy to tell you that the Commission is working very hard so that this limit will be passed. Now, we are aiming to reach the level of 30%, but we also need to be very clear that it is not only the Commission that can deliver results. Very often, the administrative burden increases at national level when they are implementing European legislation with different kinds of strings attached. We need to work on this issue from both levels, from a European level and also from a national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the importance of the social dimension of the European single market, I absolutely agree with you. We learned the lessons of the past and we will be coming with proposals on posted workers, on a time directive and also on the services of general interest, which would reflect this very important social dimension, because we know that the single market will work only when it is embraced by the citizens. Therefore, we need to include this very solid social impact assessment in the proposals we make so we know that the proposals we will be bringing to citizens will be accepted and supported by them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Tzavela made a very passionate plea related to the potential brain drain, that we are losing young well-educated Europeans who go to work elsewhere outside the European Union. Sometimes it is because of remaining barriers on the labour market in Europe, sometimes it is because of a lack of information, but often it is also because our education does not match the needs of European businesses. Therefore, I am very glad that in a few moments, you will start the discussion on the new flagship initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see that my colleagues, Commissioner Vassiliou and Commissioner Andor, are here. They will explain how we would like to do it better, how to match the skills with the needs in such a way that young people will not be unemployed but will bring their potential to the European economy, and we will all benefit from that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of you highlighted the importance of the regulation of financial markets and the importance of fast decision making and how we should achieve it. We have already highlighted that, in future, we need to progress with better coordination between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. We would like to do it in a new form of Union programming, where we will decide on the priorities, the timing and the deadlines, so we can deliver the results faster and can accelerate the legislative process even at a faster pace than today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that, as regards the multiannual financial framework, we will do our utmost to bring an ambitious project to you. We need your help in explaining at all levels – to the media, to national audiences – the proportions of this debate, how much we in Europe can achieve with just 1% of GDP, the structure of the European budget with almost 95% of this budget going back to national economies with high value-added from the European Union. This debate must also be taken to the national capitals and we need to talk to citizens, to inform them about how this budget is structured so we can gain strong support for our ambitious proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Elmar Brok referred to very important areas in external relations – the Eastern Partnership, the enlargement process – where we also need to work for credibility on both sides. We must be very credible in how we negotiate and monitor the criteria that are fulfilled by the candidate countries, but we must also be credible in what we are offering to candidates so that we have trust built on both sides.</p>
      <p sl="en">The United States is a very important partner and, if we manage to get rid of some of the barriers to mutual trade, it would be enormously beneficial and I agree that we need to invest more effort in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">On trade, you know that Europe is ready to negotiate and is ready to move, but we need partners. We cannot just forge agreements when we are not sure that they will be equally matched by the other side. But I agree that we need to be tackling this issue all the time, coming up with proposals and looking for new openings, because global trade will definitely benefit the global economy and this is what most of the world economy needs at this moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, on freedom, security and justice, we are fully aware that this is one of the areas of major interest and concern for our citizens and this is why we devoted such a large proportion of our programme to this area.

      <p sl="pt">The Commission’s work programme for 2011 is clearly based on continuity. Among the proclamations of ‘intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth’ are the guidelines that have prevailed, which have given rise to serious imbalances within the EU, the real divergence of EU economies, the severe crisis and the recessionary outlook that some Member States are facing, with unemployment and deep social injustices. It also includes guidelines such as maintaining the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, liberalisation and the devaluation of the workforce, and I would highlight its insistence on putting forward a new proposal to amend the directive on the organisation of working time. It is also worth noting the statement in the programme with regard to financial regulation that most of the measures to bridge gaps which have been revealed by the crisis have already been put forward. This shows that the promises to bring an end to tax havens and financial derivatives have fallen by the wayside. This shows that financial speculation is continuing unchecked. New attacks on citizen’s rights, freedoms and guarantees are on the horizon, including the travellers’ registration programme, and this is a matter for close attention and active concern.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The communication from the Commission outlining its work programme for 2011 emphasises coming out of the crisis and stimulating economic growth. One significant element is the virtual market, which still has huge potential for development – on condition, however, of the establishment of a truly single market in the Internet. In relation to this, I strongly encourage the Commission to complete a thorough implementation of the Digital Agenda, which is referred to in the communication. I think use of the potential given to us by information technologies should also be seen as a way out of the economic crisis. The development of Internet commerce, measures in the field of intellectual property rights and making the cultural heritage of Europe available online, should be seen as a test of the European Union’s effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs in the area of better lawmaking (2008 report), I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the Commission has decided to include proposals from my report in the plan of work for the year. I am thinking of the greater emphasis placed on ex-post evaluation of European law and the prolongation of the public consultation period for new proposals from 8 to 12 weeks.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the fact that the European Commission is starting the coming year with a substantial work programme. These days, we are witnessing how the rapidly changing economic, financial and international political circumstances override our plans almost every week. I consider it important, therefore, to review the Commission’s work programme several times in the course of next year.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am pleased that the document names job creation as one of the top priorities for 2011, but at the same time, I regret the lack of legislative initiatives for employment and social purposes. The Commission has finally decided to draw up the European Roma framework strategy, but I consider it essential that this be accompanied by draft legislation aimed at integration and prohibiting discrimination. When the Barroso Commission was created, it promised that the submission of its proposals will, in each case, be preceded by an evaluation of their social impact; however, I do not see any trace of this in the current work programme. I expect the Commission to be ready, from the beginning of 2011, to accept and address citizens’ initiatives bearing the signatures of one million EU citizens. At a time when, in certain Member States, we see overt and covert attacks on media freedom and infringements of fundamental democratic rights, I consider it particularly important that the European Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, should pay greater attention than ever to government decisions that threaten the independence of the news media, the system of democratic checks and balances and the rule of law, and should, if necessary, take action in defence of fundamental democratic values.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a woman and politician dealing with gender equality, I am disappointed with the Commission work programme for 2011. Women are completely forgotten by and left out of this programme. I really had to work to find at least once the word ‘women’ … in the Annex. Even there, I quote: ‘Depending on the outcome of the consultation, the Commission may adopt a legislative proposal on reconciliation, including on paternity and filial leave, in 2012.’ ‘Depending on’. ‘May adopt’. ‘In 2012’. This sentence is from a Commission that rushed to produce an empty, so-called Women’s Charter in March, and that neglected the Parliament when it came to negotiating the new gender equality strategy, which, I might add, is no more concrete than the Commission work programme here. We knew in March that Reding’s Charter was only a façade with no substance. We asked repeatedly for a strong legislative text, but Reding did not want to hear about it. Why can we accept a Europe that sanctions Member States when they are financially not in line with EU rules and agreements but we cannot accept a Europe that sanctions Member States that neglect gender equality and compose governments with few or no women ministers?</p>

      <p sl="cs">It is not surprising that the three countries which brought about the collapse of the budget negotiations are net payers and, moreover, recipients of the rebate. Indeed, there can be no doubt that the UK has commenced the obligatory battle for its rebate. The excuses chosen by the budget wreckers are rather feeble. It is quite irresponsible to limit budget flexibility in a time of crisis. We must, on the contrary, increase flexibility in a crisis. The refusal to discuss with Parliament new financial resources for the EU budget in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, and the refusal to enter into dialogue over the multiannual financial framework, constitute sad caricatures of the once-lauded British sense of humour.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Commission work programme for 2011 must contain a proposal for a directive to combat violence against women and an EU programme for financing sport. The Commission has committed itself to these things. It is time they were done. Violence against women is currently the most serious manifestation of discrimination against women and is a violation of human rights. In Europe, as many as 45% of women – that is 100 million – have been the victims of violence. Every day, violence is suffered by between 1 and 2 million European women. There is no justification for the delays in drafting a directive on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also draw attention to the question of sport, which, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, is included in the competences of the European Union. Once again, the Commission, by appealing to budgetary restrictions at national and European level, has put off presentation of an EU programme in this area. I fear that if we accept such an approach, there will never be a programme, because there will always be matters which are more important than sport. However, promoting physical activity brings indisputable benefits in the form of an improvement to the health and wellbeing of Europeans as well as to their efficiency and effectiveness at work. This helps to reduce illnesses and so reduces the costs of healthcare, and it also combats social exclusion. It is also very important to use the potential of older people in the labour market. I hope the Commission will take account of this matter, which has been raised many times, in its future proposals concerning employment and the creation of new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today, there are 23 million unemployed people across the European Union, corresponding to an unemployment rate of about 10%.</p>
      <p sl="en">This situation emerged as a consequence of the financial and economic crisis and we have to face dramatic consequences, but this situation did not deter the European Commission from proposing ambitious objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy, and the European Union has set ambitious targets to meet in the not too distant future.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a headline target for an employment rate of 75% for men and women by 2020, and today, the Commission adopted yet another flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 strategy: an ‘agenda for new skills and jobs’ outlining how we intend to make progress towards full employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is complementary to the flagship ‘Youth on the move’ adopted in September. Both should contribute to reach our 2020 employment and education targets. Yes, the crisis has wiped out millions of jobs. Yes, we face increasing international competition, but that is no excuse to shy away from taking action.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the contrary, it is a call to act and shape our future. Creating more and better jobs is in our hands. Employment policy is largely a Member State responsibility but, as EU policy makers, we in the Commission, together with the European Parliament and the social partners, must do our bit. We must enable everyone who can work to actually do so. We need to allow the workforce to generate new ideas and set up new businesses. We need to ensure that the younger generation can benefit from the social model we have developed. We need better job quality and working conditions for all employees. An agenda for new skills and jobs sets out action in four areas: functioning of labour markets; skills; job quality and working conditions; and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agenda proposes 13 specific actions at EU level to be carried out in partnership with governments, social partners and civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, we have to make sure our labour markets function better by carrying out labour reforms that ensure the necessary flexibility and security. One of the lessons learned in the past two years is that flexicurity policies have contributed to weathering the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now propose to discuss with Member States and social partners all components of flexicurity and how to improve them, building on the EU common principles of flexicurity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agenda points to flexible, but reliable, contractual arrangements, comprehensive lifelong learning, active labour market policies, and modern social security systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are highly segmented labour markets in the EU where employees with permanent safe contracts coexist, and sometimes work side by side in the same workplace doing the same job, with employees who live under temporary contracts with few social safeguards and slim prospects of a permanent job.</p>
      <p sl="en">To improve the situation and reduce existing disparities, one possible avenue for discussion offered by the agenda adopted today could be to extend the use of open-ended contractual arrangements. These would have a sufficiently long probation period and a gradual increase in protection rights, access to training, lifelong learning and career guidance for all employees.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over time, this would allow employees to acquire full rights while firms would have sufficient, but decreasing, flexibility during the probation period, removing the inhibiting elements that often prevent employees from taking on new recruits for the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, we need to equip people with the right skills for the jobs on the market today and in the future. We know that even now, some employers are struggling to fill vacancies because they cannot find people with the right skills.</p>
      <p sl="en">This reveals not only that we need more skills and the right skills, but also that there are persistent mismatches in the EU labour market between available skills and needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the foreseeable future, there could be even more serious shortages of workers than today – ICT practitioners, doctors, nurses, researchers, as well as people with the green skills to help us move towards a greener economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘New skills and jobs’ proposes practical tools in this respect. We will bring more transparency on skill needs and promote better matching, namely through the EU skills panorama to help people see more easily which skills are most needed now and in the future. Commissioner Vassiliou will be able to say more about this. What is clear is that we must work closely with all relevant stakeholders to bridge the gap between education and training and the working world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, we propose to improve the quality of jobs and ensure better working conditions. The EU has very ambitious legislation in this field which needs now to be reviewed. Experience with implementation tells us when and where there is room for improvement. We need to make sure the legislation works better, that it is in line with new working patterns and new technology, and that it is easier to understand and apply for people and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">In practice, we propose to review the Working Time Directive and make a legislative proposal aimed at improving the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive and we will also make proposals in the area of occupational health and safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to reviewing EU legislation, the agenda on new skills and jobs proposes an integrated approach that includes so-called soft instruments from codes of conduct and recommendations to implementing guidelines, benchmarking and exchange of good practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to discussing these issues with you and I am confident that together with the European Parliament, the Member States and the social partners, we can make them work better.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last, but certainly not least, we need to create more jobs. Job creation is needed for growth, but there are too many obstacles in the way. We propose to improve the framework conditions for job creation, especially in fast-moving and R&amp;D-intensive sectors, by reducing the administrative burden and taxes on labour, and by helping entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also propose action to foster entrepreneurship and support people who are in the process of setting up a business or have done so recently.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect, one can never reiterate too often the importance of the new micro-finance facility as a tool to help people set up their own businesses. The European Union has plenty of talent. Let us make sure that the ideas and innovations around lead to the creation of quality jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, the Commission has presented its priorities on how to make progress towards full employment. An agenda for new skills and jobs can make a real difference if we all work together. I call on you all to play your part in moving forward in our endeavour to reach full employment in Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-504" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Androulla Vassiliou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am particularly glad to present, together with Commissioner Andor, this new flagship initiative ‘An agenda for new skills and jobs’. Better education and training is fundamental for equipping people with the skills they need to find work, stay in work and prepare themselves for the jobs of the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the reason why we need to invest in people and in their capacity to innovate, to create new enterprises and new jobs. Without significant and sustained investment in high skill levels and education, our economies will struggle to emerge from the crisis quickly. Skills are at the heart of Europe 2020 for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This is the reason why two flagship initiatives, ‘Youth on the move’ and ‘An agenda for new skills and jobs’, have important education and training as well as employment dimensions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, with this initiative, we want to reflect on how education and training can contribute to reaching a 75% employment rate by 2020. Jobs occupied by highly qualified people are expected to rise by 16 million between now and 2020, while those held by low skilled workers will decline by around 12 million over the same period. There are more than 80 million adults in Europe hampered by severe deficiencies in basic skills. Urgent action is therefore needed, especially on the education side.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we need to recognise lifelong learning as one of the crucial pillars of flexible security strategies in order to make sure that our labour market functions better, as Commissioner Andor has said. We all agree on the diagnosis. Skills can secure and improve transitions in the labour market, but lifelong learning is not yet a reality in Europe. Upgrading skills should not be a luxury for the highly qualified. It is a necessity for all. The low qualified have very few opportunities to participate in continuous training in all Member States. This should change with the joint effort of all partners, governments, employers and citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need to provide people with the right skills for employment. Europe needs not only to upgrade the skills of people already in the labour market but also to ensure that people get, from the start, the right mix of skills to adapt and evolve in a fast-changing society. We need, firstly, to forecast better the skills needed in the labour market. With that aim in mind, we will present an EU skills panorama which will not only tell us what skills employers are looking for now but will also forecast what skills will be needed in the future. In order to prepare our young people for entering the labour market, and to adapt and work in jobs that may not even exist yet, we need to focus on education systems delivering the right mix of skills. Specific emphasis should be put on basic skills in reading, mathematics and science.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is of the utmost importance to fight especially against low educational achievement and early school leaving. This is the reason why I decided to launch a high-level group on literacy in January. Moreover, in order to develop a knowledge-based society, we need our children to be better at science, maths and technology. But we also want to focus our effort on the acquisition of transversal skills, which are crucial for employability: for example, language skills, digital literacy or entrepreneurship, and initiative-taking skills. It is, I believe, equally important that we act in order to ensure that we develop the competences which the jobs of the future will require, for example, in renewable energy, green building, smart transport and e-health, just to name a few.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, even in times of crisis and high unemployment rates, some employers are reporting difficulties in recruiting. The agenda calls, therefore, for better matching of people’s skills and job opportunities and capitalising on Europe’s potential. To this end, I will propose a European skills passport, which will enable citizens to record their skills in a clear and comparable way. This will build on the popular Europass CV. My last point is that neither education nor employment alone can deliver the right mix of skills.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must seek new forms of cooperation and partnership with education and training providers, business and other stakeholders, including trade unions and public employment services.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, with Europe 2020, we set our targets and our aspirations. Now is the time to make progress towards our aspirations and to determine our reform strategy. The agenda for new skills and jobs explains how Europe can contribute to reaching our targets. The way out of the crisis is to develop a competitive, knowledge-based economy in Europe providing more and better jobs in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioners, although befitting Parliament’s traditions, we tend to approach proposals with a helpful intention, yet critically, I must say now that I wholeheartedly welcome and support the notion just outlined. I am particularly pleased about the definition used by Commissioner Andor in connection with full employment as the target, that whoever is able to and wants to should be given the means and opportunity to work.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I also support the four main priorities: better functioning labour markets, better quality jobs, more efficient job creation policies and better working conditions, even if we see that it will not be easy to achieve them. We agree with what has been said on flexicurity, although I must say that it is indeed high time we talked about the details. We use the term frequently and interpret what it really means in a variety of ways.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In harmony with the basic principles of better legislation, we believe it is necessary to react to changing working conditions. Thus, it is justified to review the Working Time Directive, although I wish to point out that we do not feel the necessity for a new directive where the Posting of Workers Directive is concerned, but are ready to discuss implementation and the experience gained in the course of implementation and, if need be, make amendments. However, I wish to draw attention to the regulation of atypical forms of work. This means entirely new employer and employee relations in respect of both social security and other conditions, and obviously there are still many gaps in this field.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Mobility must be increased and more attention needs to be paid to the cooperation of state employment services. Finally, Mr President, I can see that time is running out, I fully agree that in a sense, low qualifications cost more than the crisis. Therefore, we must make sure, for everyone’s benefit, that we continue to think in terms of appropriate and flexible training, acknowledging the possibility of formal and informal training.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I listened to the statements by the two Commissioners with a great deal of pleasure. In times of crisis, especially acute crisis, we need a vision. These two statements give us a vision. They are ambitious. They set four objectives which I think every European citizen will want to support.</p>
      <p sl="el">But – however nice things are, there is always a ‘but’ – I first of all want to raise the question of security. Flexibility and security need to go hand in hand and, in our opinion, priority needs to be given to security. The question of education and training is a very, very basic question because, as Commissioner Andor quite rightly said, not only do we need new skills, we need to send the old skills in the direction we want. There are issues relating to entrepreneurship. We must make it easier for young people to open their own business. We must make it easier for businesses to take on more people.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to refer to Commission Vassiliou’s very nice idea: a European skills passport. That immediately puts me in mind of seconded workers and I think and ask myself: if I have a passport with exceptional skills and I come from country A and I go and work in country B, will the question of my contract of employment have been resolved? We are at your side; we shall monitor and fight with you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I will deal with just one of your four key priorities: stronger policies to promote job creation and demand for labour.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to this document, recovery must be based on job-creating growth but, since the economic crisis, economic growth in Europe has been uneven and weak. As an Irish MEP, I am acutely aware of how we are being told to implement austerity measures and the real fear is that this will smother any opportunity for growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">So my question is: will this agenda for new jobs and growth not apply to Ireland or Greece or, indeed, any country that is implementing these severe austerity measures? Where will the growth come from and, consequently, where will the jobs come from?</p>
      <p sl="de">There are excellent ideas in this document; I am not trying to minimise them. One crucial one is how we connect our investment and research and development and innovation to the production system itself. There is an absolute necessity to lock the two together.</p>
      <p sl="de">Proposals to engage the social economy, cooperatives, mutual societies and micro-enterprises in a sustained effort to provide employment opportunities at local level are very timely and, indeed, I believe that mobilisation at local level and on a not-for-profit basis, through mutual societies, can be a driver for sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="de">The promotion of entrepreneurship will allow citizens themselves to play a real part in our economic recovery. The matching of skills to jobs is crucial, but I am very concerned on many fronts, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last week, I hosted a meeting in Parliament on social inclusion and mental illness and a mild-mannered lady from Austria said that politicians have to stop talking about jobs and growth – nobody believes them! I do not know about you, Commissioner, but that shook me. I am not saying that that feeling is widespread, but it is spreading, and I think that is why our words here have to be translated into action.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a real urgency about this and we need to start thinking outside the box. Yes to green jobs, digital jobs, but do not forget local jobs and, as I said, the promotion of a not-for-profit ethos, not as a replacement, but as a counterbalance to the profit-driven model, which right now threatens the euro and the stability of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Vassiliou, Mr Andor, we had great expectations of the agenda for new skills and jobs. It was intended to create an impetus which would help employees in Europe to prepare for environmental change. Most importantly, after Parliament came up with a series of ideas in its resolution on green jobs, we expected the Commission to take up these ideas, develop them further and then propose specific measures which define how new jobs can be created by means of environmental change or existing jobs adapted so that they can be preserved, in order to make European industrial society greener for the benefit of the workers. What have you done instead? You have revived the old subject of flexicurity. Do you really believe that new jobs can be created by means of deregulation? We have just established that the precarious jobs are the ones which are lost during a crisis and they are the first ones to go.</p>
      <p sl="de">All I can say here is that you are wrong if you think that a knowledge-based, sustainable economy can be developed on the basis of uncertainty and poor working conditions. Your focus is on poverty through work, instead of on increasing prosperity. However, poverty is not a good accompaniment to progress. In order to make environmental progress, we need a wide-ranging programme of education and training for all employees and, in particular, for those at lower levels. Please continue to work on this agenda and introduce the necessary improvements.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not intend my speech to be the usual eurosceptic exercise in rhetoric but a call for the EU to start to look at the contents more than the packaging and abandon propaganda in favour of hard facts.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now that the Lisbon Strategy has failed, the EU has come up with a new slogan ‘EU 2020’, but it has not actually come up with any innovative response to employment problems. The statistics bear this out: the unemployment rate in Europe stands at 9.6%, the youth unemployment rate at 20.2%. In Italy, the third net contributor to the EU budget, the situation for young people is even more dramatic, with 25.9% of young people jobless.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would prefer a Europe where resources are not wasted in promotional campaigns, but there are efficient investments so that the training available prepares professionals for the internal market sector where there are proper job opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by emphasising the importance of vocational training, a symbol of excellence in our nations. The craft sector offers employment potential and a unique wealth of knowledge that must be used to sustain the competitiveness of the European system.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, we have set ourselves the goal of identifying the needs of the job market in the coming years. This means we are speaking of the future of young Europeans, of the professions and the economies that will sustain our communities tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="it">For all too long, we have been wondering about the types of jobs that will be available in ten years, about how qualifications will change and about the skills required throughout the Union. We ask ourselves continually whether the education and training currently offered to European citizens will help them find a job easily.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wonder how the Commission actually intends to go about adopting new measures to achieve the goals it has set itself. Are we sure we know all the needs of young people? Are we sure that e-learning is the solution, or can we study new and more telling forms of education and training? Only six months are left before the pilot project launched in May 2010 concludes, meaning it is already time to draw up budgets. Will the results we achieve be positive? Will they be encouraging? We must aim to train young people using European educational policies that are capable of anticipating future needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Not long ago, I heard a long list of things we ‘have to do’. To use medical terminology, I have heard a lot about diagnosis but not a lot about the cure. We must not be content with a lot of hot air but must work with substantial ideas, as the EU 2020 strategy demands. This is the challenge that all Member States and enterprises must tackle and this is the best legacy that we can leave to our children.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, new skills for new jobs is a very important subject. Why is this? Because it is all about the future. It is not just about us muddling our way through the challenges that we are already aware of, such as demographic change and the economic crisis. It is also about the fact that additional qualifications will give people the opportunity to design the jobs of the future and, therefore, to make an active contribution to an innovative economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Andor, you place a great deal of importance on the social partnership, which is a good thing. However, I would like to encourage the Commission to focus on working conditions and the physical and, above all, mental stresses of a busy working life. What use is it to society if people produce high levels of performance in the short term, but in the long term, turn into burnt-out wrecks? None at all. Therefore, the systematic evaluation of the acquis communautaire should be based on this approach and not on better regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of flexicurity, I do not approve of the Commission proposal for a kind of introductory employment contract, which only offers full employment rights after a certain period of time. It seems to me rather shabby to treat young people, who are so important for our future, in this way right at the start of their professional careers. Does this mean that the Commission is more or less giving up on precarious employment relations? I would very much like to see the Commission making improvements in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks. As Mrs Harkin said, the people of Europe do not want concepts; they want concrete solutions. I would like to thank you for your initiative. There are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to. However, I believe that some improvements are needed, because more flexibility and more mobility will not create a single new job. I would like to endorse what Mrs Schroedter said in this respect. We need good, secure jobs in Europe and the Member States and businesses must ensure that these are permanent jobs which allow people to earn a good living. This must become a general rule once again and we must work towards this on a European level and choose the right course.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the agenda, you refer to new forms of employment contract with fewer rights for employees who are just starting their careers. You refer to these as open-ended contractual arrangements. In my view, this will not create any new jobs. Experience shows, and the Social Democratic government in Germany found this out a few years ago, that weakening employees’ rights will not result in any jobs being created. Measures of this kind simply turn secure jobs into precarious jobs. We must not allow this to happen in future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the timing of this debate is particularly apt, with the EU economy’s recovery remaining fragile and Member States still facing a depressed situation on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why European society needs to become a knowledge-based society. The EU must ensure that there is a better correlation between the demand and supply for jobs and that the workforce has the necessary skills to take up the newly created jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With regard to Romania, the most recent Commission monitoring report indicates that the labour market has been stable since the start of 2010. However, the recovery cannot be accompanied immediately by a reduction in unemployment. Unfortunately, young people in Romania are still one of the groups hardest hit. More than 20% of them do not have a job.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this respect, I think that the European Commission’s instrument is useful, given that its prime objective is to boost the involvement of young people in the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, if we are discussing unemployment, it is surely necessary to cry out loud about unemployment among the young, which runs at twice, and in some countries, four times the European average. I welcome the agenda presented much more than the strategy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must adopt specific measures to support employment and effective monitoring. We must definitely boost cooperation between national ministries of labour and education and create a long-term strategy on what the labour market will demand from potential job seekers, and not just what it demands now.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Education and training for a profession is a long-term process, and we therefore need to know what we will need in 10 years, and not just now, so that we can support the next generation. The Commissioner mentioned better education and investment in people. I fully agree with her on this. Only through greater investment in educating the young will we manage to create a competitive generation and a better European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would therefore like to call on the EU Member States not to cut education and youth budgets but, in these difficult times, to make them even stronger. Every cent more spent on education will produce a hundredfold return in a contented and strong future generation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the focus of these measures must be to make the best possible use of the human resources available within the European Union, rather than opting for mass immigration. In specific terms, this means developing new, long-term skills, which match the new requirements of the labour market. We need a programme of further training for those EU citizens who have interrupted their education either at school, during an apprenticeship or at university.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we need incentives for further education, retraining measures and lifelong learning. When the labour market is opened up to the countries of Eastern Europe in 2011, the EU will be obliged to take measures to protect citizens in those Member States that will be particularly affected by the opening up of the labour market. Less skilled workers and also self-employed contractors in these Member States will be the first victims of this change. I expect the Commission to provide these people with adequate protection against unemployment, cheap labour and social dumping.</p>

      <p sl="it">More targeted training, real education directed at acquiring knowledge and abilities that serve the labour market, development of young people through their training and their knowledge – which must be enriched on a daily basis – and a labour market that needs new skills, but which needs to put migratory flows to the best possible use.</p>
      <p sl="it">The four objectives are encouraging, but there is no doubt that we must put the many instruments that the Commission has at its disposal to better use. We must be far-sighted and prudent, but by the same token, the new frontier of technology must guide our choices to ensure that the 2020 strategy is consistent with effective training and a real will to pave the way for a labour market that serves European society and, above all, young people.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the main concern of European citizens is linked to keeping their jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As a result of the economic and financial crisis, the unemployment rate has reached 10%, with the rate of youth unemployment at 20%. Young people and the over-50s are encountering difficulties in finding a job and are often forced to accept temporary labour contracts or a job below the qualifications they have obtained.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The agenda for creating new jobs and new skills must be linked to the Union’s industrial policy and innovation policy. In order to maintain the Union’s competitiveness, we must not only develop an innovative capacity, but also recreate the production capacity, which means creating jobs in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">An eco-efficient economy obviously requires new skills.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to draw attention to the high school dropout rate. An ever growing number of young people are unable to attend a secondary school or university. Education guarantees a future for young people. This is why it is our duty to guarantee young people access to education.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very happy that the fundamental principles of this flagship initiative to boost and improve employment in Europe and finally reach an ambitious target by 2020 have been welcomed. We are, of course, open to discussing the various details now and at a later stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to address some of the points that have been discussed or perhaps even challenged in the discussion, because some of them need further explanation.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we maintain the concept of flexicurity, but this does not mean that we want to put the emphasis only on flexibility, in which case we would use this concept the way it was used before.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to give you some examples where there is clearly a reflection of the current times and a reflection of the new challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are definitely making this initiative more age-conscious, and when we speak about lifelong learning, we want to put a greater emphasis on the lifelong learning opportunities of older workers, because we have to assume that active working life is becoming longer and people will have to be assisted more with career changes or career developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to have a better focus on young people, which is clearly a key consideration for Europe 2020. But a separate flagship initiative – ‘Youth on the move’ – already exists, where most of the initiatives and strategies in connection with the young generation are outlined in very concrete terms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Youth is the age group where we do not want to push for a greater level of flexibility, because there is already enough. There is more flexibility for young workers in Europe than in the United States. We want to facilitate more mobility, because we believe that the young generation is the one that can better take advantage of the integrated European labour market and develop their own skills and improve their competitiveness through taking advantage not only of the market itself but also of the institutions that the European Union provides.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I spoke about was better working conditions and quality jobs. I regret that Ms Schroedter did not understand it perfectly. We want to address segmentation as a major challenge of the current European labour market, and we put forward a very concrete example: the open-ended contract, which can help. It is not about removing people from permanent contracts, it is helping those who, so far, only had a chance to have a short-term or fixed-term contract, to have an open-ended one and build up their rights. This will help, to some extent, to provide more jobs, but it will definitely help to provide more rights. This is also very important if we want to speak about quality jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we speak about investing in human capital, we should not forget that the European Social Fund is there to support all these initiatives in all Member States, and we hope that it will remain a robust instrument of the EU in supporting all these initiatives on employment and social inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are initiatives for 10 years and for all Member States. It is not about addressing short-term emergency financial situations in certain Member States. We cannot assume that all the 10 years will be spent amidst financial emergencies. This is obviously not a policy that can be so specific as to address this situation, but it does apply to Greece and to Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that Greece is one of the countries where more flexibility could help to boost the business investment climate, as is the case with Spain. Ireland is a country which could rebalance competitiveness factors and have a greater focus on investing in skills and education, as opposed to other sources of competitiveness that have been extensively used recently.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must, of course, pay attention to the very critical situation we are in at this moment, and maybe next year there will be little chance of increasing the level of employment. But we also have to look at the overall picture, which will start to improve from the first half of next year, because the major economies driving the recovery forward are already experiencing job growth. We believe that, despite the disturbances in the financial sector, this process will continue and the European policies which we have put forward, although not being able to micromanage job creation in the Member States, will create the right framework and provide guidance for the Member States to continue working towards full employment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The current economic crisis and structural factors such as globalisation, technological progress, an ageing population and the move towards a low carbon economy have highlighted the need to adapt European employment policies and made EU institutions devise relevant solutions for tackling the rise in unemployment and fighting poverty. Indeed, the Commission’s initiative as part of the EU 2020 strategy offers a response from the European Union to the challenges raised by the current economic climate and the economic and social changes taking place on the labour market. I wish to emphasise how important it is to achieve the two objectives mentioned by the Commission in this initiative. These are to exit the economic crisis using skills improvement as a tool for doing this and to guarantee the European economy’s long-term competitiveness by anticipating future needs and ensuring a harmonious balance between the supply and demand for skills on the labour market. Europe needs to increase its competitiveness in an ever-growing global competitive environment. Skills provide the key to exiting the crisis and enabling Europe’s citizens to improve their standard of living. I welcome this initiative which encourages the exchange of information and the involvement of Member States in discussions aimed at identifying solutions or practices conducive to creating new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The European Union has very ambitiously committed to increasing employment by as much as 75% over the coming decade. In order for this to become a reality, we must take concrete measures both at EU and national levels. I feel that it is particularly important to enhance social partnership and social dialogue with specific measures at all levels – EU, national, regional, sectoral and company. Secondly, employees’ skills and qualifications must be improved continually and must satisfy the needs of the labour market. Therefore, it is necessary to bring the general, vocational and higher education systems closer to the needs of the labour market. We are constantly hearing that there need to be more jobs, but how can they be created? There must be a specific mechanism providing incentives and certain tax incentives to create jobs for young people and the elderly. Furthermore, it is necessary to analyse the impact of micro-finance instruments on the labour market and to allow more flexibility to use money from the European Social Fund. I really hope that an agenda for new skills and jobs would provide concrete results for people in our countries.</p>

The Commission should be alert, however, to the increasing phenomenon of external migration that is being recorded in Greece; young, skilled and highly skilled members of the labour force are emigrating to Canada, Australia and the Emirates. It seems that the same process has started in Ireland, as well. On the other hand, Germany has announced that it needs skilled labour. There is no reason for Germany to import such labour from third countries. It could collaborate with the southern Member States to employ a skilled European labour force.

      <p sl="unknown">Question 17 by Georgios Papanikolaou (H-0515/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Young people in precarious employment</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As the Commission notes in its communication ‘Youth on the move’, young people are often trapped in a chain of temporary employment contracts that reduces their chances of moving on to more stable contracts and exacerbates their job insecurity. The problem is even more acute in Member States where labour law is particularly protectionist. Can the Commission answer the following questions:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does it believe that the often doubtful quality and uncontrolled duration of traineeships exacerbate this problem? Will it take specific action as part of the objectives set in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Youth on the Move programme to support youth employment and strengthen their job security?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Will the Commission pursue specific and even more targeted policies to promote and strengthen youth employment in those Member States that are facing an economic recession?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-524" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, two months ago, the Commission presented the ‘Youth on the move’ flagship initiative as part of the Europe 2020 strategy. This sends a clear signal that the Commission has a special concern for young people.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘Youth on the move’ has three objectives: to improve education, increase employment and foster mobility for young people across the European Union. It will involve action to make education and training more relevant to young people’s needs, encourage them to take advantage of EU grants to study or train in another country and overcome obstacles to entering and making progress in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The two labour market problems which the honourable Member has raised, namely, traineeships and labour market segmentation, are among the topics ‘Youth on the move’ takes up. I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the Commission’s views and aims regarding these two topics. I want to stress, first and foremost, that both fall within the Member States’ national competence in terms of practical implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with traineeships, or internships as they are also sometimes called. I know that the European Parliament regards these as very important, as Ms Turunen’s report earlier this year showed. The underlying problem is that employers are reluctant to recruit young workers with little or no practical experience. This is why acquiring initial work experience through traineeships has grown in importance for young people over the years. However, they must be of high quality and have clear learning objectives. In addition, they should not replace normal jobs or probation periods at the start of a work contract.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission intends to develop a quality framework for traineeships but, as a first step, we need to improve our knowledge in this area. The Commission will soon be launching a study to gain an overview of existing legal arrangements and practice across the Member States. This is part of a pilot project involving measures for employment maintenance, for which Parliament has provided the Commission with an extra budget for 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">A second set of issues is labour market segmentation. Young people are in a difficult position in terms of job security. Too many have short-term contracts, often alternating with unemployment, and many young people – even those who are well qualified – have little chance of getting more stable contracts. We need to tackle labour market segmentation as a matter of urgency, in particular, because it affects young people and their employment prospects most and because it endangers the future competitiveness of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">A report on employment in Europe, to be released by the Commission in a few days, finds that temporary workers are paid 14% less and receive less training than workers on permanent contracts. This has a negative impact on productivity. This applies to young people especially. Those with temporary jobs account for 40% of the total, against 13% among the overall working-age population. This means that young people bear the brunt of adjustment.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, young people are experiencing more and more difficulties in getting into the labour market. The percentage of young people who are not in education, employment or training ranges from about 4% in Denmark and the Netherlands to 16 to 20% in Italy, Cyprus and Bulgaria. Reducing labour market segmentation is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission has identified this as one of the priorities the Member States should focus on in line with the common flexicurity principles under EU 2020 and the European Employment strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In practical terms, the Commission proposes that Member States with segmented labour markets should consider introducing an open-ended single contract that provides for a sufficiently long probation period and a gradual increase in protection in place of the current legal disparities between permanent and temporary contracts. The Youth Employment Framework under ‘Youth on the move’ gives guidance on how policy makers, stakeholders and institutions can make progress in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Closer policy coordination under the European Semester, which we are currently preparing with the Member States, will offer the right framework for stimulating the development of policy and reforms that will benefit young people.</p>

      <p sl="el">Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply. Today, I read in the European Commission’s communications about the adoption of an agenda for new skills and work. Today’s communications refer, among other things, to the decision to promote an open single contract to replace the various types of temporary and permanent contracts.</p>
      <p sl="el">My question is very straightforward: will the Commission be able to guarantee under this initiative that open single contracts will improve young people’s sense of security at work? In other words, will the current situation be improved, insofar as it can be improved?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, obtaining a permanent job and establishing a decent lifestyle are very important goals for most young people. They have been hard hit by the most recent economic crisis and are often forced to take short-term jobs or low paid internships, which also means, of course, that they are not contributing to a pension. This makes long-term life planning difficult. Therefore, I would like to know: Does the Commission intend to put measures in place which will guarantee permanent jobs for young people in particular? Or to put it another way: Are directives being planned which will introduce standards for temporary jobs?</p>

However, I would like to ask whether the Commission feels we should adopt a separate European Union youth entrepreneurship and innovation programme which would promote and support young people’s creativity and enterprise? Where would you stand as regards opportunities for young people to take advantage of microcredits? Should the procedure for recognising companies established by young people be legally regulated?</p>

      <p sl="en">The previous discussion extensively covered the open-ended contract, which I think is one of the practical solutions. In addition to that, we have seen during this year that the Commission discussed the situation of young people and the impact of the crisis on youth employment, and ‘Youth on the move’ has already addressed this in concrete terms. Further initiatives are obviously possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will have to monitor the situation and work with the Member States. During this phase, we have just gathered details of the national programmes developed by the Member States, and after analysing these and looking at the practical solutions and undertakings they made, we will be able to come forward with further suggestions. The most important one here, however, is to shape a macro-economic environment in Europe that will facilitate a continued, robust recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">One further point I would like to make is that young people have, of course, been among those who have suffered most from job losses and the lack of opportunities in the last couple of years. We are aware of the long-term risk of this which is not just as an immediate employment or social question. If we do not take action, it can have an impact on demography trends which are already extremely complicated, so in the next term, in a kind of alliance or cooperation with the Hungarian Presidency, we will discuss this in the context of a demographic discussion, because demography and family policies also have to be looked at in the same context as job security and income security for young people in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Enhancing competitiveness through alternative energies</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It is the objective of the Commission, and of us all, to guarantee our fellow citizens a comfortable and secure standard of living within a framework that fosters the competitiveness of European companies. Use of alternative energy sources is one solution that can help improve the competitiveness of production.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the honourable Member has been speaking about the subject of renewable energy and asking what we plan to do to achieve our joint targets. Three years ago, the European Council set us some ambitious climate goals. One of these concerns renewable energy, which, by 2020, must make up 20% of the total energy consumption in the European Union. Each Member State must exploit the opportunities available to it and make a mandatory contribution to achieving this goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we divide this 20% across the various different sectors, such as transport, heating, electricity, industry and agriculture, it is clear that electricity generation is the most important. In order to achieve the target of 20% of total energy consumption, we need around 35% of our electricity to be generated from renewable sources. If we are to do this efficiently and ensure that the price is affordable for consumers, we must make use of the best locations. Each Member State has different strengths and weaknesses, which must be exploited, and these include wind from the North Sea, sun in the southern part of the European Union and biogas from rural areas. Obviously, in order to ensure our security of supply, we need to make significant improvements in the quality and capacity of our infrastructure, our transport networks and our storage facilities. The Commission took this point into consideration a few days ago when we discussed and adopted an energy infrastructure package which focuses, in part, on integrating and feeding in renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have set binding targets for renewable energy for every Member State. In a few days, on 5 December, we will reach the transposition deadline and the Commission will begin following up on the implementation of the directive, in order to ensure that the appropriate incentives have been put in place and that suitable subsidy measures have been taken, which will allow the binding targets to be achieved. The Member States must concentrate on creating the ideal conditions for the use of renewable energy. Among other things, the European Union directive calls for Member States to produce national action plans specifying the necessary measures and the concrete, binding national targets, broken down by sector, such as transport, heating, electricity conversion and industry. The next step involves removing the administrative obstacles to renewable energy. A third important area is the construction industry. Around 40% of our energy is used in industrial buildings, service sector premises and private homes.</p>
      <p sl="de">By the end of 2012, we want qualification and certification schemes to be in place for the installation of renewable energy facilities. These include distribution and transmission networks which must be prepared for the development and increase in renewable energy and which must also guarantee priority access for renewable energy. The Member States can be flexible in their choice of technologies. They can decide which types of renewable energy they will invest in to achieve the binding targets. The Commission will subsidise innovations and projects which aim to research into, develop and commercialise technologies for renewable energy, using funding from the seventh framework programme that you in this House have made available to us.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission also has money from the European Economic Recovery Plan for three years which is specifically intended for renewable energy projects, in this case, for the development of offshore wind energy. I would like to emphasise to the new Member States that cohesion programmes and funding to promote renewable energy are also available. Renewable energy has a high priority in our energy and climate policy, in particular, with regard to reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels. Only by working together will we succeed in achieving our ambitious climate goals and increasing Europe’s competitiveness. I am relying on a close partnership with the Member States regarding the use of the different energy resources.</p>

This is not what is happening in my country, Lithuania, for example. Of course, that is the responsibility of the national governments, but the Commission could provide them with assistance.</p>

      <p sl="en">I have two questions, firstly regarding the 2020 strategy. Is he confident that we will reach the 20% target for renewable energies in that strategy? Secondly, he mentioned grids. How realistic, desirable and affordable would a Europe-wide grid be, and is it attainable?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks, we will be submitting to you, the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States our proposal on how we plan to achieve a 20% increase in energy efficiency. Looking at the three targets which you have set us, with regard to the 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, we are making good progress towards this objective. I am sure that, if we continue with our current efforts, we will reach or even exceed the target of 20% less CO2 in 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of 20% renewable energy, we are also doing well, although the progress made in the different Member States varies. Some Member States were already a long way ahead when compared with the reference year. For example, Austria had a 23% share of renewable energy five years ago and is expected to reach a level of 34% by 2020. In contrast, the figure for the United Kingdom was only 1.3% and for Malta 0%, which meant that these countries had to start virtually from scratch. The leaders include Sweden, which is aiming for 49%, and Finland and Portugal with a goal of 38%. The Baltic States, with targets of 25%, 40% and 23%, have also been very successful and their figures are above the European average in this important area.</p>
      <p sl="de">The target of a 20% increase in energy efficiency is the one which gives me most concern. This involves making intelligent energy savings and using energy in a targeted way. I will be happy to talk to Parliament about this during the first quarter of next year when I will be able to submit to you our proposal for achieving a 20% improvement in energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned the media. In fact, on the subject of renewable energy and consumers, more can be done by industry and investors, both investors in technology and financial investors. I have a proposal for you. I am planning to visit the three Baltic States next spring. I will be happy to attend a conference of representatives of the media, the banks and business, if you can suggest suitable candidates, in order to increase awareness in your country, using my modest resources, and to open up opportunities for new programmes and cofinancing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The next question was: What do I think of a European energy network? I want to answer this very openly. If you look at the transport infrastructure in Europe, we have roads, motorways, railways, the European airspace, with its large and small regional airports, and major ports, such as Genoa, Marseilles, Hamburg and Rotterdam. There are also terminals for liquid natural gas and for oil in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Baltic, the North Sea and the Atlantic. In addition, we have a digital infrastructure for information, communications and navigation, including our mobile phone network. In comparison to these areas, our energy networks are lagging far behind. We can transport televisions, pig carcasses, tinned foods and other goods from Portugal to Latvia and from Holland to Greece, we can transport workers and tourists and we can transfer information and financial services, but our gas and electricity networks are still divided up along the lines of 19th century principalities. We need to integrate the markets in the Baltic States, Finland, central Europe and Greece, before Serbia and Croatia join the European Union. We also need bridges and interconnectors to transport electricity in both directions between Spain, France and Germany. Over the next 20 years, we must put in place the financing and the legislation to ensure that our transport networks for electricity and gas are of the same quality and have the same capacity as our road and rail networks and our airspace, which can be used to transport goods and give people freedom of movement. Otherwise, we will not have security of supply or be able to show solidarity in an emergency. We will not be in a position to exchange storage capacity or establish renewable energy facilities in the best locations and bring the electricity to the centres of population. In addition, we will not have the competition which consumers want or be able to establish an internal market, which has always been one of the basic principles of the European Union and which must become a reality for gas and electricity.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, I strongly support a major initiative to develop the transport networks for electricity, gas and oil.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 19 by Kinga Göncz (H-0546/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Structural Funds and disability</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Many reports on the use of the Structural Funds show that, even if resources reach those who need them most, this is not done in the manner that would be most beneficial for them or in such a way as to bring about a genuine improvement in the quality of their lives.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission plan to prevent the Structural Funds being used to finance the institutionalisation of people with disabilities? How does it plan to encourage their use to finance community-based alternatives to institutional care and promote the social inclusion of people with disabilities?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-536" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">As you are aware, social policy, including policy relating to people with disabilities, is primarily a national responsibility. However, stepping up support for disadvantaged groups and, in particular, for people with disabilities, including people living in institutions, is a key strand for action under the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to some estimates, people with disabilities account for at least 16% of the EU working age population, but only 40% of people with disabilities are employed. The Commission encourages a shift from institutional to community-based care and is working closely with the Member States and, in particular, the managing authorities of the ESF and the ERDF and NGOs in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2009, the Commission published a report by an ad hoc expert group on the switchover from institutional to community-based care. In line with the principle of shared management, the Member States are responsible for selecting operations for financing under the structural funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current programming period, the European Social and Regional Development Funds are supporting some de-institutionalisation schemes and the switch-over from residential care to community-based services. This is particularly true in certain Member States that joined the EU after 2004. Thus, projects are being financed in Bulgaria and Slovakia.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Commission is currently working on new provisions on the structural funds for the post-2013 period and will put forward proposals in 2011. To step up the fight against discrimination and promote social inclusion of people with disabilities, future operational programmes may, for example, be required to identify the groups at risk of discrimination and exclusion. The Commission will explore the role that national equality bodies could play and may consider stricter requirements on Member States’ reporting of measures to combat discrimination, implemented with support from the structural funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, one of the aims of the European Disability Strategy for 2010 to 2020, which the Commission adopted on 15 November, is to give impetus to Member States’ efforts to ease the transition from institutional to community-based care. The strategy seeks to do this by identifying good practice in using the structural funds to encourage people to live independently and in the community and aims to develop awareness-raising initiatives that target structural fund managing bodies at EU and national level. For example, a toolkit on how to use the structural funds to support the development of community-based services will be developed for the managing authorities.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, indeed, it was this issue that I wished to pose further questions about and comment on. I was pleased to hear the Commissioner’s answer. In fact, my supplementary question is whether, on the basis of these principles, the Commission plans to introduce a kind of new conditionality in the next budget period that prevents the strengthening of segregation but allows, say, the use of these funds to target social integration specifically. The problem was that these funds were often used for building and rebuilding large institutions rather than for integrated housing. I believe there are many good experts who will willingly help the Commission as well as the Member States in this.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Thank you for your answer, Commissioner. I would like to congratulate the European Commission which earlier this month presented the new European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. However, I have the following question.

      <p sl="en">The Belgian Presidency held a conference in Liège about the future of cohesion policies on the basis of the Fifth Cohesion Report, which we jointly published with Commissioner Hahn. Conditionality was one of the main discussion points and, as regards the European Social Fund, the situation described by Mrs Göncz is being covered, and we would like to develop conditionality in that sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">Conditionality has various meanings and, unfortunately, some of these are seen as unfair or counterproductive. We believe that the real meaning of conditionality, as regards the structural funds, is that awareness and responsibility have to be raised not just as regards the content, but also the context of the projects and the operational programmes. We really have to connect with the social reality when we fund programmes in various regions and microregions, and we will take this very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have been working recently with some Member States on community-based services. For example, in Bulgaria, a joint project was financed by the European Social and Regional Development Fund to close down institutions for children with disabilities, as a first step in implementing an ambitious action plan to close down all existing institutions for children and providing family-type care and new services to support families. This particular programme was in the range of EUR 39 million but there are also similar ones not only in Bulgaria, but also in Slovakia.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Anglo Irish Bank</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Commissioner Almunia in a statement on the Irish financial sector said that there were ‘a number of important aspects that still needed to be clarified’ in relation to Anglo Irish Bank. Will the Commission explain what these important issues are?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-541" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, when Mr Mitchell tabled these questions on 7 October, the situation was not the same as it is today in Ireland and in the Irish banking sector. My answer will take into account what has happened since this question was asked.</p>
      <p sl="en">Seven days before your question was tabled, on 30 September, the Irish Finance Minister, Mr Lenihan, discussed the total cost of the restructuring of the Anglo Irish Bank, giving two possible figures: a mid-range estimate of EUR 29 billion and a higher estimate of EUR 34 billion. At the time, total capital injections from public funds to Anglo Irish amounted to around EUR 23 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">As always, since the beginning of this crisis, according to our banking and restructuring information, when financial institutions receive injections of public capital, they have to present a restructuring plan to the Commission. Following much discussion on Anglo Irish, this restructuring plan was presented by the Irish Government on 26 October. In this draft restructuring plan, they considered a winding-down scenario for Anglo Irish proposing the split of Anglo into two banks – an asset recovery bank to wind down the assets of the bank and a funding bank to get the resources needed to keep it running during the process of winding down its assets.</p>
      <p sl="en">A scenario in which assets are wound down is less problematic than one in which the bank continues to operate, both in terms of State aid rules and competition. Consequently, I made some public statements saying that, in our opinion, the task was therefore not as difficult as negotiations concerning certain restructuring plans for other financial institutions in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We had been working on this draft restructuring plan from the time the government presented us with the document until last Sunday, when the Irish Government decided to ask for a programme making use of the different mechanisms to support Member States in the euro area with financial difficulties. Now, due account should be paid to the restructuring plan for Anglo in the ongoing negotiations on this programme. Hopefully, the Irish programme will be agreed and adopted in the coming days. I very much hope so.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this framework, I can give you some more precise answers on the Anglo Irish Bank restructuring plan presented by the Irish Government that will be considered by my services pending a decision. I hope this will take place as soon as possible after the adoption of the programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">In any case, I must say that I very much hope that the adoption and implementation of the programme will lead to a more favourable climate for tackling Ireland’s financial and economic problems. Hopefully, the sound and strong fundamentals of the Irish economy will receive very good treatment, taking into account the need to restructure the financial sector that is the origin of the problems in your country.</p>

      <p sl="en">I thank the Commissioner for that response. This word ‘restructuring’ is being bandied about a lot outside the House. Could the Commissioner tell the House if he sees any possibility for a takeover or merger of part of Anglo Irish Bank with any other entity as a possible contribution to this, or does he anticipate that the bank will eventually be wound down? In that case, will the Irish taxpayers get some, or all, of their money back? What is the Commissioner’s view on that?</p>

      <p sl="en">With regard to the specific issue of Anglo, is it the view of the Commission that Anglo is different to the existing clearing banks, as we call them in Ireland, like Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and so on?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, with regard to the clarification that he was talking about, is this also linked into the proposal coming forward from the government in Ireland tomorrow with regard to the banking finance facility which is being discussed with the IMF and with the European Central Bank?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-545" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, given that the negotiations on the programme that has been requested are ongoing during these days and hours, I cannot go into details. What I can tell Mr Mitchell is that these restructuring plans for the financial institutions in Ireland, and in general, the programme to finance the financial needs of Ireland at these difficult times, will hopefully have the positive outcome of putting an end to this very difficult and challenging situation in order to put the Irish economy back on the path of recovery and sustainable growth, as was the case in the past. Ireland was one of the best examples of economic success in the euro area and in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the way to tell Irish taxpayers that their money which is now being used for this restructuring, together with financing that hopefully will come after the adoption of the programme from the two European mechanisms, plus the IMF cooperation in this programme, will be returned to them as the positive result of a successful solution to the present Irish problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">I cannot go into the details. I also ask for your understanding on this. What I can say is that there are other financial institutions, other Irish financial institutions, under the restructuring plans being negotiated, or that have been analysed by the Commission. You have seen our State aid rules competences. In the case of Bank of Ireland, we adopted a positive decision on the restructuring plan. In the case of the Allied Irish Bank, we are also negotiating the conditions of the restructuring plan. In the case of two building societies, EBS and INBS, we are also considering the restructuring of these financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say that in two cases, the Anglo Irish Bank and the INBS building society, we are working on a winding-down scenario. In the other cases, the restructuring will hopefully put those financial institutions in the market in better conditions, in viable conditions, after their restructuring is decided and implemented.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 21 by Georgios Papastamkos (H-0519/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Creating a common European conscience</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The creation of a common European conscience among EU citizens is vital if the enterprise of European unification is to survive. Given that mobility among those working in the cultural and arts sectors is the most effective way of forging a common European identity, what specific measures will the Commission take to encourage exchanges of experience and knowledge among European artists, establish a funding programme solely for artistic events in the EU and promote the administrative streamlining and financial support of cross-border artistic cooperation programmes?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-547" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Androulla Vassiliou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Commission agrees completely with the honourable Member as regards the huge importance of cross-border mobility of those working in the cultural and arts sectors. We, too, are making efforts to eliminate obstacles to their mobility.</p>
      <p sl="el">These efforts include coordination of social security, passport visa rules for artists from third countries, taxation and, of course, better information on mobility issues. Experts in the cultural sector are debating how to promote mobility, in working parties where the Member States and the cultural sector are represented, with a view to applying the objectives of the European Agenda for Culture.</p>
      <p sl="el">Under the Culture programme (2007-2013), the Commission is supporting projects and activities which promote cross-border mobility of those working in the cultural sector, encourage the transnational circulation of artistic and cultural works and foster intercultural dialogue. In 2009, approximately 80% of the projects funded by the Commission focused on the circulation of cultural works and the mobility of those working in the cultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, the Commission is still making an effort, as I said, to facilitate access to the programme. The programme guide, the calendar, which is for the period 2008 to 2013, good examples of projects and the cultural contact points in each country all help to simplify access. The experience acquired to date will be useful in developing procedures for future culture programmes.</p>
      <p sl="el">Following an initiative passed by Parliament, the Commission also applied pilot projects to encourage mobility of artists, both in 2008 and 2009. The aim of these projects is to give European artists a chance to extend the scope of their activities and to reach a new public, as well as to exchange experiences and learn from each other in order to further their career.</p>
      <p sl="el">The results of these pilot projects will be input into future culture programmes and are, of course, of help to the working parties of Member State experts within the framework of the open method of coordination. In the long term, everything I have just mentioned will help to forge a common European conscience among the citizens of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Tax burden in Greece</p>
      <p sl="unknown">By signing the memorandum of understanding, Greece has placed itself at the forefront in Europe when it comes to basic taxation, with the result that Greece now has the third highest rate of VAT, the third highest tax on fuel, the third highest rate of social security contributions and one of the highest rates of business taxation and nominal taxes. The imposition of this tax burden in Greece, combined with parallel cuts in salaries and pensions, is not leading to the anticipated increase in revenue. On the contrary, it is worsening the recession and stifling the market, increasing the level of poverty, particularly with regard to basic needs, making it difficult for wage earners and pensioners to meet their living expenses and leading to the closure of hundreds of businesses.</p>

      <p sl="en">As the honourable Member is aware, Greece has introduced a number of tax policy measures to reduce its deficit. This economic adjustment programme was agreed with the Commission, the IMF and the ECB. It conditioned the EUR 110 billion financing that is being provided by the euro area Member States and the IMF.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 6 August 2010, a report was submitted by the Greek Government to the Council and the Commission discussing the implementation of those tax measures, as well as of wide-ranging structural reforms. The honourable Member can refer to the communication from the Commission to the Council of 19 August 2010 for a detailed and thorough assessment of the measures adopted in the first half of 2010 by Greece to comply with Council Decision 2010/320/EC of 10 May 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">This assessment mainly concludes that the budgetary execution shows positive developments over the first half of 2010 with a deficit declining faster than planned, mainly as a result of lower than expected expenditure. Moreover, within the framework of the planned fiscal adjustment, the choice of the mix between expenditure and revenue measures made by the Greek Government takes into account important social and economic aspects, in particular, in terms of potential complementarities with a package of structural reforms and measures to improve the micro-economic environment and the functioning of the public sector.</p>

      <p sl="el">Commissioner, I should like to ask the European Commission the following supplementary question: as a party to the memorandum, what recommendations does it intend to make to Greece, bearing in mind that the current high level of taxation has already resulted in the closure or relocation of businesses to other, more tax-lenient, neighbouring countries and, at the same time, in a reduction in incoming investment capital, the return on capital and entrepreneurship in general.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to come back to an issue raised in my honourable friend’s question. With the increase and the tax policy being applied by the government based on the memorandum, inflation has rocketed in Greece and is now over 6%, the highest rate in Europe. Mr Rehn agreed, in answer to a question, that high inflation is due to the increase in the VAT rate, in other words, to fiscal policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would like to ask you if the Commission believes that these tax measures really have led to the spiralling inflation that is undermining the competitiveness of the Greek economy and what measures you are proposing to the Greek Government to address this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Actually, the questions are rather similar and here I have to emphasise that in the case of Greece, we had a huge deficit which needed to be addressed. We all know that, in addressing the deficit, there are no miracle solutions. The Member State has either to reduce expenditure, increase taxes or both in order to consolidate its fiscal position. The Commission’s attitude to this is very clear: that it is the Member State which has to choose the measures to address the shortfall. Greece chose a mixture of measures on both the expenditure side and the revenue side.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission cannot dictate to the Member States what specific taxes they can increase or reduce. It is the Member State which decides on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">So far, the Greek programme is functioning well and I believe that the Greek authorities will take all necessary future measures to fix their fiscal position.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 28 by Jim Higgins (H-0521/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Fraud and customs losses due to cigarette smuggling</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Is the Commission concerned that there is an alarming level of smuggling of illegal cigarettes into countries like Ireland from third countries? The effect of this is that the EU is losing out on customs revenue, which is an important source of finance, given that it makes up 15% of the EU budget. Member States are also losing out on excise duties. Does the Commission have any plans to enable, or indeed force, Member States to increase their checks at external EU borders, in order to tackle the issue of customs fraud?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-563" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">In relation to border controls, customs controls must balance the protection of a range of EU financial, safety and security interests with the interests of legitimate traders.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, a Community risk management framework was developed enabling customs controls for security and safety to be carried out on the basis of common risk criteria and standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the EU, 1.5 million tonnes of sea cargo and 12 million tonnes of air cargo are checked each year. Under Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Member States’ customs services are responsible for the application of the EU legislation concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, they are in charge of organising customs controls at physical frontiers and elsewhere on the basis of risk management techniques as specified in the EU’s Customs Code.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to cigarette smuggling, the Commission plays an active role in helping Member States to tackle the phenomenon of international cigarette smuggling and to dismantle the criminal gangs responsible for this trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, the European Anti-Fraud Office assists law enforcement authorities throughout the European Union with their operational cases and coordinates major customs and criminal investigations with the Member States and third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Using the provisions of European mutual assistance in customs matters and a number of agreements concluded between the EU and third countries, OLAF organises joint customs operations between EU Member States and with third countries aimed at targeting specific problems, such as Operation Matthew II, targeting road traffic on the eastern border, or Operation Sirocco, focused on deep-sea container transports from China to the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, OLAF provides financial support to Member States from the Hercule II programme for measures specifically targeting cigarette smuggling, such as the purchase of specialist x-ray scanning equipment to be used at border points and the organisation of regional actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, cooperation agreements were signed with British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco Limited in 2010, and agreements were signed with Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International in 2004 and 2007 respectively. These legally binding agreements provide a comprehensive set of measures designed to limit the presence of the products of these companies on the illicit tobacco market.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive reply. As he said, tobacco smuggling is a very lucrative business. There is a lot of ingenuity, they are perfectly wrapped, perfectly presented and perfectly labelled.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recently, I met with the head of the customs authorities in Ireland in Dublin Castle, and she told me that one in every five cigarettes – 20% of the cigarettes smoked in Ireland, a small country – actually comes via China, and that when they actually seized them and analysed them, they found a mixture of tobacco and canine excrement. We really need to tighten up our regulations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome international cooperation, but we still have an awful lot of work to do. I would basically ask that OLAF, the EU anti-fraud agency, needs to be given increased resources.</p>

      <p sl="en">Next month, I am going to China to discuss, among other issues related to customs matters, the issue of cigarette smuggling. We are implementing a number of measures, working together with the Chinese authorities, in order to address this issue. It is true, as you rightly pointed out, that China is still a major source of counterfeited cigarettes, so we have to work in close cooperation with them in order to tackle this issue. I have to emphasise that the Chinese authorities are ready for this cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission make a statement confirming that the proposed CCCTB initiative will not impact upon the ability of Member States to set their individual corporation tax rate?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-567" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Do you mean these three questions on the CCCTB?</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has no plans to make proposals on corporate tax rates. Differences in rates allow a certain degree of tax competition to be maintained in the internal market. In addition, fair tax competition based on rates offers more transparency and allows Member States to consider both their market competitiveness and budgetary needs in fixing their tax rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to the issue of corporate tax bases, conversely, the Commission has been working for some time on a proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base. This initiative is included in the Commission work programme for 2011 as a strategic initiative to tap the potential of the single market for growth. It is also quoted as a key proposal in the Single Market Act, which was adopted on 27 October 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently, the Commission’s plan is to adopt a proposal by the end of the first quarter of 2011. The CCCTB is a common system of rules for calculating the tax base of companies; it has no bearing on tax rates. Member States will continue to decide their own corporate tax rates. The Commission believes that progressing with the CCCTB is the appropriate solution to tackling cross-border fiscal impediments to growth in a comprehensive manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently, the existence of 27 highly disparate corporate tax systems in the EU means that companies are faced with significant tax obstacles and an administrative burden which discourage, if not impede, their activities in the single market and negatively affect their competitiveness, in particular, in the case of SMEs. Such a highly fragmented landscape gives rise to significant market distortions and barriers and creates considerable compliance costs.</p>

    <intervention id="2-568" speaker_id="28116" name="Marian Harkin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply. I understand perfectly what he says about the difference between tax rates and tax bases, but one of the issues for companies – particularly for foreign direct investment coming into Europe – is the ability for those companies to know in advance, with certainty, the tax implications of a transaction. If part of that calculation is sales by destination, that cannot be determined beforehand, so there is real uncertainty for those companies. I think that acts as a disincentive for foreign direct investment. I have many other questions but I know we are tight on time so, if the Commissioner could answer that one, I would be happy.</p>

    <intervention id="2-570" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">We can disagree on certain principles of taxation, which is always a rather sensitive matter. The biggest support for the CCCTB comes from businesses; we have clear evidence of this. I understand this because, when dealing with 27 different Member States with 27 different corporate tax systems, it is really a mess for them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning foreign direct investment, if we are able to agree on this proposal, we have to do so unanimously. If we are able to agree, this will facilitate foreign direct investment because foreign investors who want to invest, not in one Member State but in several, will be able to deal with one corporate tax system instead of several corporate tax systems, and that is a big advantage for foreign investors. Throughout bilateral discussions with potential investors, they really emphasise the issue of 27 corporate tax systems as an impediment to facilitating foreign direct investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, when we are talking about the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, we are not talking about tax rates. It is clear that this has nothing to do with the sovereignty of Member States in deciding tax matters because, even within the CCCTB environment, they will be able to decide on corporate tax rates, based on their needs, their social systems, public services and so on. So the proposal itself does not reduce the sovereignty of Member States in tax matters.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, honourable Members – if I have understood correctly this time – it is on behalf of Lady Ashton, our High Representative, that I have the honour of taking the floor before you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union continues to monitor on a daily basis, through its delegation in Beijing and its bilateral embassies, the situation with respect to Mr Liu Xiaobo, Nobel Peace Prize winner, his wife Liu Xia, as well as their friends and lawyers. Their situation is receiving our constant attention. The house arrest that Mrs Liu Xia and many human rights activists in China have been under since 8 October worries us as much as it disappoints us, and we condemn it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the European Union has not waited for Mr Liu Xiaobo to receive this prestigious award to remind the Chinese Government of its international commitments regarding respect for freedom of expression. In this particular case, the European Union has always considered that Charter 08 was a peaceful manifesto, calling for more respect for human rights in China. What is more, the Union has published four public declarations since December 2008, calling for Liu Xiaobo to be released.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our position could not be any different when the Nobel Committee announced on 8 October, entirely independently need I point out, its decision. We have congratulated Liu Xiaobo via the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs, Lady Ashton, and via the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and we have stressed how important his release is to us. We regret that the Chinese authorities have not heeded the calls that the international community has been eager to amplify.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is regrettable that the European Union should take note, once again and with concern, of the intimidation and house arrest that Mr Liu Xiaobo’s wife, Mrs Liu Xia, has been subjected to for the last six weeks. We deplore just as vigorously the threats, surveillance and ban on leaving the country, as well as the arrests that many of Liu Xiaobo’s relatives and friends have been subjected to since he was awarded the Nobel Prize.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the European Union will continue with consistency and determination the efforts that it has undertaken for nearly two years now to see Liu Xiaobo freed so that he can exercise his rights in full and take part, as he would like to, in the public debate that he initiated in China with Charter 08. We carry on hoping that he will be able to collect the Nobel Peace Prize in person on 10 December. We call on China to remove the restrictions on freedom of movement and of expression to which his wife Liu Xia and many of his friends are subjected.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Minister, honourable Members, the Commission fully supports the Belgian Presidency’s statement. The European Union has repeatedly maintained that it considers Charter 08 to be a legitimate exercise of freedom of expression and, as the Presidency has just noted, the European Union has reiterated several times the serious concerns it has about Liu Xiaobo’s arrest, trial and imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Both President Barroso and the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative, Cathy Ashton, have welcomed the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo on 8 October. However, the Commission regrets the fact that the Chinese authorities have reacted by putting his wife, Mrs Liu Xia, under house arrest, and by restricting freedom of movement for many of his friends.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission reiterates its call on China to release Liu Xiaobo immediately from prison and to lift his wife’s house arrest order, as well as to remove all restrictions on his friends’ freedom of movement. The Commission, as mentioned by the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative, Cathy Ashton, in her statement, hopes that Liu Xiaobo will be able to collect the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize in person, in Oslo.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, ten months ago in this House, I was saying that the 11-year prison sentence given to Liu Xiaobo by the Chinese Government simply for expressing his views was symptomatic of the Chinese authorities stepping up their campaign against human rights activists.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At this very moment, I believe that awarding the Nobel Prize to Liu Xiaobo is an appropriate act to emphasise that, although China has made great progress in economic and sometimes in social matters, the real sign of progress is respect for human rights. A country can be admired for its economic achievements. However, it will not gain the respect of other countries if it restricts freedom instead of protecting it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Indeed, I find the actions taken by the Chinese Government in an attempt to intimidate the countries invited to attend the ceremony extremely worrying. It is just as worrying that some countries have given in to this blackmail.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are dealing with an unacceptable situation because a country is taking a stance in its international relations against one of its own citizens. In fact, China would gain, as I was saying, the respect of the other countries if it allowed Liu Xiaobo now to go to Oslo to receive his prize instead of making these threats against other countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the Chinese authorities’ attitude seems, for the time being, to be much more hard line than that of the Soviets because not even a member of Liu Xiaobo’s family or his lawyer is able to get to Oslo. This is why I welcome the initiative proposed by Lech Wałęsa to represent the Chinese dissident symbolically in Oslo. However, I hope that the Chinese authorities will decide at the last moment to release Liu Xiaobo.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, tonight, we in the Socialist and Democrat Group give our full support to this European Parliament demand that Liu Xiaobo is allowed to go to Oslo, and does not earn a different prize as the first laureate or laureate’s representative in its one hundred year history to be unable to be present to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Arrested for taking part in demonstrations, banned from teaching, sent for re-education and now imprisoned for seeking to exercise freedom of expression, the Chinese called Liu Xiaobo a criminal whilst the rest of the world awards him the accolade for peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">I went to China personally on behalf of this House and saw that there are people ready to enter into dialogue with us on issues of labour rights and corporate social responsibility. But the fact remains that, when this Parliament’s Human Rights Subcommittee sought visas from China, no reply was ever given; and when the EU pressed for a meeting of our human rights dialogue with China, the Chinese deliberately offered a date between Christmas this year and the New Year. It now looks almost certain that there will not be a meeting under this Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not serious. All who wish to express solidarity tonight with Liu, his wife Liu Xia and all prisoners of conscience in China, should recognise that the rest of the world has too often put trade interests with China before our mutual obligations on human rights. This is exemplified by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who this month took a 48-strong trade delegation to Beijing but failed to include anyone to represent an interest or expertise in poverty reduction, environmental degradation or labour rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The truth is that five socially conscious individuals who make up the awards committee in Norway have arguably done more than this European Union, the US or the rest of the international community to put pressure on the Chinese Government to reform. Let us remember that Andrei Sakharov, Lech Wałęsa and Nelson Mandela were all Nobel laureates who once lived in repressive countries which were ultimately transformed, and tonight express our hope that Liu Xiaobo may join this list not simply in the China of today but in a China where human rights are fully respected one day in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this debate in a sense catalyses several years of effort by many Members who are present here, and others, to try and focus attention on the real China. The sense of unity being displayed by Council and Commission, and by the diplomatic representatives in Oslo, concerning the ceremony which may take place on 10 December, is encouraging. Of course we hope that Liu Xiaobo will be present, but it is unlikely.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we have seen in the last few weeks, in diplomatic terms, is a car crash organised by Beijing. It is one of the most disastrous, cack-handed episodes in the history of diplomacy. But at the heart of this lies the clash between the free world and what remains a dictatorship.</p>
      <p sl="de">On my last visit to Beijing, all the people with whom I had contact were subsequently arrested, imprisoned and, in some cases, tortured. There are between seven and eight million people imprisoned across China, there are at least 5 000 executions a year. I have seen a list of more than 3 400 people who, in the last 10 years, have died under torture in that regime for their religious convictions.</p>
      <p sl="de">In sum, this is a terror state. We want to congratulate the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for its courage in making this award. I hope that in Oslo, on 10 December, should the ceremony take place, we have the most muscular presence on behalf of the European Union, standing by its foreign policy priorities of human rights and democracy. The world’s most populous country deserves what we enjoy in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Liu Xiaobo has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and we are very pleased about this because it is a demonstration of the universality of human rights, which lies at the heart of our political self-understanding. We were also happy to see that our pleasure was shared by many countries throughout the world and also by many people in China.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Chinese Government has responded harshly to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize. It has reacted excessively harshly, both internally and externally. I believe that this is regrettable. It does not seem to me to be a good idea to acknowledge this negative response, if I can express it like this, by caricaturing China’s current position. With all due respect, I must make it clear, although I agree with the previous speaker about supporting the call for the release of Liu Xiaobo, that I think it is not only wrong, but also harmful to describe the China of today as a terrorist state. In my opinion, this is not true, nor does it help the positive relationship which it is important for us to have with China.</p>
      <p sl="de">China will have to accept that we support universal human rights, because we will continue to do so. However, we must not confuse this with a strategy of confrontation. No one would benefit from this, least of all the supporters of human rights within China.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have already said and, in summing up, I will say again that China has reacted excessively harshly to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize. It is attempting to exert diplomatic pressure on other countries not to attend the ceremony in Oslo. That is simply unacceptable. Parliament will not accept this and, therefore, I am pleased that the President has already agreed that the European Parliament will be represented in Oslo.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I come from a country which, only 20 years ago, was ruled by a Communist dictatorship. I had the misfortune to live in that system and I know what the situation is like in such a country. Indeed, I remember how important the voice of what, at the time, we called ‘the free world’ was for us then. I mean the voice coming from here – from Western Europe and the United States. I remember how, at the time, it created the feeling that what we were doing there – fighting for liberty and democracy – made sense.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that, today, we are under an obligation to help people such as Liu Xiaobo. Besides, he consciously makes reference to the experience of democracy and of those who fought for democracy in Central Europe. The name Charter 08 is, after all, a conscious reference to Charter 77. I think that all of us here may differ in our economic or political views, but on questions of human rights we should be completely united. I hope that in this House we will be just that.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, following the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, Liu Xiaobo is now the only Nobel laureate who is incarcerated, in prison. From the speeches that we have already heard from the Council and here in Parliament, all of us here hope that he will be able to receive this Nobel Prize in freedom, or that he will be freed as soon as possible. That would honour the person that he is: committed to the peaceful transformation of China; a literary critic, teacher and author, who has always sought to bring freedom of expression and democracy to China through the world of ideas and words. The document Charter 08, for which Liu Xiaobo was imprisoned, is, as Mr Chastel has already reminded us, a constructive and peaceful one, which caused Liu Xiaobo to be incarcerated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know what we have to do now: work towards the release of Liu Xiaobo and all China’s political prisoners. We must also work towards the release of Liu Xia, Liu Xiaobo’s wife, who is under house arrest, and bring an end to the siege of their family, friends and lawyers. For this to be achieved, China will have to ask itself why, for example, it responded to the recent release of Aung San Suu Kyi by calling her an important political figure, even though it does not recognise that many people across the world believe that Liu Xiaobo, too, is an important political figure. However, above all, China needs to realise what a sad, awful figure it cut with its bitter worldwide diplomatic offensive to prevent the world’s high diplomatic representatives being present in Oslo for the Nobel Prize ceremony. Clearly, the people who run China can want to live in a fantasy world, and we understand why it is that they want to live in a fantasy world, where there is no opposition. What they cannot do is want to force us to live according to the rules of that fantasy world. That, I believe, is fundamentally our main issue. It is very easy for us in this Chamber to bring our indignation before the Chinese authorities and put all our complaints to them, but I think that first, we should look at the European authorities and start with our own governments. When my country, Portugal, was receiving a visit from high Chinese dignitaries recently, the government steered a demonstration by Amnesty International away from the place that the entourage was going to pass through to somewhere a few hundred metres away; the same thing happened in France, where a demonstration was moved to the Eiffel Tower. Moreover, as we have already seen, David Cameron recently travelled to China, very interested in doing business with the country, but forgetting to make a single forceful reference to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that there are double standards here in Europe. We say a few passing words about Liu Xiaobo, but our governments are interested in doing business. We must therefore start the housecleaning here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is hard for us to imagine the sheer physical and moral courage required by Mr Liu to stand up against the murderous tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party. Those of us who enjoy the most basic freedoms of free speech and free assembly and democratic politics have a duty to speak out on behalf of Mr Liu and those like him. Mr Liu wants nothing more for China than those basic freedoms and civil rights that we take for granted.</p>
      <p sl="en">The values that he espouses are the best hope for freedom, peace and democracy for China and the world and it is fitting that he has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his efforts and his sacrifices. He wants nothing more than democratic reforms and the end of one-party Communist rule in China. It should surprise no one that the Chinese Communist Party prevents him or his family representative from collecting the award.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Chinese Communist Party is a party of murderous gangsters that has no more purpose than the continuation of its own existence. China is a big and powerful country and it is inevitable that our governments must maintain political, diplomatic and trading relations with them. The Chinese Communist Party warns foreign governments not to attend the ceremony. Our governments should send representatives and show their and our support for Mr Liu and the Chinese democracy movement as a whole. I represent many Chinese exiles in London and I am pleased to offer what small support I can by speaking out on behalf of Mr Liu and their democratic aspirations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is very good indeed that Parliament and the Commission have decided that the situation of Liu Xiaobo should be discussed at a plenary sitting of the European Parliament. It is a pity there are so few of us here for such a debate. After all, the international community, of which we are one of the most important members, should be united in such situations and should support the fight for respect for human rights together, because solidarity is the key word in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In 1989, when my country finally defeated the communist dictatorship, Liu Xiaobo was protesting in Tiananmen Square, demanding exactly the democratic freedoms which were shortly to be enjoyed by almost the whole of Europe. He has not given up his efforts – despite having spent years in prison, he signed an appeal for democratisation of the country, for which he was sentenced to a further 11 years’ imprisonment. Just like Liu, our leader, Lech Wałęsa, strove for a bloodless transition and for freedom. We enjoyed the support of democratic countries. Wałęsa, too, was not able to receive his Nobel Peace Prize in person, but even so, that prize was the hope of liberty to us Poles. That Nobel Prize became a catalyst of change.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today is a good time to draw the attention of world opinion to people just such as Liu Xiaobo. We must not forget that apart from such leading figures as himself, there are many others who are not being spoken about, for example, the human rights activist, Mao Hengfeng, who is currently in a re-education/labour camp precisely for protesting against the imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo. The European Union should attach the highest importance to human rights in contacts with China. This should be a priority for meetings such as the European Union-China summit which was held on 6 October. I want to express my disappointment at the omission of this fundamental matter. We must show we are not blind to human rights, and an opportunity to do this will be the award ceremony for the Nobel Prize in Oslo, at which, I hope, the whole world and all ambassadors will be present.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo has been a consistent and courageous human rights defender since the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Parliament therefore joins Baroness Ashton and the Commission in demanding that he be freed immediately so he can go to Oslo in December to receive the Nobel Prize, and demands freedom of movement for his wife, family and friends, who have been especially restricted since the announcement of the Nobel Prize on 8 October.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Chinese authorities’ threats and intimidating manoeuvres to prevent the ceremony in Oslo are a disgrace. No government that succumbed to this despicable blackmail would be worthy of respect. China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and, according to the UN Charter, it has special responsibilities to respect and promote respect for human rights domestically and abroad. China has already done much for some of the economic, social and cultural rights of millions of Chinese, whom it has dragged out of poverty and penury, but it cannot stop there. It must respect and promote respect for the civil and political rights of its citizens: if it does not, its own development will eventually be hindered.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Liu Xiaobo is not a criminal: he is a brave and committed citizen who brings prestige across the world to China and the Chinese people, and of whom the Chinese people should only be proud. Beijing must free Liu Xiaobo, his wife and his friends; it must free the Sakharov laureate, Hu Jia, and all the other brave Chinese citizens who dare to fight for democracy, for freedom and for their most basic rights. If they are not freed, it is China that will lose prestige. It is the Chinese regime that has shown itself incapable of turning its country into a respectable and influential power on the international stage.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, awarding the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo is testimony to the personal cost of human rights advocacy in China today. It is imperative that he and all other human rights defenders in China be released immediately. There are other cases pending. I remain painfully aware of the situation of Dhondup Wangchen, the Tibetan film maker, who suffers from hepatitis B and is in need of urgent medical attention in prison.</p>
      <p sl="en">The decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo must be considered as strong support for the struggle for freedom of expression in China. It also serves, however, as a reminder to the international community of the need for reform in China. Even Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, has warned that China may lose what it has already achieved through economic restructuring if there is no consequent political restructuring – and, colleagues, he was censured by the Chinese media.</p>
      <p sl="en">Delaying such reform has a terrible human cost. In addition, pressuring countries to stay away from the Peace Prize ceremony shows that China has not yet matured into an international actor. China is a superpower and it should start acting like one responsibly.

      <p sl="it">Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who won the Nobel Peace Prize, has been a great defender of the application of these values during his lifetime. During the course of his long and non-violent battle, he has always stressed how all these rights are constantly violated in China by violent repressive methods. He has had first-hand experience of being sentenced to forced imprisonment without the chance of a fair trial or of communicating with the outside world.</p>

Above all, this is due to the fact that we have a different understanding of the importance of human rights, freedom and free speech. The European Union has taken the responsibility for promoting these values throughout the world and, therefore, for supporting human rights defenders in other states, such as Liu Xiaobo in China, so that they can bring about changes in the situation in their own countries. For this reason, I believe that it is very important that Parliament, but also the Council and the Commission, clearly commit to attending the award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize. Heidi Hautala will be taking part as an individual, but I hope very much that the European governments, the Council, the Belgian Presidency and the Commission will be represented at the highest level.

That was the first thing I wanted to share with you today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the European Union has been holding a regular dialogue on the issue of human rights with China for 15 years, and although there is always more one could do in this respect, we attach great importance to this task, which seems to us more pertinent than ever at a time when people are speaking out in China and are calling for the scope of human rights to be broadened. Inspired by mutual respect and a deep understanding of the Chinese political context, we will continue to raise the universal issues of human rights, in particular, the case of Mr Liu Xiaobo, Nobel Peace Prize winner, with the Chinese authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, I am pleased that you are here today to answer questions. On 18 May, the European Parliament adopted with a large majority a resolution to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP). Of course, it has not been possible for you to implement this resolution yet, but I would like to ask you, Mr Cioloş, to take into consideration all the demands made in this motion for a resolution when you begin restructuring agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, I have to point out one fly in the ointment. I have just had a discussion with a group of farmers who were concerned that your proposals for the first pillar, Mr Cioloş, would not reduce the amount of red tape, but could instead lead to a huge increase in bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union cannot be held responsible for every piece of red tape, Mr Cioloş. A large proportion of the responsibility lies with the Member States. This is why I am asking you to ensure that we can work together on the forthcoming reform so that it is structured in such a way that it can be implemented with as little administrative and supervisory effort as possible. This will allow farmers to focus on their main job, in other words, producing food, rather than requiring them to check the current legislation to find out what they need to be aware of before they do anything out in their fields or their barns.</p>
      <p sl="de">In no other agricultural area in the world are farmers burdened with so many requirements and regulations as in the European Union. You are not yet responsible for this, Mr Cioloş. You have the chance to be the first Commissioner – before you eventually step down, and I do not know when that will happen – who can say that during his period of office, the amount of bureaucracy has been reduced rather than increased. As the rapporteur for agricultural reform, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work together with us to find a solution, so that this goal can be achieved.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-594" speaker_id="96959" name="George Lyon" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, it is good to see you here with us to tonight. Clearly, simplification and stripping out the bureaucracy from the CAP is a key objective of the next reform, because certainly back in Scotland, many farmers are frustrated and angry about the bureaucracy and the disproportionate nature of the penalty system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Public money has to be spent wisely and properly audited, and we do not dispute that whatsoever, but there is a lack of proportionality in the current penalty system both at Member State level and at farmer level as well. That is something that needs to be addressed in the reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Scotland, farmers are currently being punished for small mistakes with very, very large fines in some instances. Since May, the inspections have been ramped up and swingeing penalties are being handed out. The Scottish Government, I am afraid, blame you, Commissioner, for that particular measure – for the ramping up of the inspections and the penalty systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another explanation, however, might be that the European Commission auditors were due to come and inspect Scotland both in October and last week in November. It may well be that the Scottish Government were panicking slightly and that the huge fines and draconian penalties that have been put in place in the last three or four months are the response to worries that all might not be well when the auditors arrived in Scotland and carried out their inspection.</p>
      <p sl="en">They have also looked across the water to our colleagues in Northern Ireland – I am sure my colleague, Jim Nicholson, might say one or two words about that – and looked at the fate of the government there which is facing a huge fine for the misinterpretation of eligible lands. That may well lie behind the measures taken in Scotland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, in your wind-up speech, can you clarify if it is indeed you that is behind and is responsible for the new draconian regime in Scotland, and can you confirm when we will know the outcome of the auditors’ inspections that have taken place in October and November of this year?</p>

    <intervention id="2-595" speaker_id="1318" name="James Nicholson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to apologise, because it is not normal that I do not turn up when I am supposed to speak. I apologise most profusely for that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The House will be aware that my colleague Mr Ashworth’s report on simplification of the CAP was adopted in this House last May. It advocated the removal of unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy imposed upon European farmers which, in my opinion, has become over-burdensome and seriously impinges upon the time that they would rather spend actually farming.</p>
      <p sl="en">One central feature of this report was that a reformed CAP should be simplified and the policy streamlined. I fear, however, that what we are getting is not that. We are going to get more bureaucracy, more red tape – and when you talk about greening the first pillar, what do you mean? You mean more bureaucracy and red tape; more paperwork for the farmer and more inspections, which is what they do not want. We want one inspection of every farm; that should be enough anywhere to inspect.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say to the Commissioner: you have enough tools in the box at the moment with cross-compliance; we do not need more. We do not need any more over-emphasis on this particular position. I am appealing to you on behalf of the people who are trying to produce the food. We talk about food security in Europe; if you want food security, we are giving it to you – we are giving you food safety. Let the farmers produce the food.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I comment on what Mr Lyon just said? My farmers in Northern Ireland are facing a reduction of EUR 60 million because of mapping. No one would argue that the maps that were created many years ago are totally perfect. But no one will tell me that, south of the border from me in the Republic of Ireland, the maps are any better, or that they are any better in Italy – maps that were created years ago. Why are we having this? Why are we having these draconian measures placed upon our farmers when they do not need it or want it, and when all they want to do is produce good food?</p>

    <intervention id="2-596" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me firstly to provide answers to your written question regarding the simplification of the common agricultural policy, an important subject, as I have repeatedly said since I became Commissioner, and which we will take into consideration for future legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to start with the first part of your question: what has the Commission done until now to make things easier for farmers? I think that if we look at what has been done these last few years, the answer is clear: it has already done a lot to make things easier, and it has already put in place many measures to make things easier for farmers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In March 2009, the Commission presented the communication ‘A simplified CAP for Europe – a success for all’. This communication highlights the activities that have taken place over the last few years and provides information on the reduced administrative burden obtained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not wish to repeat every element from this communication, but I would like to expand on a few examples.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, the adoption in 2007 of the Council regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets has led to a substantial reduction in red tape in the application framework of the European legislation on the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Because of its technical features, this single common market organisation did not intend to change the underlying policy but to harmonise the provisions, thus making CAP rules simpler to manage, lighter, more accessible and less difficult to apply.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Simplification was also one of the main reasons that motivated the Commission’s ‘health check’ proposals. The regulation adopted in 2009 simplifies the provisions of the single payment system, thereby improving the effectiveness of the 2003 CAP reform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, to illustrate the progress accomplished in the farming sector, I would also like to mention the action programme to reduce the administrative burden in the European Union. In the context of this programme, several assessments have been conducted. The outcome of these assessments shows that the administrative burden in the farming sector has been cut by 36%, which is much more than the programme’s general target of 25%.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last year, my predecessor presented the first response from the Commission services to the list of 39 simplification suggestions that had been proposed by 13 Member States in April 2009. Some of the 39 suggestions were implemented at the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010. Others can be found in the ‘simplification’ package that has just been adopted by the Commission with reference to direct payments and rural development, and regulations were presented to the Council and to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the second pillar, the Commission has launched a study on the administrative burden that stems from implementing rural development programmes for beneficiaries. The study concentrated on two categories of measures: agro-environmental and farm modernisation. The results of this study will be used in our reflection on the CAP for the period after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To end on this first point, I would also like to inform you that the programme is ongoing, and that it includes time spent on a farm for staff of the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development. This programme, also called ‘Harvest experience’, helps us to have direct contact with what is really happening on the ground and to use that experience in the decisions we prepare.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now to the second part of your question: how will the Commission take into account Parliament’s suggestions in its work on the post-2013 CAP? Here, too, I can assure you that these questions are of concern to me and that we are going to take into account all the analyses that we have already conducted with a view to simplification, but also the proposals that we will be making, which do not move in the direction of more red tape but rather in the direction of more assurance for the taxpayer that the money is well used.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this point too, I am open to any technical proposal that you wish to make. In early December, I will go before your fellow Members from the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is also asking what the Commission is doing to ensure that public money is well spent. The Commission, in this case, can only apply regulations that have been adopted by the Council, often after considering Parliament’s opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not the Commission that is adding administrative tasks. The Commission only applies existing Council regulations. On that, I can assure you that in future, we will not be making proposals that complicate things unnecessarily; on the contrary, we will be making proposals that make the CAP more credible in content. As for farmers, their main role is, as I have already said, agricultural production; they are the ones who work with these natural resources and it is also because of this activity that a portion of CAP funding is allocated to that policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to what we plan to do after 2013, I would like to inform you that in parallel to preparing the legislative package for the CAP after 2013, I decided to create a high-level technical group with the Commission and Member States in order to ensure that this legislative package will not produce more red tape, but instead will simplify things wherever possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Lyon said, often the red tape encountered by the farmer on the ground does not only come from the Commission. You know that management is shared with Member States and we often have applications that are different from one Member State to the other, precisely because of the national administrations. As far as these are concerned, it is not up to the Commission to simplify. As I have already said, the Commission has already simplified things. There is still the need to simplify at Member State level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To answer Mr Lyon’s question regarding Scotland, here too, the Commission is only complying with the regulations that stipulate that for those farmers who do not adhere to the cross-compliance standards, penalties should apply not only in Scotland, but also in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in Europe. Once again, this is a rule that, if we do not comply with it, discredits us in respect of the commitments that farmers make to adhere to European legislation, since cross-compliance is not a standard added by the Commission, by a Member State or by any other body, but stems from European legislation which is reflected in these regulations. Governments will receive more details by early December, when the Commission is to present the findings of its audits.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, you have a good command of the French language and you know my country well. In France, there is an expression that describes something one dreams of but which never materialises, we talk about the Arlésienne .</p>
      <p sl="fr">For farmers, simplification is undoubtedly one of the forms, one of the faces of the Arlésienne . As you have said, the Commission has already taken action to try and simplify procedures and I would like to go into a bit more detail. To my mind, there are two aspects to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, there is everything to do with the requests for aid. I think it should be recognised that there has been an effort to simplify the paperwork during these last few years and months, and we give you credit for that. Secondly, there are the restrictions relating to all the conditions, the never-ending reporting requested from farmers for everything they do: taking a trailer full of manure to a field, using a dose of fertiliser in another field, using a dose of plant protection product in a third field, and if they make a mistake, they are sanctioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with this situation, Commissioner, I believe that we certainly need to find solutions. Last week, while presenting the proposal for the future common agricultural policy, you mentioned a few integrative measures that could be implemented and that could, in fact, lead, through the outcome produced by these measures, to measures that can be controlled by opinion, by farmers as well as by the Commission, measures for which we can be sure of the scientific effect. I have in mind the example of crop rotation. These measures should enable us to simplify the obligations imposed on farmers. This represents a considerable amount of work for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, today as you did last week, you mentioned what is incumbent on Member States and I think you are right. Every year, the Commission controllers visit Member States before visiting the farmers. They go there with a critical eye to find what is not right. Yet could we not change their mission slightly, Commissioner, and ask them to also list – this would be beneficial to the Member States – areas where the Member States are going too far in applying EU legislation? Going too far is to impose on farmers obligations which are pointless in relation to the regulations. By doing so, you would have improved Europe’s image among our fellow citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, the simplification of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is a goal that we have all been proclaiming for years. However, it is still a very long way from being fully achieved, despite the efforts that the Commission has been making, which must be acknowledged. Nevertheless, I should like to make it very clear that, for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, simplification cannot, in any sense, be understood as clearing the way for corner cutting, or for reduced stringency in the control or monitoring of public aid. No pretext may be invoked to get around this crucial requirement of transparency. With the start of new discussions on the post-2013 CAP, we now have an excellent opportunity to achieve this goal. Nonetheless, there will not be significant progress on simplification without simplifying the CAP architecture itself and it is about this that the S&amp;D Group has been expressing its opinions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In April, we published a document advocating the reorganisation of the two pillars and we note with satisfaction that the Commission has accepted some of our suggestions along these lines. I do not understand how it is possible for aid which is not linked to production, and which is subject to similar criteria of an essentially environmental nature – such as direct payments, agro-environmental measures or compensation payments for disadvantaged regions – to be subject to different bureaucratic treatment and controls, and not be included in a single, unified system. I also find it very hard to understand how many of those who talk about simplification are the very ones who are most resistant to changing the current CAP architecture.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, Commissioner, I look forward to the work you are about to do, as well as the production of the guidance document that you have just presented to us. I would also take this opportunity to express my hope that all those who want true simplification demonstrate it by taking part in the discussion that we are about to start on the future of the CAP.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, one of our top priorities as Members of the European Parliament is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legislation and regulations in all the political areas of the European Union. This is the only way in which we can manage taxpayers’ money efficiently and increase the acceptance of our political decisions among the citizens of Europe. For this reason, it is important for farmers to feel the direct effect of simplification measures of this kind in the agricultural sector. Their job is to produce food, not to write books.</p>
      <p sl="de">At a time when local authority budgets are becoming increasingly tight, it is also important for us to reduce the amount of work to be done by their administrative staff. Regulations must be drawn up in such a way that they are not padded out unnecessarily. In addition, we must ensure that the sanctions we impose are in proportion to the breach of regulations. An efficient, long-term policy is characterised by the fact that it places a greater emphasis on advice than it does on punishment. This is the only way that we can give our citizens and our farmers the incentives to implement new findings and to fulfil society’s requirements. We need to take all of this into account when we discuss the future common agricultural policy. We also need to focus more closely on ensuring that there is no duplication of formalities and controls and that forms are only filled out when they provide real added value for the administrative bodies and for the farmers themselves. We must finally learn to work together and not against one another.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of the Green/EFA Group, I congratulate the Commissioner for coming here this evening and I congratulate colleagues, and Mr Ashworth in particular, for the original resolution which has spurred tonight’s discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I would refer you in particular to paragraphs 52 and 53 of the original resolution on transparency of penalties. I think that domestic mischief-making aside, we do have a difficulty across Scotland, and across the EU as a whole, in how our farmers perceive the transparency of enforcement, particularly of cross-compliance. I think that going forward, we need a far greater degree of clarity in terms of what is required and expected of farmers and what the consequences of non-compliance are.</p>
      <p sl="en">Going forward as well, we also need to see a greater degree of understanding, a greater degree of flexibility. Much as I appreciate that you have to deal with the regulations as they are written, we are here to rewrite the regulations – and that is what we are looking forward to doing. There is a world of difference between accident and fraud and presently, as things are implied, farmers are treated more or less the same way in either case, when there is a world of difference in the real world as to how that works.</p>
      <p sl="en">On paragraph 66, in particular, going forward, I would be very grateful for an indication from you, Commissioner, of how you view the call from us for a three-year moratorium on EID – electronic identification of sheep – cross-compliance penalties. We in Scotland are trying to make the technology work, but it is very far from perfect and it would just rub an awful lot of salt into an existing wound to see a non-proportionate approach taken in the cross-compliance of the EID regulations. We are trying to make it work and we have heard you will flexible. I would be grateful for a reassurance tonight that that will be the case.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wrote the original report. In that report, I talked about the challenges confronting agriculture and highlighted the ways in which the common agricultural policy is going to have to change in order to meet those challenges. In the report, I drew attention to the fact that many sectors of farming, and the livestock sector in particular, are experiencing real financial hardship at this time, and there is now an urgent need to lower the burden, both in terms of time and cost, imposed on farmers by unnecessary and disproportionate regulation from the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I gave many examples of cases where regulation and penalties are disproportionate – even unfair in many cases. I talked of the need for impact assessments, of the need for more harmonisation of inspection standards, and I suggested that there is no reason why self-regulation could not be successfully used in agriculture. Above all, I call for a change in the common agricultural policy culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course I understand the need for financial integrity, but the Court of Auditors made it perfectly clear that over-complication has very often been the cause of the problem, and likewise I certainly understand that management and interpretation of regulations varies far too much from one nation to another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since writing the report, I have been heartened to notice that a number of national governments, as well as leading agricultural organisations, have called for simplification of the common agricultural policy. Surely, Commissioner, now that we are negotiating common agricultural policy reform, there has never been a better time to prove that we can help the industry and not hinder it with unnecessary red tape and unnecessary costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst I understand perfectly the advances you have made and I am grateful for that, I am dismayed that this is not being communicated at the farm gate back in the country where I come from.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in May, at the time of the vote in this House on the resolution on simplifying the common agricultural policy (CAP), we pointed out that this simplification must not result in either less aid for farmers or in the abolition of the means of organising the markets. I recall that the resolution that we adopted itself also gave this warning. Six months have passed since the resolution was adopted and serious reasons for concern remain, which the recent Commission communication has only served to exacerbate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The so-called traditional means of organising the markets, such as public intervention and others, neither should nor could be abolished on the pretext of alleged rationalisation and simplification, as to do so would continue and intensify the destruction of small and medium-sized agriculture that is under way in many countries. There is certainly much to do regarding the simplification of the CAP, much of which is positive and even necessary. I am referring, amongst many other possibilities, to the need to amend the penalties, not least when these relate to infringements which are not the farmer’s fault, to simplifying the application process, and to changes in animal identification. However, above and beyond simplification that would benefit all farmers, and small and medium-sized producers particularly, a profound shake-up of the CAP is also needed that reinforces intervention instruments, guaranteeing farmers fair prices; that restores the instruments regulating production, such as quotas and production rights; that – since we are talking about simplification – guarantees each country something as simple as the right to production, as well as the right to food security and sovereignty; and that establishes the principles of modelling and capping for aid, overcoming the current imbalances between producer countries and production levels.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, we are very concerned about the Commission’s insistence on subjecting agriculture and food production to the market and competitiveness. The result of this liberalisation policy has already been demonstrated: the unstoppable abandonment of production by millions of small and medium-sized farms, income insecurity and increased price volatility, and the exacerbation of food dependence in countless countries and regions. We agree with a simplification that serves farmers’ interests – in particular, those of small and medium-sized farmers – and enables them to carry on producing. We object to a simplification that kills off production and producers, and we will continue to fight it in this House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the thrust of the CAP reform report largely outlines measures illustrated under option 2. I imagine this is the Commission’s favoured approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have concerns about the lack of clarity and the timescale for approval. Will we be expected to decide the best option for the CAP before a refinement of proposals? I fear heavier bureaucratic burdens for farmers, despite the report calling for a simpler, more specific support scheme including simplification of cross-compliance rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report focuses on small and active farms, without defining how size and activity may be measured and monitored. The report states that the two pillars of the common agricultural policy should focus on efficiency, but I fear incentivising small farms while rewarding environmental development could see domestic farmers move away from production-focused farming in order to benefit from the CAP. I am concerned that, despite the report recognising long-term food security and growing global demand, our agricultural competitiveness will be squeezed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report talks about enhancing Europe’s latent productivity potential, while respecting EU commitments in international trade. It observes that the share of agriculture in the food supply chain decreased, while the share of the wholesale and distribution sectors increased. Bilateral agreements with Mercosur, including agriculture re-importation, could undermine the capacity for European farmers to trade at a fair market price.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report admits that European farmers face global competition, while having to respect environmental, food safety, quality and welfare objectives. Yet some South American farmers exploit deforestation and are able to mass-produce and then outprice European farmers due to less stringent regulation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the European Union is rather unpopular among Hungarian farmers, particularly smallholders. This is not only because 100% of our markets had to be sacrificed for the benefit of foreign food imports in exchange for a small fraction of the agricultural support granted to farmers in old Member States, but also because of the subject of today’s sitting, exaggerated bureaucracy and the awful administrative burdens that indeed, as it has been stated a number of times, prevent Hungarian farmers as well from actually doing their job – that of farming.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me to point out that in the old Member States, and therefore in Hungary, there is another major complication; namely, the state socialist or communist tradition, where some civil servants believe that it is not they who exist for the citizens and, in this case, for the farmers, but vice versa, that the citizens exist for the state and for the bureaucratic civil servants. Such civil servants make the lives of farmers more difficult absolutely unnecessarily, in a manner that humiliates and abuses, by regulating farmers beyond the rules already in place.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are continuously inundated with complaints. The last one, for example, was that payment of the costs of an event organised by tender under the second pillar was refused, stating that the farmer in question failed to obtain three quotations for the scones he served to participants. This is a typical case of humiliation, superfluous regulation and arbitrary use of power.</p>
      <p sl="hu">How can this be remedied? By ensuring that complaints against such abuses can be made not only to the decision maker, which we know to be an entirely futile attempt, but to the European Union itself, now that we have joined it and the European Union grants such aid from payments. The European Union should create a control mechanism for people to turn to, where humiliations and abuses of this type could be investigated and sanctioned.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would first of all like to welcome the commitment expressed by the Commission in the recent communication it presented to continue the process for simplifying the common agricultural policy. Excessive regulation means less competitiveness, while excessive inflexibility means less efficient operation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One of the reasons for the current request to reform the CAP is undoubtedly the need to simplify it. I would like to mention a few extremely important aspects of the resolution on CAP simplification adopted by this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="ro">My colleague, Michel Dantin, has mentioned those states which are going too far in their application of European legislation. I think that administrative formalities must be reduced to the bare essentials, not only at EU level, but at Member State level too.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission ought to consider the possibility of a common regulatory framework for the documentation requested. I would describe such a recommendation as the maximum tolerable level of bureaucracy. It is well known that where EU bureaucracy requests three signatures for approval, the national bureaucracies will, in turn, add another five signatures. Only those regulations and terms which are relevant and absolutely necessary, and which provide undeniable benefit, must continue to be applied.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Simplification itself is not sufficient. Measures providing training and information to potential beneficiaries must also be expanded. For instance, it ought to be compulsory for a fixed share of the rural development funds to be allocated to measures of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Given that simplification is directly linked to transparency, I will take advantage of the Commissioner’s presence in plenary to ask him a question out of context. In view of the recent decision made by the European Court of Justice concerning the beneficiaries of the European agricultural funds, what measures is the Commission considering in order to continue to ensure that information is published about these people?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too, like Mr Niculescu, welcome the Commission’s intention to keep up efforts towards simplifying the common agricultural policy, but I am also worried about the follow-up given to the report by Mr Ashworth on administrative simplification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, given the difficult economic climate in which our farmers currently find themselves, I would want the post-2013 CAP to enable farmers to concentrate on the main objective, which entails producing safe and quality foodstuffs, whilst at the same time encouraging them to provide non-commercial public services. It is high time to lighten the administrative burden carried by our producers, to root out unnecessary legislation, and to give the farmers of the 27 Member States the same chances of understanding what their obligations are but also what their rights are. What they need is a simpler and more responsive CAP.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when it is considered inevitable that farmers around the world are being pitted against each other, and this despite the successive farming and food crises, both in the North and in the South, at a time when farmers have to fight to get fair prices, a fairer remuneration for their work, the least we could do to help them is to ask the Commission to consult the stakeholders in the farming sector on a regular basis in order to assess the impact of our regulations on the ground and to define simple and transparent practical rules for our farmers and our taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To end with, I will quote Charles Baudelaire who said that absolute simplicity is the best way to distinguish oneself. So I invite the European Commission to devote itself to this vital mission and in that respect, I naturally fully trust that Mr Cioloş will reach that goal.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to ask you whether we can have any hope that this will happen. Can you tell us, Commissioner, that those principles will be central to the work we do on the CAP post-2013?</p>
      <p sl="en">I looked at your excellent document from last week. Some of the headlines tell us that agriculture is to guarantee food security and traceability. It is to provide European citizens with quality, value and diversity of food, to create local employment and deliver multiple economic, social, environmental and territorial benefits. It has to ensure effective public policy returns. It must be greener and contribute to climate change mitigation. It must address issues such as sustainable land management and biodiversity loss, promote renewable energies, foster animal and plant health and guarantee animal welfare. It must adhere to cross-compliance rules and abide by veterinary and phytosanitary regulations. It has to deal with volatility in the market and survive as the weakest link in the food chain. It has to compete with food imports from third countries produced under very different conditions. All of this, perhaps, on a decreasing budget.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, trimming back an overgrown and unnecessary bureaucracy is naturally in everyone’s interests, and particularly the entirely legitimate demand of farmers, who need as much time and energy as possible for their own work – crop production and rearing livestock – rather than for ploughing through red tape and filling in forms.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In 2005, the European Commission undertook to simplify the common agricultural policy. At the time, it set the ambitious target of a 25% reduction in the administrative burden by 2012. Although it cannot be denied that the Commission has made some effort, the actions to date have failed to bring either the expected simplification or an actual elimination of the inequalities between Member States. At the same time, it is absolutely essential to ensure a sufficiently flexible framework for the common agricultural policy, and especially for the system of direct payments. It is also necessary, within the framework of supporting diversity, to minimise the risk of providing support only to uncompetitive and inefficient production areas in the European Union. There is also a need to balance the aim of simplification with efforts to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>

Over the past few months, I have carried out a number of rural meetings across Northern Ireland. At each event, I asked farmers to identify the main areas of change that are needed within the sector. Of huge importance was the need to reduce red tape, which is seen as both adding unnecessary cost and taking up valuable time. The level of paperwork and the complexity of the detail needed is creating a huge burden on farmers and increasing fears of penalties.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this Parliament has been discussing reducing bureaucracy for years and years now. The Commission has formed an internal working group comprising senior officials who have been tasked with ensuring that regulation does not become too excessive. That is a rather strange set-up, a bit like having a butcher inspecting the quality of his own meat. On Parliament’s initiative, a working group which is external to the Commission, headed by the former Prime Minister of Bavaria, Mr Stoiber, was formed in response to that situation. After four years of the Stoiber committee’s existence, is the Commission able to say which approach is the best and most effective? The Commission’s internal working group or Mr Stoiber’s working group, which is external to the Commission?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, moving to regulation itself, which is carried out by Member States, and sometimes by five to eleven different supervisory authorities in Member States. That is far too many.

This proposal, in a certain sense, acts upon the recommendations presented by the European Parliament in the resolution of May this year. A reduction in the administrative and bureaucratic burden will make it easier for farmers to obtain funds, and it will improve the flow of information and increase the effectiveness of inspections conducted by local authorities. This, in turn, will ensure the supply of suitable amounts of safer food, and will also increase the competitiveness of our sector. We must, however, be sure that the process of simplification will really be carried out, both at European and at national level, that the proposed simplifications are not another somewhat worthless attempt at ignoring the truth and that these same simplifications lead to a reduction and not an increase in expenditure on administration.</p>

We must go much further and make the system much simpler, for small farms in particular, without losing sight of the fact that we need to achieve our objective of preventing fraud.

Freeing farmers from their most complex bureaucratic chores, for which they have little time, is a goal that we must achieve, so that they can devote themselves to farm work, wasting less time and incurring fewer costs.

If we go down the route of greening the first pillar of the common agricultural policy, we will unfortunately increase cross-compliance, we will be counting nature, we will be sending people out to farms and we will not achieve simplification. I described it as ‘green tape’. It is just as difficult as red tape but we are going to have both. I know that you appreciate the point and I think we need to be aware of it.</p>

Farmers see bankers getting away with blue murder in terms of no checks and balances, while they are caught for EUR 100. My last point is that there are multiple checks on farmers: retailers do it, processors do it, the European Union does it and competent authorities do it. There is a climate of fear.

And I understand the need for controls, but these should not destroy those who are conscientious, just because of the fraudsters.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am very happy to see that despite the time being quite late, there are so many people present to talk about simplifying the common agricultural policy. I think simplicity comes when we are clear with ourselves and when we know exactly what we want, and this is also reflected in the normative acts we draft.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, the proposals come from the Commission and they are adopted by the Council and by Parliament. Therefore, I am fully confident that when it comes to preparing the legislative package together, we will know just as well, in a clear and simple way, what we want and that we will avoid the specific exceptions and add-ons which mean that subsequently, the Commission will have to check them on the ground, since the same Commission is also accountable to you – Parliament – for how public money is spent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, I do not think that the CAP is preventing farmers from working, on the contrary. In many cases, the CAP is helping farmers to work. It is just that, whenever public money is involved, everyone needs to be able to account for how that public money was used. There is European legislation that results in standards for the farming sector, and I must say that the farming sector is maybe one of the only economic sectors for which legislation at European level is, in fact, checked on the ground. I do not know if this is the case for other sectors, but together we decided it would be that way. The standards that receive a lot of attention are only the application of European legislation on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is perceived as being complex is precisely this legislation on the environment and on animal wellbeing. There are also the procedures of specific measures, such as agri-environmental measures, for which there is special financial assistance, as well as investment measures that are often found in investment programmes like the rural development programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I totally agree that with regard to legislation such as it is applied in practice, more could be done to clarify what farmers need to do. Yet as far as the procedures for the specific measures are concerned, we also need to be clear: as long as we require specific measures that take into consideration regional particularities, we also need to exercise a specific control, otherwise we would have no credibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I totally agree, Mr Capoulas Santos, that we need to simplify as much as possible. However, I would not want to go so far as to reach a stage where we are no longer credible, no longer able to properly manage the money that is allocated to the CAP, and I would like this budget to be just as consistent in the future too. This consistency will also depend on our ability to justify and account for how the money is used.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards transparency, there is a decision by the Court of Justice. What I can tell you is that I am still in favour of this transparency. The regulation that is currently in force will be amended so that this judgment can be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will leave it at that, but I can assure you that I will continue to take decisions aimed at simplification, or at least ensure that the CAP does not become more complicated. As I have already said, we will have to do this work together and with Member States, since I talked to you about measures taken to cut red tape with reference to what the Commission is asking Member States. Now, CAP management is shared with Member States and what happens on the ground for the beneficiary, i.e. the farmer, depends on the way in which Member States and regions put this European legislation into practice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since good practice guides are useful, we are also going to work on these guides, but first of all, let us try and make the CAP simple and clear for the 27 Member States. Henceforth, with codecision, you, too, have the same responsibility as the Council in this area, and I am convinced that we will be able to work very well together.</p>

      <p sl="ga">A resolution adopted by Parliament earlier this year refers to the importance of reducing red tape for farmers. A major point made is that there should be simplification of the implementation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) as well as simplification of the CAP itself.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In relation to this, both the Commission and the Member States have an important role to play. A review of the CAP should focus on methods that would allow farmers to spend most of their time engaged in the most important thing: farming.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The Commission communication – published last week – referred to the importance of simplification and of reducing red tape. To improve the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, it must be ensured that the measures now in place be reformed and simplified in the CAP in its future form, and that no additional burden be placed on farmers.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I welcome what the Commissioner said last week about impact assessments being required before a new proposal is put forward. The principle of proportionality and the administrative burdens carried by farmers already must be taken into account in any new legislation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me pose a simple question. Why is there a common agricultural policy at all? Europe has an abundance of fertile agricultural land. We still have farmers willing and able to produce food. Europe and the World has an abundance of people who need to buy food. The mechanism of the market, if left to itself, would meet the needs of supply and demand at competitive prices. The CAP is an artificial, expensive and unnecessary burden on farmers and consumers. Let me suggest the easiest simplification of all: abolish the CAP!</p>

      <p sl="hu">The Commission’s communication, ‘The CAP towards 2020’, contains few concrete details as regards the practice of reducing administrative burdens. Even the word ‘simplification’ occurs only in a few places in the text, with reference to cross-compliance rules. The CAP system is too complex in other areas as well, and it is often opaque and incomprehensible to farmers. One of the most important tasks would be to put an end to ‘double regulation’. Several Member States impose stricter national requirements than those laid down in European Union legislation. This, in itself, distorts competition on the internal market. It would be useful if the various national authorities monitoring cross-compliance and their various sections would harmonise their efforts to ensure that farmers are not subjected in short succession to several different kinds of inspection. Given the current advances in telecommunications and IT, setting up a shared database would make this possible. The Commission’s proposed reform maintains support for environmental protection under the second pillar while, at the same time, a green allowance has been built into the criteria for direct payments under the first pillar. It is not yet known how these payments will be made. It would be good if this positive step did not entail new administrative burdens.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the situation in the beekeeping sector by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (O-0119/2010 – B7-0564/2010).</p>
    </intervention>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are about to vote on represents the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the European beekeeping support policy. As is normal practice for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this important paper has benefited from the participation of all the parliamentary groups, who have added their valuable contribution to the end result.</p>
      <p sl="it">Despite the recent increase in the annual budget for measures to improve the general conditions for production and marketing of bee products, a widespread concern persists with regard to the numerous challenges and problems that beekeeping will have to face in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="it">Difficult production and marketing conditions, strong and prolonged price volatility and difficulties emerging from the increasingly widespread mortality of bee stocks are some of the critical factors that afflict one of the most important sectors of European agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="it">Like all other primary sector operators, European beekeepers must be put in a position where they can plan their own affairs. Since the current support depends on European agricultural policy implementation procedures in force at present, the future of this policy after 2013 is uncertain. This is the background to today’s resolution, whereby we intend to call on the Commission to make an active commitment to defend beekeeping.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main demands to the Commission contained in the motion for a resolution include the following: a specific undertaking after the expiry of national programmes, also in view of new challenges and problems in the sector, namely bee mortality, price volatility etc.; a commitment to the necessary improvement in statistical measurements, for more effective control of non-EU honey imports and research development; a strengthening of the role of European veterinary policy; an action plan to tackle the phenomenon of widespread bee mortality, partly through specific undertakings in the field of research; greater financial support in the field of operator training and education and, lastly, a revitalised role as a leading player for the beekeeping sector within the common agricultural policy after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">In thanking Mrs Lulling and all my fellow MEPs for the common work carried out, I would like to remind you, Madam President, Commissioner, that the International Year of Biodiversity is about to end. This is why we hope that approval of the resolution will definitely mark the start of the road to relaunch a sector that is particularly strategic from the viewpoint of environmental sustainability and maintenance of biodiversity, as well as in terms of economic and social impact.</p>

    <intervention id="2-630" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, bees play an important role in pollination and in producing honey and related products. This sector is characterised by a great diversity of beekeeping conditions and by the dispersion and variety of stakeholders from production to the marketing stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some harmonised rules have been established at European Union level concerning honey marketing standards and the preservation of bee health.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The regulation on the single common market organisation provides for a series of measures aimed at improving conditions for producing and marketing apiculture products. These measures can be included in three-year apiculture programmes that are prepared by Member States and cofinanced by the European Union budget. The budget for these programmes has risen from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million for the 2011-2013 period.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These measures seem to be giving positive results in the beekeeping sector, both for Member States and for beekeepers. It is also important to note that all Member States have devised a programme, which shows their interest both in beekeeping and in the needs of this sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The sector is certainly facing a number of challenges. First, the fall in the number of beekeepers, making it crucial to encourage and train newcomers. Second, competition from third-country imports and issues related to the quality of the honey coming from these countries. Then there is the increase in bee mortality due to many different factors, including varroasis and other diseases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue of bee health is particularly worrying within but also outside the European Union. Beekeeping organisations are asking the European Union to concentrate more on bees in this regard. In November 2008, the European Parliament also adopted a resolution on the situation in the beekeeping sector which called on the Commission to put in place specific actions and to make sure these actions were coordinated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is obvious that bee health is an important matter and that it must be protected by the most suitable actions, while taking into account the sector’s particularities and the different players involved. In this context, the Commission has already launched a number of initiatives that seek to address the concerns of the beekeeping industry, and other actions are also planned for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission intends to present a communication soon that will seek to clarify the issues in connection with bee health and the key actions that the Commission intends to take in order to address them. This communication will serve as a basis for discussion with the European Parliament and the Council, as well as with authorities in the Member States and stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope this debate will help identify possible new actions that are necessary at European Union level on the question of preserving beekeeping and the production of honey and related products, but also to help preserve bee health and prevent any problems that could arise because of disease or pollution.</p>

    <intervention id="2-631" speaker_id="1186" name="Astrid Lulling" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, when I took over responsibility for the situation in the beekeeping sector in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development from my German fellow Member, Reimer Böge, 16 years ago, another German MEP said to me rather disparagingly: ‘Oh, I see, the little creatures for the little countries’. Since then, I have tried hard to make it clear within the constantly growing EU how important these little creatures are, not only for our quality of life, but also for our survival.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the meantime, we have made continuous progress in raising awareness at all levels within the EU of the need for a comprehensive common policy to ensure that there are enough bees in the EU and enough beekeepers of all ages to look after them. This has become all the more important as a result of the high levels of bee mortality in many regions, which have given rise to justified concerns about whether there are enough bees and beekeepers to meet our needs. This is why I have launched this initiative in the form of an oral question to the Commission with a debate and a resolution. I am very grateful for the fact that this resolution has been supported by all the groups in the House. The objective warrants the joint action by all the political groups on behalf of our resolution. It is brief, clearly structured and easy to understand, which is not always the case in this House. We make it clear where the problems lie. The specific solutions that we are proposing have been worked out in very close cooperation with the beekeeping sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">Beekeepers from many Member States have come to Strasbourg today with their products, but also with their concerns and expectations, to highlight the fact that they need our help in solving their problems. When you consider that, from a budget of more than EUR 140 billion, only EUR 32 million has been spent on safeguarding three quarters of the food production and four fifths of the plants which are dependent on pollination, it should be clear to everyone here that the important task today is to ensure the continuation and the development of this policy beyond 2013. That is our message. I believe that it will be heard, not only in Parliament, but also in the Commission, in the Council and in the Member States. In any event, we will make sure that this happens. I am making an urgent call to all the Members of this House to be present for the vote and to vote in favour of this resolution. We owe this to the bees. It is true that they are hibernating while we are having this discussion. Incidentally, I believe that the discussion …</p>
      <a text="(The President cut off the speaker)"/>
      <p sl="de">I just wanted to say that the Conference of Presidents, which thinks it is a good idea to put this discussion at the end of a night sitting, needs to do its homework in order to understand the importance of bees in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, unfortunately, the problems affecting European beekeeping are more serious and deeper rooted than the cyclical crises that recurrently affect other, apparently more important, sectors. The problem with beekeeping is, above all, environmental and has consequences that could become catastrophic if we are unable to respond adequately in time.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Two statistics from the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations – cited in the motion for a resolution and already mentioned by Mrs Lulling – are illuminating: 84% of plant species and 76% of food production depend on pollination. However, agriculture is also an important economic activity in rural areas, with great potential for growth, since European production is a long way from guaranteeing our needs. No other ‘livestock activity’ – and livestock is in inverted commas here, obviously – is so closely linked to nature and sustainability or plays such an important and irreplaceable ecological role as beekeeping. These are more than enough reasons for us not to stint on our efforts and funding for investigating the principle causes of the bees’ frightening and increasing death rate, and for supporting health programmes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This debate should also provide an opportunity to find imaginative and effective ways of including aid for this particular type of landless livestock in the aid mechanisms of the new common agricultural policy (CAP), at the very moment when the use of units of area as the basic criterion for allocating new aid is being planned. I should therefore like the Commission to clarify what its immediate responses to this problem will be, and whether it is thinking of including this activity in the new CAP architecture that we are about to start debating.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, providing protection for bees is in the best interests of the agricultural sector and many farmers are also beekeepers. We have seen a decline in the bee population in many regions of Europe. We must identify the causes of this problem and take the necessary countermeasures. It is a good thing that the budget funding for the national bee programmes up to 2013 has been increased from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million. However, that is not enough. We must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013. In order to achieve this, it is also particularly important for us to improve and simplify the process which allows researchers, beekeepers and farmers to share specialist knowledge. We should focus as soon as possible on combating the diseases and parasites to which bees are subject. We must not leave the beekeepers to fight this battle on their own.</p>
      <p sl="de">We urgently need better and more standardised statistics from all the Member States throughout the EU. This is because we need to work with facts and not just with speculation. As the number of beekeepers is constantly falling, we also need to invest more in education and training. We should provide more support for young beekeepers and also for full-time beekeepers, to ensure that the profession has a future and does not die out. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will be brief, although I do think Mrs Lulling’s idea of cross-pollinating speaking time across the groups is certainly one to be further considered.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will echo comments about the beekeeping sector, but I would remind colleagues that the wild bumble bee population across Europe is also in a similar – and very grave – situation. They are just as important for biodiversity and the pollination benefits that we have heard of – very correctly – about the honey bee sector. I would pay tribute to the work of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust in Scotland, covering the bumble bee population across the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I would pick up on question 4 – an excellent question – suggesting that the Commission bring bee diseases into the veterinary policy. This has been a long-standing call of this Parliament, and it strikes me that this is not just about doling out money but about sharing best practice and knowledge across the Union. A lot of scientists in a lot of places are working on this, and the Commission could play a very powerful role in pooling that information and working out how much we know about this connected and very serious problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we are all aware of the importance of bees in pollination. They are absolutely crucial to agriculture and food production. Indeed, without them, there is no food production.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore very worrying that the beekeeping sector continues to report that the mortality rates are astonishingly high. Although I feel that we have been successful in raising the awareness and communicating the severity of the situation over the years, we must maintain pressure to ensure that research into the cause of these mortality rates continues and remains well funded. Only then can concrete steps be taken to address the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I wish to see that funding for research projects is maintained after 2012, and I would support the initiatives which encourage young beekeepers into the apiculture sector. We are, of course, entering a period of intense debate on the future of the CAP, and I believe that this is a fundamental problem that should continue to be addressed in the context of a revised EU agricultural policy after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">In essence, support for the agriculture sector should be strengthened after 2013. I think we have an opportunity to do something positive. Let us support the bees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the problem with this report on the diminishing bee population is that there is a real tragedy here. However, having examined this document, I find that the proposals being put to this House are a classic example of what is known in this building as a ‘beneficial crisis’. Beneficial, that is, for the EU, with proposals constructed on the basis of extending EU control over a wider and wider area. No change there then.</p>
      <p sl="en">The CAP features in passing in this report, but there is no mention of the destructive effect of the imposition of that policy in my country. I am thinking here of the nature of hedgerows and the working of fields and orchards, the management of which has been seriously interfered with by EU legislation, to the detriment of bees in Britain.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report admits that it cannot identify the prime cause for the drop in bee numbers, and so cites a large number of possibilities. It lists bee disease, bees’ weakened immunity to pathogens and parasites, climate change – you could bet that one would be in here – and the disappearance of mellifluous flora. The possible deleterious effect of genetically modified plants is grudgingly admitted, but dismissed as insignificant – you could have bet on that being here, too.</p>
      <p sl="en">In truth, these are all guesses. The one constant in all this is the presence of the Varroa mite which attacks the bees’ immune system and is probably the root cause of this whole problem. But no, the plight of bees is used as an excuse to introduce a whole host of regulations calling, amongst other things, for cooperation between beekeepers’ associations from Member States, tighter controls on the importation of honey, increased labelling requirements – hardly designed to stop the bees dying, surely – product authorisation, whatever that is, and a move to recruit young beekeepers. Amazing. Whilst all this is taking place, the Varroa mite continues its pernicious work and bees die.</p>
      <p sl="en">No doubt well intentioned, this report needs to be reduced to identifying and eliminating whatever it is that is killing our bees, and to allow the international community to deal with it, not to serve as an excuse for more and more and more EU regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this has been an important, and indeed passionate, discussion on this particular subject. I am glad to see it and to be able to take part in it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the importance of bees within agriculture, in broad terms, is generally undervalued, even within the sector itself. Without bees, many crops would fail. Of course, orchards are particularly reliant on bees for pollination. I recently visited a number of orchard owners in Northern Ireland who have suffered from the declining bee population and indeed voiced their concern over it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree that bee diseases should be highlighted in EU veterinary policy, both to highlight the importance of bees and also to have a policy and to monitor the population across Europe. Money must be invested in research and development into the diminishing bee population and funding must be made available to schemes which can help. I believe that a balanced view of the decline of the bee population must be taken into consideration, not just blaming farming practices but investing in investigation into diseases and ways of minimising their impact.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Mrs Lulling asked us to support the motion for a resolution. We can do so wholeheartedly as a truly excellent document is in the making.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The most important statement of this document is the one which calls on the European Commission to ensure that the current support programmes in the apiculture sector today are continued and strengthened after 2013. There is an immense need for this support, as the market does not recognise apicultural products in a manner that ensures the survival of the apiculture sector, even though apiculturists provide a great many services to agriculture and the preservation of biodiversity through pollination.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Another very important statement within this document is the call on the European Commission to change labelling rules for honey products within the framework of quality policy. This is because the current rules allow the possibility for abuse, namely, to mark as honey of European origin honey which contains only a very minimal amount of European honey, and, in fact, contains mostly honey imported from a third country, which may even be of poorer quality.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Yet another very important statement within this document is the call on the European Commission to table a legislative proposal which excludes the possibility of labelling products with a less than 50% honey-based sugar content as products made from honey.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I have been fighting for these issues for years here in the European Parliament. I have not managed to have them included in any document as perfectly as they are now stated in this motion for a resolution.

    <intervention id="2-639" speaker_id="29579" name="Marc Tarabella" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reason I decided to table several amendments to Mr Paolo De Castro’s excellent proposal is because beekeeping is an essential economic sector. I am sure our excellent fellow Member, Mrs Lulling, will agree, since she has been working on this problem since 1994. I think we can pay tribute to her this evening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to realise that the disappearance of bees would amount to an unprecedented upheaval in the history of mankind. Such a change in biodiversity would put vital food diversity at risk. This profound disturbance of ecosystems would destroy all prospects for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The disappearance of pollinating bees is to be taken seriously, for the collapse in numbers of both the wild bee and the honey bee can now be measured on a global scale. Cocoa, vanilla, melon, passion fruit, all these tropical crops are entirely dependent on pollinating bees for their production of fruit and seeds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On all continents and increasingly often, honey bees are dying in large numbers at the end of the winter. In Europe, many beekeepers have had to shut up shop. Currently, over 80% of species of flowering plants in the world and 80% of species grown in Europe rely directly on pollination by insects, bees for the most part. Without foraging bees, most crops would not produce a satisfactory yield. This is the case for many wild species, but also for fruit trees, protein crops and vegetable crops. So it would be difficult to think of a meal in which bees did not play an important role.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The causes of their decline are known: destruction of their nesting sites, increasing scarcity of the plants that provide them with nectar and pollen, but also diseases, parasites, and especially the use of pesticides, more specifically neurotoxic pesticides, which are particularly harmful for bees. Farmers and gardeners must recognise that bees are totally defenceless when faced with toxic products and that they are precious contributors to their crops and need to be protected as a matter of priority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will close by saying that we must react, for we cannot accept honey coming from elsewhere – the quality is lower and it does not meet our strict production criteria – as being inevitable, as the only alternative to the dearth of honey that is slowly taking hold in Europe. I therefore call on Mr Cioloş and the Commission to include beekeeping in the CAP with specific measures.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner: thank you for your comments. You yourself outlined the challenges that we face: a reduction in the numbers of beekeepers and the need to attract new and professional apiarists, and – crucially – the increase in bee mortality caused by a number of factors but, in particular, by the presence of the Varroa mite, which compromises the immune system of bees.</p>
      <p sl="en">All of us agree that bee health is important, and I am pleased to hear that the Commission will put forward key measures to deal with the current, very serious situation. I would emphasise the need to ensure consultation of beekeepers when drawing up any programmes, in order to ensure, first of all, their effectiveness, and secondly, their implementation. As well as beekeepers, we need to ensure sustainable, pollinator-friendly farming practices. I think this is very important and should be an element in the CAP.</p>

So I would see value in an information campaign, because we need the support of citizens in this matter to justify the money we spend on a bee protection programme.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the EU Alarm programme identified unviable practices in land use and the use of agrochemicals as the main causes of the worrying loss of pollinating insects in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I received a very disappointing answer to a written question which I submitted in January from the Commissioner at the time, Mr Boel. We know that 84% of European crops depend, to a degree, on pollinating insects for fertilisation and that, in order to protect them, we need to create compulsory ecological recovery zones and further strengthen agro-environmental measures by restructuring the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commissioner stated that she is satisfied. However, the measures have failed to address the problem of the loss of bees. Given that agro-environmental measures only account for 8% of the total CAP budget up to 2013, and each Member State applies them differently, we insist that agro-environmental measures need greater support and uniform application and checks as to whether they are right. We also need greater emphasis on organic and ecological methods. These measures and small-scale production need to be supported and the creation of beekeeping cooperatives and ecological recovery zones needs to be encouraged.</p>

In the UK alone, we have many prominent UK organisations with campaigns – from the Women’s Institute to the Cooperative Society. The information campaign is there. It just needs to be picked up on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Please take a look at the Women’s Institute campaign, which I have sent you details of. It is full of practical information for anybody who wants to help bees thrive. The Women’s Institute represents millions of ordinary people in the UK. The plight of the bee offers a possibly unique opportunity to work with citizens. It covers the common agricultural policy, biodiversity, food security, pesticide use, veterinary regulations, and even the labyrinthine way of funding through the EU. It is a very unique opportunity to engage with organisations that are already inspired to work. I would ask the Commissioner to take that opportunity and run with it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in view of the exceptional significance of the beekeeping sector for agricultural production, the need to preserve biodiversity and the nutritional values of honey, existing support for the beekeeping sector should be maintained and increased after 2013. Such measures contribute to an improvement in the health of bees, an increase in the numbers of swarms and a growth in the production of honey. As in other sectors, the effectiveness of beekeeping depends, in large measure, on the knowledge, qualifications and experience of beekeepers. In Poland, we have the only vocational secondary school of beekeeping in Europe, and it has students from several countries. This school and its facilities, together with the nearby University of Life Sciences in Lublin and also the agricultural research institutes in Puławy, could be used as the basis for the establishment of a European School of Beekeeping. Beekeepers’ organisations are of great significance in terms of development of the sector. Many efforts concerning programmes for the support of training and for tackling problems involving quality and standards should be carried out in conjunction with them.</p>

      <p sl="el">Our development interventions and changes in land use, the crops we choose to farm and the farming methods we apply, even the way in which we create demand and habits in our daily life, have helped to tip the balance in nature. Sometimes, this results in the unexplained mortality of bees and the emergence of new diseases and sometimes, in an increase in production costs.</p>
      <p sl="el">We therefore need to adopt medium-term and short-term measures to address all the symptoms of the problem, together with a more permanent solution to the root cause of this problem. Therefore, the new common agricultural policy needs to take an integrated approach to beekeeping, by strengthening support programmes and veterinary cover for the sector, by highlighting its good points, by defending biodiversity and by mitigating the problem of climate change and the deterioration in natural resources.</p>

Honey bees are of great economic significance and ecological importance – we all appreciate that.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, for many years, a growing death rate has been observed among bees. This has an adverse effect on the production of fruit, vegetables and other crops which are pollinated by bees, and is a threat to biodiversity in general. The role of bees in plant pollination is indispensable. For thousands of years, beekeeping has been an important part of Europe’s cultural heritage. In my country, where we have specialist fruit production, farmers noticed a very long time ago the beneficial effect of the work of bees on the size and quality of harvests.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, bees are being attacked, today, by a variety of diseases and pests, and the beekeepers themselves are not coping with this. This is why financial support is necessary for research into the causes of bee diseases and the factors which are bringing about a reduction in the resistance of bees and the death of swarms. New and more effective programmes are needed to prevent and eliminate diseases of bee colonies.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with some 600 000 beekeepers and just under 14 million hives throughout the EU, beekeeping represents an area of considerable importance within the Union farming sector. This importance is emphasised by the bee’s role as a defender of biodiversity as well as a producer of honey. This is a complete food, full of nutrients, and acknowledged to be of the highest quality.</p>
      <p sl="it">By virtue of this role, it is planned to increase annual aid to the sector in Europe from EUR 26 million for 2008-2010 to EUR 32 million for 2011-2013. The European Parliament intends to guarantee these funds even after 2013 because beekeeping is one of the activities fully compatible with the sustainability and diversification objectives that the new CAP aims to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="it">The very aim of this funding is to support beekeeping, partly through national research projects into new methods to combat the high mortality rate of bees, which has reached alarming levels in recent years. On the other hand, however, it is important to ensure fair transparency in aid distribution and guarantee more resources to states that actually need them.</p>
      <p sl="it">When the paper was examined by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee voted on an amendment proposed by myself, calling for aid to be distributed on the basis of the results of a survey of hives present in the various Member States and not on the basis of estimated data. I believe this is extremely important for the purposes of guaranteeing transparency for public expenditure and protection for those who actually practise beekeeping activities.</p>
      <p sl="it">A system is already active in many countries for surveying hive numbers, but we are aware of the difficulty of implementing this in other states and we propose that a programme for beekeeping that is transparent and bound to have a certain impact on the profits of many beekeepers can be introduced throughout the European Union.</p>

A few days ago, a scientist came to see me and explained that the numerous planes that we can see in the sky have an effect on the diffraction of sun rays, leading to exhaustion and therefore to the excessive mortality of bees, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Contrary to what one of our fellow Members on the right of this Chamber just said, I believe that here we have an example of a sector where pooling our knowledge and coordinating research programmes can provide a solution to the problems faced by each of our countries.

      <p sl="en">I think it is acceptable to raise the opinion on GM, but there are no GM crops grown in Ireland – and I think the same is true of the UK – yet we have problems with bee populations, so I think we need to be very careful about comments we make in relation to the causes of the problem. We have a problem and we do not know the reason for it. I support the call for research but with some caution. We throw money at research but let us look for better quality research – and coordinated research across Member States – to get the results that beekeepers want and absolutely need.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to look at the statistics, because I gather that if Member States count bees at all, they count them in very different ways. We need to look at what we are comparing across the European Union.</p>

It does work, but if you are going to ask farmers who farm for a living to do this, you need to support it.

      <p sl="ro">Romania, the Member State which I come from, is among the main beneficiaries of these funds, to the tune of approximately EUR 3.4 million. The Commission’s decision is therefore of paramount importance to Romanian beekeepers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also welcome the initiative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to launch this debate about such an important topic. I fully support the suggestions included in the proposal for a resolution which we are going to vote on, on Thursday.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Beekeeping provides jobs for a large number of families in Europe, especially in areas where the conditions are not conducive to other activities. Beekeeping also promotes economic development in rural areas. On this point, I would like to stress that it is important for European support programmes to focus not only on honey producers, but also on small processors, especially as part of the current second pillar of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The honey processing and packing lines offer competitive advantages in terms of market access, quality and attractiveness of the products to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, apiculture products are used not only for food consumption, but also become ingredients in products. This is why we must encourage solutions which will help achieve products with high added value at local level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I regret that support for small processors does not feature in the proposal for a resolution because encouraging these people basically means encouraging those directly involved in keeping bees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think firstly it is appropriate that in our group, Ms Lulling, is the expert on bees, because she herself has many of the qualities of the bee. She buzzes around Parliament like a bee. She is as sweet as honey most of the time, and she can sting like a bee when people stand on her corns. So you could say that she is the queen bee of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a more serious note, Einstein said that if the bee population died out, man himself would die out within four years. Perhaps an exaggeration, yet Einstein was a genius and he knew what he was talking about – because no more bees, no more pollination and no more fruit, no more plants, no more man and, God forbid, no more Lullings. So we have a serious problem, because the population globally has declined rapidly over the last 10 years. There are a number of issues which have been raised.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first problem is that of the parasites – the Varroa mite – that has to be addressed and dealt with. Insecticides have a knock-on effect on bees as a result of being sprayed on plants. Then we have the harsh winters: in 2008, three million bees died during that harsh winter. Then, of course, we have what we have in other areas, such as beef and fish: too many imports coming in too easily from third countries and undermining our own production. These things need to be addressed with research and also with targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think young people, because they are now very pro-nature, could be encouraged to go into beekeeping – as Ms McGuinness said, maybe as a hobby first, and some could go into it on a full-time basis if it proved productive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I think we should include in the CAP a 2020 target for bees: that is, to increase the population by 20% so that our bees can be as durable as Madam Lulling.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as Mr Kelly has said, we have the queen bee here, who has had lots of suitors, as the queen bee plays a crucial role in relation to all the activities that go on in the hive.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we think of the common agricultural policy, we think of mega-scale farming. We think about cattle, beef, dairying, sheep, vegetables, wine and so on. Here we have a Cinderella area that is absolutely au naturel if it is properly managed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look at the background to this, and it is quite clear that, as has been said, bees have a wonderfully diverse role as pollinators and suppliers. The increase in bee-related diseases is endangering the species, which would be a tragedy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States have their own various initiatives, but there is very little or no coordination. What we need to do is to guarantee financial support for this particular sector. Beekeeping is dependent on the modalities of the common agricultural policy, so we need to have a special line in relation to beekeeping.</p>
      <p sl="en">Quite apart from the economic reality, if you look at, for example, the situation in relation to the health properties of honey – as we have more and more honey-based health supplements – it is quite obvious that the benefits from the point of view of the health of the ordinary human being are huge for those who decide to consume honey on a daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are doing here today is launching what Mrs Lulling did back in 1997, and that is putting a specific emphasis onto something that is out there, that is natural and that we can do on a daily basis. But we have got to ensure that it is protected, because there is too much contamination and a lack of regulation and documentation in terms of the actual statistics.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last, but by no means least, we have a capacity to determine the number of hives that are out there. It is not the number of hives, it is the number of bees and the number of swarms that is important at the end of the day: the actual numbers of bees which are actively promoting the whole honey product which we depend on as a human race and which is so hugely beneficial to all – each and every one of us. So I commend my colleague, Mrs Lulling, for a wonderful initiative and I wish it well.</p>

The constant decline in the bee population over a number of years sends out a clear alarm signal. The high levels of bee mortality caused by the Varroa mite and the unresolved problem of colony collapse disorder will unfortunately not go away. Therefore, we must make sure that the beekeeping sector receives support beyond 2013. Two points are particularly important to me in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, without wide-ranging scientific research, it will not be possible to provide an effective explanation of bee mortality or to do anything useful to combat it. My second point is about the product of beekeeping, the honey. The same quality standards must apply to imported honey as to the honey produced in Europe. Anything else would be seen as an attempt to deceive consumers and to put European producers at a competitive disadvantage.</p>

The beekeepers’ production of honey, beeswax, propolis and pollen is only the smaller part of their activity, is it not. The larger part is that they multiply the qualitative and quantitative value of other agricultural produce as well through pollination. This is a form of common good that ought to be recompensed in some way. We suggested the introduction of the concept of community beekeeping, and even if we have not managed to achieve this now, we strongly recommend that at Member State level, beekeepers are given financial reward for their activity in the interest of the common good.</p>

This situation is problematic for agriculture and, as fellow Members have been saying, for biodiversity, because of the enormous implications for food production and plant species that depend on pollination. The life of a worker bee is very short – around six weeks – and very sensitive to environmental changes. This means that honey production has also been affected, not just because of the increasingly uncertain length and stability of the seasons, but also because of growing threats from outside sources, such as pesticide use and mites, amongst other things. Increased research into these could help produce better applied solutions, as well as more suitably enhanced measures to aid biodiversity and reduce the effects of climate instability.

On that, we can also say that nature is sometimes much more severe with our mistakes then we are, when we do not respect certain rules.</p>

We will just have to consider how we can ensure we get added value from using the European budget for this type of programme, whilst ensuring that Member States have the flexibility to use it well.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I have been in touch with beekeeping organisations in Latvia. On the whole, they welcome the fact that the problems besetting this sector are now under discussion, but they have questions concerning some points of the resolution which have not been adequately explained. Unfortunately, our work and the text of the resolution have come under criticism in the Latvian media. Having read the text of the resolution, several beekeepers’ representatives were under the impression that honey consisting of 50% real honey only, the rest being made up of various sweeteners, could be labelled ‘honey’. Naturally, representatives of Latvia’s beekeeping sector, who produce honey of very high quality, consider this proposition absurd. I therefore consider that the resolution must make it clearer that this concerns processed honey products, so that there can be no misunderstanding on this question and so that our work does not cause the public to take a negative view of the work of Members of the European Parliament. In the same vein, I should like to stress that we must discuss again and again the fact that people active not only in the beekeeping sector but in agriculture as a whole are noticeably ageing. Only 7% of Europe’s farmers are younger than 35 and no fewer than 4.5 million farmers will be retiring in the next 10 years. We must develop support mechanisms for young farmers working in beekeeping and in other sectors of agriculture. Generational change in agriculture is a strategic issue that is important for the future of the European Union and affects all European Union citizens.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Beekeeping is one of the key activities supporting agricultural production. Its explicit features demand a specific approach to those who are involved in it. In recent times, we have seen, on the one hand, a massive onset of some serious diseases among bees (varroasis) and, on the other, an ageing population of beekeepers in many states, with a number of national governments undervaluing support for their work in a time of economic crisis. There are also other factors which threaten the continuing existence of beekeeping and thereby, indirectly, also the yields of many important agricultural crops. These include, among other things, the use of chemicals in agriculture and forestry management. In this situation, it is high time to adopt strong measures in support of beekeeping and in support of research aimed at treatments for bee diseases, and to provide training for those interested in taking up beekeeping. Whether we are talking about a transitional period up to 2013 or a new seven-year period, it is vital to draw up sufficiently motivating programmes for developing beekeeping, supported by the relevant instruments, including both legal instruments at the EU level, as well as the allocation of financial resources and establishment of control mechanisms helping to monitor fulfilment of the objectives of the beekeeping support and development programme. Without the appropriate measures, there will be a threat both to fruit growing and to the developing cultivation of many field crops.

This is crucial in order to prevent the negative impact that is very likely to be had on our food production, since we know that 84% of plant species depend on pollination by bees. Therefore, as a first step in combating bee population collapses, we must gain a better insight into this phenomenon by carrying out more research into bee mortality. Secondly, and in addition, we urge the Commission to increase its support for the beekeeping sector and to renew the existing support programmes before they come to an end, as planned, in 2012.</p>
