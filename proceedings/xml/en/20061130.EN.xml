      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years considerable progress has been made, broadly speaking, in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including better access to effective treatment and to prevention programmes. Nevertheless, the number of people infected with HIV or dying of AIDS continues to grow. By the end of 2006, almost 40 million people will have been infected with HIV, 2.6 million more than at the end of 2004. It is estimated that in 2006 4.3 million people, both adults and children, have been newly infected with HIV, which is 400 000 more than two years ago.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Sub-Saharan Africa remains at the forefront of this epidemic. More than 63% of all adults infected with HIV now live in Sub-Saharan African countries, and 33% in South Africa. The biggest increase in the past two years has been observed in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the number of people infected with HIV has risen by 21%. The continuing growth in the number of newly diagnosed infections in most EU Member States, together with the results of Eurobarometer surveys from 2005, indicate that levels of awareness on epidemics in the EU and in neighbouring countries must be raised as a matter of urgency and that prevention programmes in this field must be strengthened. The strategy set up by the Commission in 2005 was centred around the priority of strengthening prevention, treatment and care in certain regions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Despite these disturbing figures, there has been a reduction in the incidence of AIDS in some African and Caribbean countries and in some regions of southern Asia. It is possible to reverse the trend. There are more women around the world infected with HIV than ever before. In 2006, the number of infected women has reached 17.7 million, a million cases more than in the last two years. The situation in Sub-Saharan African countries is worse still. Women account for 60% of adults of 15 years and above infected with HIV. In addition to biological factors, and the fact that women and girls are much more susceptible to becoming infected with HIV, social and economic factors arising from gender inequality and the neglect of their rights also play a part. Equal rights for women is a key social challenge and an essential prerequisite for even-handed development and increased HIV prevention. In order that girls and women around the world can gain access to sexual and reproductive health, health services in developing countries must be strengthened so as to establish voluntary counselling, medical examinations, healthcare and support, as part of an all-round package.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Access to medicines and healthcare has improved considerably in recent years, although in most countries it was starting from a very low base. Thanks to the increased provision of antiretroviral treatment, some 2 million lives have been saved in almost four years and even in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, some 8 000 people have received treatment. Nevertheless, despite this welcome progress, the situation gives cause for concern, and the international community needs to devote more attention to it.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission is setting up intensive assistance, for partner countries in Africa and elsewhere, geared towards combating epidemics by means of integrating prevention, treatment and care. HIV/AIDS cannot be viewed as an isolated problem because it highlights all of the major problems facing developing countries, namely restricted access to basic social services, gender inequality, unequal distribution of resources, ineffective public administration and low levels of economic and technological development. HIV/AIDS is closely linked with malaria and tuberculosis, which are also poverty-related infectious diseases. HIV/AIDS can only be combated successfully if the partner countries fight against it in the context of efforts to reduce poverty.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The main principle underpinning the European political framework adopted in 2004, and the European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis adopted the following year, is an integrated approach to HIV. The European Programme for Action must be implemented and coordinated by the Commission, both at State and at worldwide level. It is indeed the partner countries that are in the best position to decide the most effective way of distributing resources effectively, fairly and transparently among the various initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Over the course of the years, the Commission has continually increased its resources in the fight against HIV/AIDS in all developing countries, especially in Africa, where it is providing assistance to partner countries via budgetary support in their efforts to address the structural factors underlying the HIV epidemic, such as healthcare reforms and the crisis in the area of human resources in the heath sector. Among other initiatives, the Commission has also invested a considerable amount of money, EUR 522 million over five years, in the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries from the global fund for the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. During 2006, the Commission’s role in the global fund was fully confirmed by the fact that the board elected a Member of the European Commission to the post of Vice-President of the fund.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission has traditionally taken the lead in efforts to improve access to antiretroviral drugs in developing countries and to ensuring the full availability of treatment and access to prevention for those who need them by 2010, and has played a central role in reducing the cost of pharmaceutical products. In some cases, there has been a reduction of up to 98%, which has been achieved by means of introducing a price varying mechanism that enables developing countries to pay less for patented medicines while protecting manufacturers from the re-import of these products into open markets where profits can be made.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Also in the framework of the WTO, the Commission is helping the poorest countries, whose production capacity is limited, to exercise their rights to import cheap generic medicines produced with compulsory licences. The Commission has also increased investment in the research and development of vaccines and other means of prevention, such as microbicides, with a view to broadening the existing range of HIV prevention mechanisms. The Commission will continue with these efforts to make prevention and treatment fully available to all those who need it by 2010.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As previous speakers have mentioned, the Commission has, in conjunction with the Member States, undertaken to fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic by means of a range of measures aimed at prevention, treatment, support and care. We are fully aware that the ultimate goal of a generation without AIDS is unattainable without firm political commitment, informed leadership and increased resources at global, national and local levels.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We face a huge challenge: making further progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and ensuring that prevention and treatment will be fully available to all those who need them by 2010. We urgently need a more balanced strategy aimed at increasing prevention and treatment and ensuring access to affordable treatment, in particular as regards patented second-tier medicines. We must therefore mobilise the political will for this in Europe. We must work more closely with the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on developing new methods of prevention, in particular microbicides, which will provide better prevention for women and will ensure that new medicines are more affordable. The pharmaceutical industry must be encouraged to carry out research and to develop vaccines and other products to combat HIV/AIDS. Lastly, we must make sure that the partner countries receive long-term reliable funding to support them in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In this connection, the Commission will continue to work, on a broader scale, with the help of the financial instruments at both national and global levels, including the global fund for the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We need strong support and cooperation from all of the EU institutions, however, including Parliament, as they are responsible for the annual allocation of financial resources. In the fight against HIV/AIDS, we have the opportunity to achieve better results, but this requires political will. The Commission firmly believes that the ultimate aims, namely a generation without AIDS and making treatment and care available to all those who need it, are attainable. I look forward to working with Parliament to achieve those aims.</p>

      <p sl="de">As we again approach World AIDS Day, we commemorate, we remember friends and we resolve to do more. We are now commemorating 25 years of AIDS. We remember the 25 million fellow citizens who have died from AIDS and we think of the 40 million living with AIDS. Many of them live in Europe and many in neighbouring countries to the east, such as Russia, Kaliningrad and Central Asia, but two-thirds live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the north have promised our support. We have earmarked money for this and then, all too often, lost it again. Science advances, but we have not yet delivered. Only 5% of HIV-positive children receive medical help. Fewer than 10% of the 15 million AIDS orphans receive financial support. Every year we have a resolution. A resolution is two things: a form of words and good intentions, or a determination to achieve those ends.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to invest in research and trials for the development of AIDS vaccines. We need to invest in service delivery and education for drugs and therapies, in mothers and children, in preventative campaigns, in health and care professionals and in NGO support teams. We need to pull out all the stops to meet the UN target of universal access to services, to treatment and to care by 2010, as the Commissioner said. The year 2010 is not far away, but we are.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="2123" name="Glenys Kinnock" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, our funding for HIV/AIDS prevention is still running well below target, falling behind by something like USD 12 billion. Therefore, as the Commissioner said, there is an urgent need for more public and private funding in order to address the shortcomings.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no single panacea for HIV eradication, but there has to be more education and more funding for vaccine research and for microbicides, which the Commissioner mentioned. The development of a vaginal microbicide has to be our immediate priority, and it is predicted that it could be developed and used within five years. It is the only way for women to have real control over their own sexual health. It is a method that does not require the consent of a partner.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, AIDS treatments in the developing world will not, and cannot, be sustainable unless there is a supply of the newer versions of generic medicines, which are increasingly needed as drugs-resistant cases of HIV/AIDS become more frequent. That means we have to be much more audacious in the way we confront the patents that pharmaceutical companies continue to hide behind, making the price of treatment impossible to meet in many developing countries and under the kind of health systems my colleague, Mr Bowis, mentioned.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Mr Špidla, I am pleased that the Commission has devoted the first section of this communication to the need to involve civil society in all aspects of combating this epidemic. This complies with the requirement put forward in the Dublin and Vilnius declarations. Information and the appropriate services which are provided by easily accessed support centres managed by non-governmental organisations to risk groups in society affected by HIV can significantly slow down the spread of AIDS in a country. As rapporteur, I am troubled by the fact that in several new Member States the continued existence of such a support centre is currently directly under threat as a result of a lack of financial resources. It turns out that, prior to accession to the European Union, these centres received multilateral financial support from various existing funds and organisations, including some outside Europe, which now, following the countries’ accession to the European Union, consider their charitable missions to be at an end. Despite the undertaking of the Minister of Health, expressed in the Vilnius declaration, to use national financial instruments as well as EU funds, including Structural Funds, in the struggle against AIDS, in practice this is not happening in several Member States. In relation to the Structural Funds, the leaders of civil-society organisations point to the impossibility of obtaining cofinancing. I think that both the Member States and the European Commission need to resolve this issue urgently. Thank you.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="28213" name="Marie-Hélène Aubert" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that, in spite of the as yet minimal progress made when it comes to access to treatment, the disease is, unfortunately, not on the decline. On the contrary: in our own countries, in particular, the epidemic has, rather, gained ground. We are therefore delighted about the consensus taking shape in this House concerning the need definitely to review the TRIPS agreement on access to medicines, since the arrangements provided for within the framework of the Doha round do not, unfortunately, at present permit real access to inexpensive medicines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being said, the problem of AIDS is not only a problem of funding and of access to medicines. It might even be said that the emphasis placed on access to medicines has no doubt eclipsed the need to go on ceaselessly promoting prevention, which is now in decline both in our own countries and everywhere else. It is therefore essential to resume the prevention and information campaigns via the media, enlisting the help of qualified personnel, as well as on the social and medical networks, with a view to raising people’s awareness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly – and this is something that you have pointed out and something that is no doubt the most difficult thing to achieve – we also need, if we are really to change the situation, to alter cultural practices when it comes to sexuality and, in particular, to protect women and enable women to protect themselves. Women now constitute 50% of patients, which was not the case at the beginning of the epidemic. They are also affected in an extremely brutal and violent way not only by cruel treatment and other practices that take place in time of war in conflict zones but also by rape, prostitution, trafficking in women and female sexual slavery – all scourges that help facilitate the growth of the epidemic. Consequently, the way in which the European Union promotes women’s rights and equality also constitutes a very effective way of combating the epidemic and focusing on the transmission of the disease from mother to child – a mode of transmission that is rarely mentioned at present.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Innovative solutions do exist in some countries – for example, Malawi - where, by proceeding on the basis of decentralisation so as to get closer to the people and by also arranging for an active role to be played by the patients themselves – those whose condition has been stabilised – extremely positive results are achieved. This even applies in extremely poverty-stricken countries. We must therefore make much further progress on all these levels.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="28975" name="Vittorio Agnoletto" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner’s speech sounds frankly rhetorical: it is full of fine statements, which are not matched by an equally positive role on the part of the European Commission. As the latest data from UNAIDS demonstrate, the number of HIV infections is continuing to grow and, in some countries, we are even seeing a fresh outbreak of the virus. Faced with all of this, patented drugs continue to be unaffordable, and the TRIPS agreements are creating an insurmountable obstacle to access to medicines, condemning almost three million people to death each year.</p>
      <p sl="it">The ones taking advantage of this situation are the multinational pharmaceutical companies, which recorded a 24% increase in their profits in 2005; these multinationals are protected by the US Administration, which has never stopped using its political and commercial weight to influence the negotiations on pharmaceutical patents. At multilateral level, the Bush administration’s agenda is aimed at making the safeguard clauses laid down by the TRIPS agreements unenforceable, clauses which, in the event of a health crisis, would allow the member countries to bypass intellectual property rights and to have access to lifesaving drugs.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, while the United States can be rightly accused of attacking one of the most basic human rights, that of health care, Europe certainly cannot consider itself blameless. The inertia shown by the Commission and the Member States when it comes to equipping themselves with a Community regulation that is genuinely able to implement the Doha Declaration must be well and truly condemned. Commissioner, you said that a few thousand Africans were receiving treatment, but, in Africa, 30 million people are HIV-positive, 6.5 million of whom require treatment. Tomorrow is World AIDS Day: global civil society is asking once and for all for politics to shoulder its responsibilities, which concern not only the issue of access to medicines but also the funding allocated to prevention and research programmes. The creation of an international market in generic medicines, supported by a new system of medical research geared towards people’s real needs, remains the crucial issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that it is crucial for the resolution on which the House will vote to commit the Commission and the Council to: 1) acknowledge the failure of the decision of 30 August 2003; 2) propose within the WTO to amend the TRIPS agreements and the new procedures for granting compulsory licences, which must be able to respond swiftly to health emergencies caused by the HIV epidemic; 3) allocate EUR 1 billion to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as was already requested by Parliament on 2 December 2004 and ignored by the Commission and the Council; 4) dedicate more resources to research into medicines designed to treat diseases specifically affecting the south of the world and oblige the private sector, which has always benefited from public research, to set aside a reasonable amount of its own research for these neglected diseases. Too much time and energy has been wasted on making false promises; it is now time to act!</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="28457" name="Luca Romagnoli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard many fine words and statements from the Commission, and a fair amount of demagogy from various Members. We are confronted here with actions that are not outlined in the Commission document, but that are nonetheless necessary.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact is, we must take a decisive stand in fighting the spread of drug use, which means zero tolerance, help and rehabilitation for those who are, to all intents and purposes, sick and should be treated as such. We should not praise sexual promiscuity, which the mass media and opinion leaders today regard and portray as the path to follow. We need a policy that educates people but that also discourages high-risk behaviour, and a policy of informed parenthood for those affected. We also need to launch a serious fight against prostitution, which we are very far from doing in our Europe, and we certainly also need to do more in terms of monitoring, testing and, of course, treating and preventing infectious diseases, as described in the document.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are not on the right track, however, Mr President, when I still hear my fellow Members and when I read speeches preaching ‘freedom’, freedom that, for society, means inertia and, for civilisation, in this case, means regression.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="28300" name="Zbigniew Zaleski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Like malaria and other diseases, the current situation regarding AIDS presents a wide range of challenges involving education, prevention, research, care and treatments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, proper sexual health education is needed, especially in poor countries. The issue is promiscuity arising due to social and economic circumstances, which I learned about, for example, on sugar cane plantations in the Dominican Republic. Economic conditions need to be improved, and social values and rules changed. This would create the right circumstances for positive changes in sexual behaviour and there would then be an end to morally controversial procedures on human foetuses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, scientific research may be expensive and often a financial risk, but it must be carried out: both vaccines and treatment against the viruses need to be found. For this reason international research groups must be supported.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, society needs to care for those afflicted by the virus, and especially for AIDS orphans whose unfortunate situation is the result of other peoples’ sexual behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fourthly, only a minute percentage of the 40 million individuals infected with the HIV virus currently has access to medication and medical aid. This is where we have the most opportunities to act. Medication can be made available to many more carriers if suitable policies are put in place.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="4480" name="Margrietus van den Berg" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the World Fund is already the biggest fund in the worldwide fight against the diseases in question, and I take pride in the fact that the EU accounts for 65% of the contributions to it. The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has made out a case for the World Fund and has committed to it, which is enormously laudable. Europe has a responsibility in respect of the rest of the world, and this Fund fleshes out this responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let me let you in on a big scandal, though. Next year, it looks like Mr Barroso will be unable to deliver on his promise to the World Fund. It appears that the money from the European Development Fund that was earmarked for the World Fund in 2007 has already been spent on other things. The Commission wants to plug this hole by extracting funds from the general development budget, which means removing funds from the budget for education, gender equality, the fight against poverty and hunger and the fight against child labour.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Surely, Mr President, this cannot be justified to all those people who rely on our support and on the undertakings we have given. How can the Commission ask us to choose between the fight against deadly diseases and all other things we stand for, which we have made provision for in the budget, on the one hand and the contributions to achieving the Millennium Objectives on the other?</p>
      <p sl="nl">In matters of life and death, it should not be a case of having to make choices. If you manage to set aside 1 billion for infrastructure and 3 billion for good governance from the European Development Fund for the next few years, then you may be able to scrape together 100 million annually for the World Health Fund.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, should free up this 100 million, not at the expense of education, child labour or care for women, but from the European Development Fund. Maybe we should allocate a little less for infrastructure and these other items. If you get your priorities right, you are on the right track; if not, you have neglected to do any sound forward planning and have, as a result, caused quite a bit of damage. I would call on the Commission to have another close look at this.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="28477" name="Fiona Hall" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">The availability of antiretroviral therapy does not just bring hope to AIDS sufferers themselves. It also transforms attitudes to AIDS in the wider population. The knowledge that effective treatment is available is a key factor in encouraging people to be tested for HIV. The more people are aware of their HIV status, the easier it is to control the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why it is particularly worrying that the price of new, improved and second-line AIDS medicines remains prohibitively high. It is good news that the price of some established first-line AIDS drugs has come right down, but figures from South Africa and Malawi indicate that up to one in six patients will need to switch to newer drug combinations within three to five years.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can the Commission do to persuade pharmaceutical companies to register their newer drugs in developing countries and make those newer drugs available at affordable prices? Failing that, we will soon be back to square one. The drugs that still work will be unaffordable and donors, including the EU, will effectively be donating to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-019" speaker_id="28409" name="Raül Romeva i Rueda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, we are still a long way from winning the fight against HIV-AIDS; all we need is political will, however.</p>
      <p sl="es">The numbers are clear: the vast majority of new infections occur in the developing countries, which means that HIV is one of the main factors slowing down the progress of thousands of settlements and communities.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are therefore talking about a global emergency, from both health and from social and economic points of view. We know what the problem is and we know how to prevent it and treat it. In order to do so, however, we need resources, political responsibility, responsibility on the part of economic sectors and social and cultural responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="es">For example, amongst other measures, we must guarantee universal access to vital medicines, something which is still not possible due to the greed of certain economic sectors, especially the pharmaceuticals sector, which has no scruples in this regard, and it therefore clearly shares responsibility for mass murder on a global scale.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, certain arguments from ultra-conservative sectors against sexual and reproductive health share responsibility for this situation. For example, given the information we have, to oppose appropriate sex education for everybody, particularly the youngest people, in this day and age, is, however you look at it, an affront against life and dignity, and is quite frankly immoral.</p>
      <p sl="es">This year once again, therefore, we must call for actions, for commitment, and above all we must demand that promises be kept.</p>

    <intervention id="4-020" speaker_id="23805" name="Zita Gurmai" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, we all know of the importance of the struggle against AIDS, and should be aware of our responsibility in this regard as well. It is to this that I attribute the fact that my opinion, submitted last week, has received so many proposed amendments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Last year there were nearly 40 million people on record living with AIDS, and the illness has truly reached every corner of the world. There are several reasons for its spread. Lack of information is first among these, but other important factors have been drug use and the lack of preparation on the part of some countries’ health care systems. In my own country, testing was introduced 20 years ago, and it is to this that we owe the fact that the situation is not bad, yet problems are nonetheless present. The virus is spread 90% through sexual contact and 10% through drug use.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Two further experiences: untreated sexually transmitted infections increase exponentially the risk of AIDS. People with HIV and AIDS find it much more difficult to obtain suitable medical care, if they are able to get any at all. The importance of prevention cannot be emphasised enough, and this includes information. This is especially important among highly vulnerable social groups and for secondary school students. We must take action. We have to help countries outside the Union as well, especially in neighbouring areas. The number of those diagnosed with the infection is constantly growing in some neighbouring countries. Reciprocal action is in the interests of us all. An integrated approach is needed, as the Commissioner has also stated, and we must take action. We all need to be partners in this effort.</p>

    <intervention id="4-021" speaker_id="28172" name="Pierre Schapira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution is a step in the right direction. I should like to add that the fight against AIDS is also an issue of governance, which must be dealt with at local level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would remind you that in 2007, that is to say at present, 50% of the world’s population live in cities. In many African cities, prevention and health care require local authorities to be involved in making those same cities more responsive to local needs and in removing social taboos, which are often very powerful. We must cooperate directly with the cities in order to help them manage their health services and in order to provide them with increased funding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should have liked our resolution to have put forward a larger number of practical solutions to be employed on the ground. We could have asked the Commission to make it easier to offer combined treatments in the form of medicines combining three types of remedy in one and the same capsule – an arrangement that would have greatly simplified the treatment of patients living in areas in which hospitals, medicines and laboratories are few in number. We must promote the use of such treatments, ladies and gentlemen, as we have a pressing duty: to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

    <intervention id="4-022" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a debate which has shed light on this serious, worldwide problem from a number of perspectives. I think I can say that no objections have emerged in the debate that would undermine the broad strategic value of this document, in terms of either the ideas in the statement or the definition of the areas for action and the goals we need to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should like to emphasise the fundamental idea that the only way to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic is with the kind of coordinated, holistic approach that is currently deployed in the fight against poverty, in other words, preventative mechanisms that incorporate cultural norms, education, common sense, screening and care for the sick, including appropriate treatment. I think it is safe to say that the current results cannot be regarded as a success. Neither can we view them as empty words, since the progress that has been made is not inconsiderable. As for the fund, there has been a significant amount of financing. The EU is also providing significant resources to finance a range of projects in all countries and there have been some successes. The TRIPS agreement has been mentioned. As of this year, medicines can be produced more cheaply. I mentioned the fact that there have been times when prices have fallen by 98%. This is indeed noteworthy progress, but in no way could it be called a success. There is no doubt that we need to redouble our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should now like to turn to two specific issues, which I feel require a particular response. It was mentioned – though I am not sure I have understood correctly – that in the new Member States there are no suitable centres monitoring this epidemic. This observation is untrue; these centres are everywhere. If we compared their quality of course, we might find that some are better than others. Under the European Treaty there are not many possibilities for direct control, but the idea that these centres do not exist has no basis in reality.</p>
      <p sl="cs">A further problem that was mentioned is the financing of the Fund against AIDS. The Commission has responded to the fact that the Member States are not contributing anything in 2007 by restructuring the resources. I think that one could debate whether this restructuring process has been carried out in the best possible manner, and whether different approaches might be considered, but I also think that the idea of restructuring was in essence a good one, because AIDS is a problem of massive proportions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In spite of this I believe that if Member States have undertaken to make certain contributions, which would not be significant amounts in relation to their GDP, they should fulfil that commitment. The overall amount of money is very significant, but in relation to GDP it is an amount that can be released in the context of national budgets. It is up to us to channel our efforts into reversing this unacceptable situation, because failure to do so would be unjustifiable and indefensible. I should also like to emphasise the importance of equal opportunities, which will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to overcoming this phenomenon and improving the situation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, it is a strange quirk of human nature that we push some things into the background and bring others to the foreground. Take avian flu, for example, and the attention devoted to it. I do not wish, in any way, to underplay that tragedy, but HIV/AIDS is obviously a vastly more significant problem and yet we are unfortunately not devoting the same level of attention to it.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this debate, which I feel has enabled us to advance further down this path. We must of course be aware that however much we channel all our efforts into resolving the problem, it is a worldwide problem and the chances of our making progress are thus limited. However, as the debate has clearly demonstrated, we must do all that we can to make use of those chances.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged European Union: the European Action Plan 2006-2007 (2006/2105(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-026" speaker_id="4541" name="Elizabeth Lynne" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to be Parliament’s rapporteur on the disability action plan. I worked closely with disabled people’s organisations, the Commission and fellow MEPs, and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for their cooperation. I should also like to thank the Secretariat and I extend my special thanks to the European Disability Forum. I also sought advice from another 100 disability organisations across the European Union. I sincerely hope the report reflects the fact that it was produced not just by me but by the whole committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcomed the Commission communication, but I felt there were some areas that could be strengthened. With regard to employment in particular, it is essential first and foremost to implement existing legislation, particularly the 2000 Employment Directive. I know the Commission is monitoring that closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, certain grey areas need to be clarified, such as reasonable accommodation or reasonable adjustment. It is also vital that trade unions inform people of their rights under anti-discrimination legislation. However, whatever we do in terms of employment, it is of little use to disabled people unless they have access to the built environment or to transport facilities. That is why one of my demands is further legislation on bus and coach travel, similar to that for air travel. I know the Commission is looking at that as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Education and training are also the key to integration. I have always said that Member States should work towards including children in mainstream education wherever possible, but, at the same time, recognising that some children may not thrive in that atmosphere, especially if there is no proper back-up. Children’s needs must come first.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to address access to information technology. That means accessible websites. At the moment, 80% of public websites are not accessible and we must ensure all documents are in accessible formats, particularly Commission and EU documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also ensure that disabled children and adults have access to sporting facilities. However, one of the most important areas is the deinstitutionalisation of disabled people, but this needs a sufficient level of Community-based quality services. We must also destigmatise people with mental health problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we talk about disability, we must remember that we are talking about all forms of disability: people with mobility problems, hearing impairments, visual impairments, mental health problems, learning disabilities, chronic illnesses and other, hidden, disabilities. That is why I called in my report for a definition of disability. I welcome the Court of Justice ruling of 11 July, but we must take this forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another milestone was agreement earlier this year on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, for which I was Parliament’s rapporteur. However, we must campaign now for the swift signing and ratification of the Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also continue our campaign for a specific disability directive under Article 13 to outlaw discrimination on access to goods and services. I make no apology for mentioning this repeatedly, and I have called for it in my report yet again.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no point in paying lip service to disabled people’s rights. We have to continue the fight for all EU citizens, disabled or non-disabled, to be treated equally.</p>

    <intervention id="4-027" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for including this important issue on the agenda of today's plenary session. I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission have very similar opinions on the issue of disability. I should especially like to thank Parliament for its support in developing and implementing the European strategy for the disabled.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This is not solely about providing disabled people with the opportunity to exercise their rights, the right to human dignity, to equal treatment, to freedom from dependence on others and to full integration in the community. Disabled people must be given the chance to develop their skills, to take part in the life of the community and to be economically active. The Commission action plan for equal opportunities for the disabled provides a strategic framework for establishing current priorities. As Mrs Lynne’s report emphasises, the Community’s policies and activities influence the situation of the disabled in a variety of ways. In 2003 the Council therefore recommended to the Member States that they comply in full with the action plan when drawing up their policies.</p>
      <p sl="cs">At the end of 2005, I attended a meeting on equal opportunities for the disabled, which launched the second phase of the EU action plan for the disabled 2006-7 and which is addressed in the Lynne report.</p>
      <p sl="cs">First let us look at where things currently stand. The figures available to the Commission tell their own story. There are 44.6 million people of working age – that is to say, every sixth EU citizen – with a long-term health problem or disability, according to their own assessment. Employment among the disabled is no more than 40%, as opposed to 64.2% among those without a disability. Even among those with disabilities that are relatively less serious, the employment rate is less than 50%. It has been established that the 43.7% of disabled people could work if they were given adequate assistance. The Commission’s programme for 2006-7 seeks to address this situation. On a practical level, resources must be created to enable the disabled to exercise their rights, to have the same chances to vote as those without a disability, to make decisions on their own lives, to take part in the economic activities of life, to fulfil their potential in their personal and working life and to perform their duties just like any other citizen.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Against this backdrop, four priority areas have been established for 2006-7. In its spring 2006 meeting, the Council also prioritised higher rates of employment and working activities for the disabled. The key point of next year’s European Action Plan must be access for the disabled to high-quality, affordable services. Disabled access to material values and services is absolutely vital to ensuring that they exercise their rights as citizens and to guaranteeing their independence. The Union must be capable of better analysing and identifying the development of factors influencing the situation of the disabled. This Action Plan has already yielded positive results. The first European legislation specifically relating to the disabled has been adopted. This law on the rights and obligations of the disabled in the area of air transport has been mentioned by the rapporteur. Legislation relating to the new structural funds guarantees the rights of the disabled to access to Community-funded projects and lays down that the principle of access must be upheld at all stages of the fund’s activity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The adoption of the UN Convention on the rights of the disabled is an event of historical significance. The European Community has for the first time in history signed up to the Convention. With this Convention the fundamental principles of the EU’s strategy on the disabled – namely, non-discrimination, equal opportunities and active measures aimed at social integration – have gained solid foundations.</p>

      <p sl="en">I will speak on this item, as our chairman, Mr Sifunakis, has other duties today. However, we and every member of the PSE working party in the Committee on Culture and Education agree on the subject’s importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The year 2007 will be the European Year of Equal Opportunities, as part of which we must also give attention to disability in education and culture programmes. The new digital technologies, especially relating to the media, can provide equal opportunities for the disabled. It is crucial to use these tools for the advantage of disabled people. The European Union has important multiannual cultural programmes between 2007 and 2013. Our group wants to increase the involvement of people with disabilities in these programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some weeks ago, I welcomed a group of visitors that included some disabled people. We, Members of this European Parliament, can also act at a personal level. Our possibilities may be modest, but we can invite more disabled visitors to Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European action plan 2006-2007 for people with disabilities identifies a strategy based on the principle of equal access to goods and services for every European citizen. This is a culture that is no longer associated with the idea of passive welfare but with the objective of integration, of active participation in economic and social life and of recognition for the safeguarding of these people’s rights. The theme of quality of life takes centre stage, such that people with disabilities may fulfil their expectations while keeping their human dignity. That is why we emphasise the importance, too, of the relationship between the state of people’s health and the environment in which they live.</p>
      <p sl="it">We support the formulation of the following three objectives: to finish implementing the directive on equal treatment in employment and working conditions; to do more to integrate disability-related issues in relevant Community polices; and to improve access for all. Our amendments have highlighted the need for a basically uniform approach in all of the Member States, in terms of transport and mobility, one that ensures that disabled people receive adequate support from the school and education system and within the home, and that also promotes sign language.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also crucial to highlight the need to establish and enforce high European standards on quality in the social services, because the quality and fullness of people’s lives in the future will depend on the quality of service that they receive. We therefore hope that ever more concrete, practical acts will follow on from the statement of principle. Finally, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her work.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the report by my honourable friend Mrs Lynne, whom I should like to congratulate on a cohesive and integrated piece of work, lays down the basic principles which the policy of the European Union and of the Member States needs to follow as far as disability is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to refer in particular to the safeguarding of accessibility for people with disabilities to the built environment. We need to remove the obstacles which prevent people with disabilities from participating in economic, social and cultural life. In precluding their natural access to goods and services, we are not only marginalising an important section of the populace, but also, at the same time, we are causing significant economic damage, as we are excluding them from the labour market and economic life in general, pushing them into a life on benefits, which cannot but be harmful.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition, although I consider that mainstream education is a fundamental right of people with disabilities and makes a decisive contribution to their unimpeded integration into society and towards combating stigma and discrimination, we must not overlook the need to support special education structures as and where necessary.</p>
      <p sl="el">Similarly, I should like to stress the importance of the problems of mental health and the handicaps it causes and to underline the need to promote the mental health of the populace.</p>
      <p sl="el">I also wish to mention and to add that the adoption of a common definition of disability at European level will greatly facilitate the recognition of the common issues of people with disabilities for the purpose of adopting policies at European level which will give greater added value to national social policies in a sector which still – to a significant degree – comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I wish to convey two points on behalf of my honourable friend, Mr Sifunakis, who drafted the opinion: firstly, the Commission must increase the involvement of people with disabilities in the new multi-annual programmes for the next budgetary period and, secondly, there must be a corresponding improvement in sports facilities.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, who have thoroughly studied and presented recommendations on one of today’s most pressing social issues – the full integration into our society of people with disabilities. I support the numerous recommendations of those who prepared the report, which show that today there are still quite a few problems in this area. I would like to draw attention to some of them. Modern information technologies, the Internet and digital television open entirely new possibilities for adapting information to each user, with regard to his/her needs and potentials. These include wider use of subtitles and sign language on television, specially adapted workstations for disabled people and suitably adapted Internet interfaces, especially for public websites. We must encourage and ensure that all these possibilities are implemented. When new buildings are being designed, appropriate attention should be paid to the disabled. In future, improved transport systems will increase the mobility of these people. It is essential that these specialised needs be considered each time, especially when European Regional Development Fund and Structural Fund grants are being put to use.</p>
      <p sl="lt">National law should be improved in parallel, removing all discriminatory provisions that are not in keeping with Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty. Further efforts should be made to renounce the medical model of disability and to replace it with a social model. It is most important that, in educating the public, all means adopted be accompanied by common efforts to eliminate stereotypes and preconceived notions in regard to the disabled. Only the coordinated and all-embracing efforts mentioned in the report will enable improved results to be obtained more rapidly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is crucial that the noble promises of the Commission and the Member States to defend the rights of the disabled do not remain just rhetoric. More effective action must be taken, the existing legislation in this area must be effectively complied with and human rights for all must be guaranteed. We commend the rapporteur Mrs Lynne on her work and wish to underline the importance of the recommendations contained in her report, to which we contributed some proposals.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would like to highlight the effective application of the legal framework for equal treatment in employment, access for all to public transport and to new information technology, and the elimination of architectural barriers. We once again call for a specific directive on disability to be drawn up, based on Article 13 of the Treaty, and for the UN Convention in this area to be ratified and signed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also wish to call for the Member States to focus more on disabled children and young people and their education, as well as the inclusion, wherever possible, of disabled students in mainstream education, taking account of the specific support required to meet the special educational needs of the pupils. Lastly, I should like to call for special focus on severely disabled people and their families.</p>

      <p sl="pl">On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I should like to thank Mrs Lynne for her excellent work. We are today dealing with an issue that is a measure of our humanity. Every time a disabled person is discriminated against, it is an attack on human rights and dignity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The concept of the disabled being able to enjoy their full rights as citizens must become more than fine-sounding words. It must be recognised that much has been achieved in this area over recent years. Nonetheless, it is still far too often the case that disabled people feel they are second class citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Integrating the world of disabled people with the rest of society represents a considerable challenge for the Member States. All kinds of barriers have to be removed. I mean here not only to the built environment and transport facilities, but also to access to work, medical care, social care, education, culture and sport for example. The issue of disability amongst children and young people is especially important. Disabilities can be physical, mental, acquired, or congenital. But I would also like to draw attention to the situation of those individuals who have become less able because of their advancing years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am confident that the action taken by this House on this matter will lead to improved living conditions. This is not charity. It is our duty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the report on the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged European Union is actually more of a wish list for improving the quality of life of the disabled than a factual account and analysis of their present situation. In addition to the obvious issues relating to the built environment and transport, action is urgently needed to provide financial support for employers and compensate them for the losses they incur by employing disabled people who are less productive in the workplace.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of ongoing support of the educational process for the disabled and their carers is both a tremendous opportunity and a problem for families with disabled members. Making it possible for parents to stay at home for the necessary time and awarding them financial support so that they can live with dignity would be a step in the right direction. The European Union ought to make a commitment in this regard and ensure that the necessary resources are available.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An order of priority for activities should be assigned to all guidelines aimed at improving the situation of the disabled, so that our aid and efforts do not become empty political declarations. In addition, the disabled need the certainty that the Member States of the Union are supporting them by imposing harsher punishments for offences against the disabled.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important day for this House and I would therefore like to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her report, because we are taking a further step in our task of building a Europe of opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="es">By means of a broad agreement, we shall approve new measures today that will represent progress in terms of equal opportunities for people with any kind of disability.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this new European Action Plan 2006-2007 is a great challenge in terms of eliminating any kind of discrimination and, furthermore, it tackles the needs of people with disabilities throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall highlight several issues. Firstly, it intends to establish a general framework for equal treatment in work, not just in terms of education and access, but also promotion and lifelong learning.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, it undoubtedly improves the conditions and rights for passengers with disabilities using air, sea and land transport. I must warn you, however — as I have done in the report — of the need not to create a new and so far non-existent barrier: the economic barrier. To oblige people with disabilities to be accompanied is positive in terms of improving the quality of their journey, but it would not be a positive thing for the disabled person to have to pay for the ticket of the person accompanying them, since that would mean those people having to pay for two tickets, while the rest of us would only have to pay for one.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, the improvement in access to new technologies. There is no question that new technologies should break down many barriers for people with disabilities, provided that we achieve universal access to them and provided that technological advances take these people into account from the outset of their design stage.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fourthly, we need integrated and coordinated responses to disability amongst children and amongst people who are already suffering other forms of discrimination, such as women and the elderly.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the prevention of work risks. We have opted for a broad agreement on work-related risks, which has already been presented in this House, and which the Commission has not yet taken up — and I would remind you of this, Mr Špidla — and in which particular attention will have to be paid to the possible risks faced by people in the workplace.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to stress the extremely important role played by disabled people’s associations.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no question that this is a great challenge and that it represents progress towards achieving the Europe of opportunities that we all want to see.</p>

    <intervention id="4-037" speaker_id="2073" name="Richard Howitt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">I join with the rapporteur in reiterating Parliament’s support for a comprehensive non-discrimination directive on disability under Article 13. The Portuguese Presidency promised it to us in 2000, as did the former Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs in 2003. Four years later and unless there is action, the Commission will continue saying that there is a hierarchy of discrimination, which none of us can accept.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I welcome the action plan’s emphasis on moving beyond employment rights to social care. I call on the Commission to undertake this work with a genuine spirit and commitment towards an independent lifestyle for people with disabilities, to the right to personal assistance and to the right for disabled people and disabled children and their parents to choose mainstream provision, whether that is education or housing, not only employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we can do much more on the international front in external assistance. We claim to adopt a human rights approach to disability. Let us do more within our human rights programmes worldwide. We have not done enough regarding the human rights of disabled people in assessing candidate countries for accession to the European Union. We can do better in that area. We should not only move swiftly to ratify and sign the draft UN Convention on People with Disabilities but work with third-country governments to make sure they do too.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally on PPE-DE Group’s Amendment 5, I am outraged that the Conservatives should try to withdraw the part of my text suggesting that the Commission should be required to monitor the participation of people with disabilities in their programmes. We should not just talk about participation, we should make it happen. The PPE-DE Group should withdraw that amendment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Union is a society of shared values. One way by which we judge our success as a society is how we address the issues facing the most vulnerable members of our society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year, as rapporteur on the Commission paper on demographic change, I was invited to speak at a special conference on disability in Graz during the Austrian Presidency. The banner on the platform behind me said simply: Leben wie andere auch – to live the same as other people. In English the translation of the word ‘leben’ is not just ‘to live’ but ‘to have a life’, and it should be the aim of our society to help all members of society to live and to have a life like every other member of society.</p>
      <p sl="en">UK Conservatives are not persuaded that we need more EU legislation to secure this aim, but we do believe that we need the whole of society to embrace it. We need not just a welfare state, but a welfare society, in which communities recognise their responsibilities for the support of all members of those communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Governments cannot do everything, but they can become enablers of individual choice, helping people with disabilities to do what they themselves want to do by removing the barriers that stand in their way – barriers in education, employment or simply in getting from A to B. Governments can also promote and enable a culture of independence rather than dependence. Support for people with disabilities is not just about care: it is about support for their desires to fulfil their lives and to live in the same way as other people.</p>

In most places even basic, unobstructed mobility has not been made possible, not to mention social integration. It is important for this to be made known: independent living does not only mean that one is simply a member of society, but that one is just as much a member of society as anyone else. Every policymaker and decision-maker should give this matter due consideration.</p>
      <p sl="hu">People living with disabilities make up 10% of Europe’s population, and therefore their integration and ability to function is not merely a social question but a mutual interest, since the creation of workplaces for disabled people, and their involvement in lifelong education and vocational training contributes not only to improving their living conditions, but to the development of the economy of Europe as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finding an approach to the question is problematic as well, and not only because statistical data in this area are inadequate. People with disabilities certainly constitute a diverse, far from homogeneous group, and therefore the numerous challenges in this area require an integrated, gender-based approach; this point must be taken into consideration at every level of policymaking. What is more, as in many other areas, the situation of women living with disabilities is often more disadvantaged than that of men with disabilities, and women are more often the victims of poverty and social exclusion. This must be taken into consideration in the wide range of programmes and measures.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The June List believes that it is completely unacceptable for people with disabilities to encounter prejudices, unhelpful special treatment and limited opportunities. Such experiences are not in accordance with our view of the EU as a union of values.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The European Parliament’s and the Council’s Regulation of 5 July 2006 constitutes progress, then, and clarifies something that should be self-evident, especially since we have a common internal market: namely, that people with disabilities should have the same rights as other citizens where flying is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Sweden is a pioneering country when it comes to the rights of people with disabilities. Far-reaching EU legislation, involving detailed perspectives on how people with disabilities are to be treated, might have placed a question mark over the successful Swedish reforms of the Seventies and Eighties. Let us, then, do without detailed regulation and instead state clearly and unambiguously that society, trade and industry and the rest of us as individuals should treat people with disabilities exactly the same as other people.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let us, in conclusion, practise some self-criticism. The EU institutions present reports on the rights of people with disabilities but cannot, at the same time, ensure that all EU buildings are fully adapted for their purposes. Nor are the European Union’s websites and documents accessible in suitable formats to people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired. When do the Quaestors in the European Parliament and the relevant EU authorities intend to take action on these urgent issues of such close concern?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0384/2006) by Mrs del Castillo Vera, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Time to move up a gear – Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth (2006/2138(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently debating a report that is going to be voted on this morning and which deals jointly with a number of reports presented by the Commission with one fundamental and very well defined objective, which is no less than to establish a range of measures enabling us to develop a knowledge-based society and economy in Europe, which is ultimately the fundamental instrument for generating employment and growth and therefore prosperity for all Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this report, like other reports by experts, such as the Aho report, which is an extremely complete and precise report dealing with the same issues, or other previous Commission reports, we are being presented with a situation in which we have a very good diagnosis ― I would say ― of where we are, why we are in this situation and what we need. There is probably no other area in which we have such precise knowledge as in this one, allowing us to promote growth in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have a diagnosis and we also have the solutions. We all know that in order to promote a knowledge-based society we need to promote innovation. We all know that we need to promote training so that people can adapt to all the changing situations in employment and can recycle themselves and find new kinds of work. We all know that innovation is necessary so that the social welfare system does not lose its capacity to meet the citizens' needs in terms of health, training, etc. We all know, too, that companies need a favourable framework, a framework that helps them, that encourages them to develop innovation and that prevents them from having to deal with bureaucratic problems, with difficulties in a whole range of fields of action.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is not the time to list each of the aspects of the report, because they are there and you all know about them. I would like to take this opportunity to place as much emphasis as I can on the need to stop all the talk once and for all and to stop giving reports and analyses wonderful titles, while there is still a degree of paralysis in the national States' actions. The step that has been taken in relation to the 25 national reform programmes is important, but I believe that we should place extremely great emphasis on a very thorough assessment of the progress made with those national programmes.</p>
      <p sl="es">As time passes, we are being left further and further behind. When the Lisbon Agenda was drawn up, there were expectations in terms of how things would develop. At the half-way point in the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda, the European average — the situations vary from country to country, of course — was worse than when the Lisbon Agenda was drawn up. We may find that in 2010 we have still failed to make any progress and that we have therefore got further and further behind. I truly believe that if we were to hire an external auditor, they would be amazed to see what a good diagnosis we have, and what good remedies and solutions we have, but that, in spite of that, there has been such a complete lack of action in their application.</p>
      <p sl="es">Like life itself, societies are created by means of cooperation amongst different generations. One generation carries the baton; it is like a relay race, but it is our foundations that are being passed on. Many Europeans are currently growing up and being born. Others, like ourselves, will be retired before too long. All of us need a society in which Europe can continue to have that capacity to compete, to have the leadership and sense of future that it has had in the past, because Europeans used to be determined, with their hearts and souls, to leave a better legacy for the future of their countries and, in our case, for the future of all of the countries making up European society.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is our responsibility, therefore, and we must put our hearts and souls into it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity to participate in this debate on growth and employment policy and we are quite clear in welcoming the present report. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, most warmly for her thorough and objective consideration of the issues involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are having this debate a few days before the Commission’s decision on the progress report on growth and employment policy in 2006. I share Mrs del Castillo Vera’s analysis that we, in Europe, do in fact know perfectly well where our problems are. We also know exactly what needs to be done. We have the right answers to the problems but – and this is where Mrs del Castillo Vera got it quite right – there is a problem with the implementation of the measures deemed correct, in particular at the national level. It is also easy to explain why.</p>
      <p sl="de">The long-term needs for reform that we have identified for European growth and employment policy always come up against the short-term interests of national politics. There are always elections somewhere. The machinery always grinds to a halt somewhere. Even so, I am in a position to tell you today that the progress report that we will be adopting in a fortnight will be sending out two uncommonly positive signals.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first signal is that, for the first time, we actually have a functioning mechanism in Europe to coordinate the economic policies of the Member States and the EU itself. That, of course, was the big problem with the Lisbon Strategy, as you identified, in that while its aims were very ambitious, its implementation mechanism was practically non-existent.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second positive answer is that the priorities of the Member States have changed to a noticeable degree. We will be able to show in our reports, which cover every single country and every single sector of the economy, that the issues in our strategy are now on the agenda all over Europe. These issues are education and training, research and development, innovation, better conditions for businesses, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, and improving the employability of those social groups denied access to the labour market. These issues are all the hottest topics on the political agenda in every Member State, and so I am very pleased that the report under discussion today has very clear things to say on precisely these subjects. I would like to emphasise in the clearest possible way how much I welcome the fact that this report so clearly endorses Commission policy in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises and to innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to state very clearly that the future of our growth and our jobs depends on our success in bolstering the innovation potential in small and medium-sized enterprises such that they are able to contribute more and more to growth and employment in Europe. It is from this sector that the extra jobs that we need will come, and so it is important that all of our policies are assessed in respect of whether or not they allow Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises the leeway they need.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will very soon be in a position to debate the state of growth and employment policy on the basis of the Commission’s progress report. I am fairly sure, Mrs del Castillo Vera, that, when that happens, you will share my opinion that Europe is not in a state of stagnation. We are, rather, clearly moving in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union definitely needs renewed impetus in order to bridge that gap, that divide that exists in relation to the world’s other strong, dynamic, competitive economies: I am not just referring to the traditional ones, but to the new ones, too, which have made an appearance on the international stage. Europe is therefore risking a great deal if it is unable to keep pace and to modernise by giving itself that impetus and that extra something that is being requested of it, not least through this debate. It is in danger of losing that compatibility that it has always been able to demonstrate between economic, productive and industrial growth and, at the same time, social cohesion and the ability to promote employment and a more inclusive kind of growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that this ‘extra something’ requires two elements. Firstly, we need to take action regarding new factors of economic and employment growth: human capital, the training of human capital, the enhancement of people’s abilities and skills, and technological innovation, which is also understood to mean the ability to transfer the results of research and of what knowledge today places at our disposal into production processes. There is a second element, however, which I should like to mention in closing, and which is key to overcoming this challenge: Europe needs to work together more! Europe needs to provide itself with this strategic ability that is a common outlook. Twenty-five national plans are weakening our ability to grow together: we need one outlook, a more univocal outlook. We need, in short, more harmonised policies in the fields of taxation, of employment and of industrial policies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in olden times young people learned their professions in the workshops of older masters. In Hungary, before the World Wars and the Iron Curtain, many young people went to western Europe for some years to extend their vocational training by working in the workshops of foreign masters. In this way, they learned both their profession and one or two foreign languages.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not invent new things, we should just remember the old traditions. Of course, times have changed and the state has an important role in vocational training. However, as with the individual masters or guilds in the old times, small and medium-sized companies should be involved in providing practical experience for students. Our projects in the field of vocational training are rather modest. We must provide more financial resources for programmes that provide foreign experience and possibly the exchange of students.</p>
      <p sl="en">Vocational training should also provide language courses, including business technology phrases. It is nice to learn the Hamlet monologues by heart, but carpenters or computer operators should know their professional terms in foreign languages as well.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, and thank her for all the work undertaken on an issue of such great importance for the future of the European economy. We are unfortunately bound to recognise that the European Community’s economic results are consistently disappointing, particularly when we take into account the opportunities offered by the single European market. Particular attention should be paid to the difficulties experienced by small and medium-sized enterprises. After all, SMEs are among the powerhouses of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Better regulation and simplification are crucial to increasing the cohesion and clarity of Community legislation and would help to reduce the administrative burden weighing so heavily on SMEs. Future legislative proposals should adopt a broad and comprehensive approach based on detailed consideration of current legislation and an in-depth assessment of the implications. There should be regular contact with SMEs and the organisations representing them so that they can be involved in the implementation and further development of Community programmes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, first of all, allow me to thank our rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, and to congratulate her on her excellent report, especially since it is structured around clear sets of themes designed to improve monitoring of the Lisbon Strategy. I think, moreover, that one issue in particular ought to get us moving: that of reviewing the Community Patent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For too long, we have been saying, as Mrs del Castillo Vera said just now, that it is crucial for innovation to be promoted via harmonisation at European level. Now, what we are saying needs to be heard. We talk about producing better legislation, and the scope of such legislation is vast. There is also, however, cause to be surprised that Europe is so far behind in terms of innovation. Bearing in mind, however, that a patent costs on average EUR 46 700 in Europe compared with EUR 10 250 in the United States, I think that we know, unfortunately, why this is so. Charging as much as that is the best way of stifling innovation in Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises. This cost is utterly prohibitive. It is therefore a matter of urgency to get the Council to think again and help extricate our companies from this unfortunate situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should now also like to emphasise another important point that we ought to have taken up in this report, namely the Agreement on Public Procurement. In the process of being reorganised under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, this Agreement offers the 36 signatories, including our 25 Member States, access to their partners’ public procurement markets. Nonetheless, a number of these partners are not playing by the rules. One has only to look at what the United States and Canada do. By means of national provisions, they exclude from the scope of the Agreement those public procurement markets that they reserve for their SMEs, even though these countries can put themselves forward in the public procurement markets of the 25 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I find it unacceptable that the progress made in transatlantic relations is all in the same direction. We therefore have a duty to promote a European Small Business Act on the model of that in place in the United States since 1953. We might be said to be 50 years behind. You will agree that enough is enough. It remains for us to come up with better legislation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we keep on reminding ourselves, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of Europe’s economy, employing most of Europe’s workers, yet still not without their problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want to point out that the first communication from the Commission in which many problems were addressed reached us in July 1994, followed by recommendations in December of the same year, a second communication in 1998, and then, in 2000, experts found out that not even half of the measures were being put into effect in the Member States. It is necessary to note that, even today, only 55% of them have been, so the Member States have to back up their words with actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say something about the transfer of undertakings, which is an important matter to which too little attention is given when considering the problem as a whole, not only on the part of the authorities responsible for Member States’ tax laws but also by the enterprises themselves, which have to start work in good time on the business of transferring their enterprise to a new owner.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is work to be done by all parties involved. Not least in the Seventh Research Programme, this House has taken action in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises; enough words have been bandied back and forth, so now is the time for some action.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the preparation of her speech. Essentially I agree with her. This is yet one more document among a multitude of others that should encourage entrepreneurship in Europe – starting with the expansion of small and medium-size enterprises. Indeed the Community’s policy on this question is consistent and, I would say, fair. The problem is that in real life it is often not observed. Laws are frequently ignored and bureaucratic obstacles are created. I would like to point out two problems: I think the success of small and medium-size enterprises depends on their solution. Firstly, there is a problem with business registration procedures. The Commission has promised that by the end of 2007 the so-called One-Window Principle would be implemented in the entire Community. At the Summit Meeting in March, the Member States also agreed to simplify registration procedures for new enterprises. It was agreed that they should not take longer than one week. However, in reality business registration in some Community countries now takes from one day to several weeks. Registration costs also differ markedly. In certain countries it does not cost anything, yet elsewhere the cost can amount to hundreds of euros.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The second problem – control over the activities of enterprises, overseen by various State institutions. In Lithuania at the present time, 152 controlling bodies are in operation. Business people mention this as one of the biggest problems and sources of corruption. Recently 300 Commission employees made a commitment that by 2009 they would work for at least one week in small and medium-size enterprises. That way they will attempt to understand the problems. This is a welcome and concrete step. Perhaps similar initiatives should be extended to other parts of Europe, but would the Community endorse them? I am certain that we will have to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to business expansion. Then we will be able to say that we are creating Europe through business and that we are encouraging its growth.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you. I have no doubt that achievements in innovation, the skill to make use of them and the capacity to revive the entrepreneurial environment, particularly in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, will establish Europe’s place in global economic competition. Europe must adopt a proactive and leading position on global economic and social regulation. Thus, for example, if we wish to catch up with the USA in the sphere of innovation where, according to an assessment by the European Commission, we are currently lagging behind by 50 years, it is vital to change existing relations between science and business, and between business and the regulatory role of the state, as well as the models for funding science. Restrictions, not lack of enterprise, are the reason why the majority of Europe’s residents want to be employees and not employers. We welcome the report’s emphasis on the role of the common market in fostering entrepreneurial activity. The spheres in which the common market is not functioning properly are services and the free movement of labour. A task that is behind schedule in the promotion of the free movement of labour is achieving comparability between Member States’ degrees and qualifications, which has become particularly topical following the 2004 enlargement and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. I hope that the report will stimulate MEPs to rethink and understand the errors that have crept in, not least in the recently adopted services directive, and in rejecting the introduction of the European patent. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, just for a moment I should like to test our wonderful interpreters. ‘European Union entrepreneurship’ is an oxymoron, is it not? The whole raison d’être – if I may lapse into the vernacular of this place – is to stifle small business. Rule upon rule, regulation upon regulation are generally made by people with no commercial experience at all. I went through the list of over 700 MEPs just yesterday, and I could not find more than about 5 people who had bona fide business experience.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commissioners go on the Microsoft yacht for their holidays, the British Prime Minister has close relations with Lord Browne of BP, and so on and so forth, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with business.</p>
      <p sl="de">Business in Western Europe is millions upon millions of small businessmen and women living a life of quiet desperation, trying to put their livelihoods together. Small businesses account for over 52% of the UK’s GDP.</p>
      <p sl="de">You tell us in this place what age we may recruit at; you tell us what colour they may be; you tell us how much leave they must have; you tell us how much their pensions will be. It goes on and on. If we really wanted to get this place sorted out and we really wanted entrepreneurship, I would suggest that we only have Commissioners and MEPs who have actually done an honest day’s work in their lives.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wonder how many people in this Chamber have had an idea for a new business, raised the money themselves at their own risk and successfully run that business for 20 more years and generated jobs and wealth. I see that not a hand goes up, and yet here we have a Commission talking about authorising entrepreneurs and about level playing fields – which is the most fundamental contradiction of the word ‘entrepreneur’ you could possibly imagine. The whole point about entrepreneurship is creating something that nobody has ever thought of before.</p>
      <p sl="en">There sits the Commissioner talking about criminalising the use of imperial measurements on exports from the UK after 2009. As a consequence of that, the manufacturers of tyres, bicycles, clothing, medical equipment, dairy products, frozen foods, specialist papers, domestic appliances, hand tools, computer components and oil and gas components will all suffer, every single one of them. One of them in my constituency will be faced with going out of business because there is no way he will be able to sell his components to the oil and gas industry in the United States. They are not going to pull their drill up thousands of feet just to check a measurement – no way! He will either become a criminal to stay in business or he will go out of business.</p>
      <p sl="en">Years ago I walked into the office of one of the biggest industrialists in the United States and behind him was a notice that said: ‘If you are not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem, so get out of the way!’ That is a message I commend to this House.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, there are many reasons why the European Union loses out when competing with other countries. It does badly against both highly industrialised and developing countries. I cannot run through all the factors involved, but the main ones are inadequate support for SMEs and inadequate investment in science and education.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would, however, like to focus on a different aspect today, namely the very marked differences in development within the European Union, at both national and regional level. If we are to create a genuine European scientific and technological area, we will first have to bridge the gap between the richer and poorer Member States. This obviously calls for additional resources, by which I mean not just the structural funds or funds allocated to agriculture, but also to resources for research and development, science and education.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the richer countries have managed to secure almost all the funding set aside for such purposes, arguing that they are more effective in these areas. It should therefore come as no surprise that the differences between the rich and poor parts of the Union are becoming more rather than less marked, and that the European Union is developing at a significantly lower rate than the United States or the Asian countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two more things I should like to say.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first is that, however much one might wish to go along with the criticism of the conditions – and the Commission, as you know, does not hold back when criticism is merited – there is one thing that should not be overlooked, and that is that Europe’s economic statistics show an upward trend. Growth this year has surpassed expectations by far; a fall in unemployment is making itself very definitely felt; European firms are producing more, and we are becoming very much aware that the Member States’ priorities are changing as they become keener to improve the conditions for entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, when compared with – for example – the United States, it is indeed the case that there are fewer people in Europe who are prepared to set up a business themselves or to run one, or – to put it in the way a Member did a moment ago – to take upon themselves the risk of using their own money to create jobs for others. The causes underlying this are very interesting, and are to be found in our culture. It is for that reason too that the Commission has been such an energetic advocate of coupling together entrepreneurship and education; as early as at school and university, it must be possible to guide young people towards entrepreneurial activity. Remarkable successes are making themselves visible in the countries in which this is being done, while, in those where it is not, there are quite simply too few enterprises, and the plain and simple fact is that no jobs will be created in the absence of a business to create them.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we are currently learning – and it is a matter of considerable interest – is that ‘learning by doing’ is still the best way to go about it. Reference has already been made in this debate to the ‘Enterprise Experience’ project, which I started with the aim of getting all the senior civil servants from my own offices to work in a small or medium-sized enterprise for at least a week. The first fifty to do so have now got back, and the results are fascinating. Every one of them – and yes, I really do mean every one of them – has come back with important proposals for improvements, for ways in which we can make life easier for small and medium-sized businesses, and these deserve to be the subject of serious discussion. On the other hand, though, the firms that took our official on and enabled these to work for them say that they learned a great deal from it and now have a far better idea of what is feasible at the European level and of what is not.</p>
      <p sl="de">I really do want to encourage the Member States to take similar initiatives. Businesses change so quickly that it is absolutely necessary that those who create the conditions under which they operate should have a real knowledge, derived from their own observations, of what actually goes on in them and of what effect what they do has on them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mrs del Castillo Vera on the subject of entrepreneurship and growth. This report is an essential contribution to achieving the objectives laid down in the relaunched Lisbon Strategy, designed to make Europe the most competitive region in the world by refocusing on growth and employment while maintaining the balance between the three pillars of the process: the economy, the social dimension and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the EU wants successfully to meet this enormous challenge to bring about growth and employment, it needs to take account of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which, let us not forget, account for 70% of the total number of jobs in Europe, with 75 million workers. Having constructed the internal market by taking an interest in consumers at the same time as relying on competition, the EU must from now on take an interest in producers and, while protecting us from the harmful aspects of globalisation, ensure that European creativity is given full rein. Finally, I deplore the fact that the disastrous monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has not been criticised, as monetary policy is not being put sufficiently at the service of economic growth.</p>

I am therefore satisfied, since there is no sense in voting on an amendment that has already been accepted.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second part of the other amendment has been declared inadmissible, that is to say the part that specifies today’s date, 30 November, as the deadline for destroying embryos used for the procurement of stem cells. I do not agree with the declaration of inadmissibility, against which I can unfortunately do nothing. What remains of the article is the replacement of the word ‘extraction’, as it features in the common position, with the word ‘use’, as Parliament was proposing back at the stage of first reading.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is an issue of secondary importance, although, with the Commissioner having stated last night that, throughout the entire development phase of the programme, the Commission would accept the word ‘use’ and not the word ‘extraction’ – which, in practice, means that it will not fund any research into the destruction of embryos – I feel that this is a proposal that deserves to be endorsed.

      <p sl="pt">The present fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Cape Verde sets out the fisheries opportunities for the Community fishing fleets for 2006 to 2011. It is an important agreement for tuna fishing industry and grants fishing licences for the seven Portuguese surface longliners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore voted in favour of this report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This agreement, in common with other fishing agreements with third countries, also raises important issues, however, as regards the economic viability of long-distance fishing fleets and the actual fishing opportunities granted in their field, given that the commercial nature of these agreements is constantly changing, and the partnership and development dimension has been strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There has been an immediate increase in the cost of the agreement, in the context of fewer fishing opportunities, not least due to cuts in the number of licences granted. On the other hand, the cost to shipowners has gone up from EUR 25 to EUR 35 per tonne of tuna caught in seiners and longliners. These conditions have exacerbated the difficulties experienced by shipowners in using these licences to supply the industry at national level, and in the increasing external deficit regarding fishing products.</p>

There can only be partial compensation for closure, and that will be for the lignite power plants, the dirtiest possible source of energy. Thus, aid sought in the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would be spent on switching from a cleaner technology to a dirtier one.

A majority in this House decided today that Bulgaria can join the EU in 32 days’ time. Although nobody is enthusiastic, the opinion that another year’s delay will not solve anything now prevails.

I therefore welcome the provisions that point, albeit in a very general form, to the need for subsidiarity, and cultural self-determination at the very least, with the funding of complete mother tongue-education schemes for citizens of ethnic Hungarian background. I believe that the Copenhagen Criteria stipulating the rights of ethnic minorities have not been consistently enforced, as evidenced by the reported scandal at Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj where three lecturers lost their jobs on Monday for merely demanding that the university’s premises be designated in multiple languages. This gives a very bad signal, all the more so as Romania will be assuming responsibility in the Commission for multilingualism in the EU. Following the accession of Romania, that country’s problems will be an additional burden on the external and internal security of the EU. The Commission’s move to establish monitoring and systematic evaluation with the possibility of using the safeguard clauses is a very sensible decision.</p>

These countries should have been required to make much more progress before they were offered EU membership, a process that might have taken a good number of years.</p>

The EU must have a common labour market with freedom of movement for workers.

      <p sl="de">I really do think it cause for shame that the Commission's statement should, as soon as today, be called into question or be made subject to an interpretation that actually does raise the question as to why, if what Mr Busquin said is indeed the case, the Commission made the statement in the first place? Yet that is what it did do, and many Member States have taken a stand on it in order to exclude outright the possibility of Member States, such as, for example, the Federal Republic of Germany, being required, whether directly or indirectly, to cofinance a type of research that, in Germany, is very definitely illegal. That, and nothing else, was what this statement was intended to do.

Moreover, the Commission confirmed that it will remain faithful to current practice, and will refrain from submitting proposals to the regulating committee that involve research activities in which human embryos are destroyed, not least when this involves the extraction of stem cells. Whilst this research stage is excluded from funding, the Community has committed to funding the subsequent research stages, involving human embryonic stem cells’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has voted for these amendments in ‘Ideas’ and ‘Capacities’. With regard to ‘Cooperation’, however, the shadow rapporteur has indicated a free vote, which we are also happy to accept.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Obviously, our Eurocrats never learn. Having been alarmed by the unceremonious arrival on the Spanish and Italian coasts of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants taking advantage of the absence of border controls in order to enter European territory and having bitterly noted Europe’s powerlessness to manage such situations, we now hear Mr Cavada, taking up where Mr Sarkozy left off, proposing to us that, by activating the bridging clause, we do away with the unanimity rule in the Council and so reduce by a still further degree the Member States’ power to make decisions about their migratory flows.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not a Europe organised on federal lines that will be able to reduce cross-border crime.

Whilst we welcome the EP's demand on the importance of launching a wide debate on how to improve our effectiveness in this field, both procedurally and in practice, we nevertheless recognise and respect the significance for Member States in Council of agreeing how best to take this agenda forward.

However, the inability to prevent and combat the illness persists as a parameter which reproduces the poverty and misery of the populace in less capitalistically developed countries, resulting in further exploitation, especially of the natural wealth. In addition, the huge spread of the illness in less capitalistically developed countries constitutes a source of the spread of the illness worldwide, with serious repercussions on world public health. The fundamental approach to the problem of AIDS is based on resolving this political and economic issue for the benefit of the peoples.</p>

We refute and condemn the substitution of public and permanent health services by non-governmental organisations and the philosophy of voluntary supply and individual responsibility being promoted internationally as a solution to public health problems. The states in which there is a health system must orientate themselves towards the creation of permanent public infrastructures and services at all stages, with suitable scientific personnel and primary health care as the main objective. They can also be supported by international financing, with management responsibilities vested in international health organisations, and cooperation and assistance can be established at scientific and practical level globally between nations.</p>

In 2005, 40 million people were living with HIV, approximately 95% of them in developing countries, placing an impossible burden on the health system and economy in general.

I would particularly like to stress the importance of employment for the disabled and, through employment, the chance to avoid social isolation. It is very important that work should also be available to people with mental disability or people with multiple disabilities, in accordance with their capacities. Therefore, it is essential not only to implement the Council’s Directive establishing the general basis for a uniform attitude to employment and the professional field, but also to prepare a special Directive regarding disability and to create a common European definition of disability. In addition, it is important to initiate information campaigns and community and employer education regarding the employment of disabled people as quickly as possible.

Information campaigns should be devised to encourage employers to give unprejudiced consideration to taking on people with disabilities, particularly in the light of false notions about the financial cost of this type of employment and about the abilities of candidates.

The same can be said for the ‘inevitability’ of raising the retirement age, which undermines the rights of workers and of young people looking for work in an increasingly sparse labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Lastly, it sets great store by private-public partnerships, which, as a rule, are a way of handing on a plate to the private sector important areas that, given their social nature, belong in the public domain. Hence our vote against the report.</p>
