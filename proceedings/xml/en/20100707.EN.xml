      <p sl="unknown">Before we begin, I should like to make the following statement.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Today marks the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the public transport system in London, which killed 52 people and injured nearly 800. We remember what happened on 7 July 2005 in London, and we will never forget. On this day especially, our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The bombings in London were one of the worst acts of terror perpetrated on European soil. Let me say to bombers and terrorists: no matter what they do, they cannot win because we value every single life. No terrorist or terrorist action will ever be able to diminish or destroy our faith in core values such as fundamental and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Terrorism is an attack on all of us, an attack on the very fabric of our democratic society. It can never be justified. Europe will always stand united in its fight against terrorism of all kinds.</p>

    <intervention id="3-013" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Yves Leterme" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Deputy Secretary of State, and, of course, Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, allow me to address my congratulations to our Dutch friends, in so far as they are awake yet. I hope for fair play and that the better team emerges victorious in the final.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, a European final, who would have believed it only a few weeks ago? In any event, from the other side of the world, European footballers are an example of excellence, courage, self-confidence and determination to win.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, seen from the outside, Europe has every reason to be happy. The European Union’s success has helped spread peace and a democratic system of government across almost our entire continent. With its common market, the European Union has created unprecedented prosperity. It is true, however, that this Europe does not manage, or too seldom manages, to be happy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Undoubtedly, ladies and gentlemen, you have also been able to observe in Asia, for example, the extent to which energy, ambition, self-confidence and confidence in the future are practically tangible. America, for its part, still believes in itself, despite its problems. And, lastly, holding the football World Cup in South Africa sends a clear signal to Africa and sends out a clear signal from it, a real shot in the arm.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe, on the other hand, unfortunately too often seems to have lost its faith in the future. We need to give Europe its confidence back, to restore ambition for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, our action, Mr President, is intended to be part of this ambition, an ambition that you certainly share.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is all the more necessary to get Europe moving again since the rest of the world is not waiting for us. Panta rei : everything flows. If there is one constant in our world, it is permanent and high-speed change – technological change, economic change and change in balances of power across the globe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this changing world, where new centres of economic and political power are emerging, Europe is facing huge challenges. We, the Belgian Presidency, have structured the five lines of action of our Presidency around these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first challenge for Europe is clearly to restore sustainable economic growth. This revival, of course, hinges on strengthening financial stability. We must restore our financial and economic stability, re-establish budgetary discipline, without hindering the economic recovery, and get back on the path towards annual growth of at least 2%. We need this growth to finance our social model, this particular European model to which we all are still very much attached. We also need growth to establish our international credibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, a banking crisis for which we were not responsible has drawn us into a harsh recession, which we are struggling to emerge from more than other continents. The European Commission has proposed several initiatives to arm us against financial adventurism, against a repetition of the abuse that has had such severe consequences, both for our Member States and for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We share your ambition to complete the new supervisory system for financial institutions as quickly as possible, and the structure for alternative investment funds such as hedge funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This week, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have, once again, debated this at length. I also believe that today, you are going to adopt your amendments on supervision, but in doing that, I believe that you are also creating the opportunity to continue the dialogue, which we very much appreciate. So, let us set about opening a dialogue together, continuing the dialogue, but, above all, adopting a text that we have been waiting for for so long.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to point out that, while the Belgian Presidency was absent yesterday, it was because the Belgian Parliament was sworn in, and you are aware that parliaments have a pre-session. That is why, unfortunately, the Belgian Presidency was not in attendance yesterday.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, the Commission has, moreover, recently announced a comprehensive package of 20 other proposals in the area of financial services. Ladies and gentlemen, the Belgian Presidency will try, in close collaboration with you, with Parliament, to establish a road map to ensure that they are put into practice by the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, as we are aware, in October, the task force will be ready with its recommendations on the issue of strengthening budgetary discipline, the Stability and Growth Pact and economic governance. The recent euro crisis clearly demonstrated that monetary union without real economic coordination remains unstable. More than ever, the Union needs economic governance. The task force will therefore make recommendations for stricter monitoring, particularly in budgetary terms. This surveillance will not only concern the budgetary policies of our Member States, but also the economic parameters that make it possible to assess the credibility of tabled budgets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will then take all the necessary initiatives to implement these recommendations. The Council and Parliament should also tackle them without delay. That is a priority for the Belgian Presidency, and we will provide every support for these recommendations to be put into practice as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, as I have said, our first challenge is to restore sustainable economic growth. In the age of globalisation, we must step up our efforts so that Europe can once again have a competitive and innovative economy, and become a low-carbon economy. The way to get there is the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Belgian Presidency will support the flagship initiatives announced by the Commission. However, sustainable growth is not just a matter of economic parameters. It is also and, above all, a matter of human beings. It is decided by what it contributes in the greatest number. As can be seen in several countries, there is no sustainable growth, no real sustainable growth without social cohesion, which is Europe’s second major challenge and the second priority of our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why Belgium insisted, and achieved, in the EU 2020 programme, that the objective of combating poverty be expanded to the broader notion of social cohesion. Whether for this reason or for promoting economic growth, ladies and gentlemen, we must get Europe back to work, and we must increase employment rates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dwell for a moment on an issue that is close to my heart: that of our industrial base, the industrial base of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my view, what Europe is missing sometimes are common industrial projects, emblematic and inspirational projects, as, for example, Ariane, high-speed trains or Airbus were and still are.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not a matter of prestige and symbolism, but of real levers of our prosperity and of the creation of future jobs. Recently, I have been struck by economic analyses that showed that countries with a strong industrial base had weathered the crisis better than the more service-oriented economies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, our industrial fabric must be restructured. This does not necessarily mean that so-called traditional manufacturing sectors would be doomed either to relocating to countries with low levels of pay, or to disappearing. However, there are production methods that are.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By innovating, by manufacturing high-end products, with high added value, European countries can, even right now, successfully safeguard a high-performance, profitable industry with employees that are among the best paid in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, we Europeans have won the telecommunications revolution. On the other hand, we have been less successful in information technology. We certainly must not fail the green revolution, not only in terms of research, but also, and above all, in manufacturing green technology. Europe actually has excellent researchers. However, the United States and China, for example, outstrip us when it comes to turning the results of research into industrial production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The flagship initiative announced by the Commission in the area of industry will therefore be very eagerly awaited. Similarly, we attach the utmost importance to the December Council, which will be devoted to innovation in industry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under the heading of growth and innovation, there is also a specific issue that we hope to relaunch under our Presidency. That is the issue of the European patent, which we have already been awaiting for 30 years. We must think of our businesses, and SMEs in particular. Just think of the money and energy wasted by our businesses because there is no single procedure for the 27. Our operators are at a real disadvantage in the face of international competition. By relaunching this issue, the Council and the European Parliament have a wonderful opportunity to show their importance to citizens on practical issues. We must now move on from words to actions. The same applies, I believe, for the credibility of European innovation policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, the protection of the environment and of the climate is the third major challenge faced by Europe – the European Union – and, at the same time, is the third objective of our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="nl">No real sustainable economic growth is possible unless we protect our planet; a planet that does not belong to us but rather is on loan from our children. The European Union is the world leader in measures to protect the environment and combat greenhouse gases. It is the world leader in the objectives it sets itself for further reducing these greenhouse gas emissions. This pioneering role is not enough in itself, however, as the United Nations Climate Change conference in Copenhagen showed to our frustration. To be fair, the EU did not speak with one voice there and thus – to continue the football metaphor – sat on the bench while the play took place on the field.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, in the next few weeks and months, the EU must be much more active, precise and also assertive in the way it looks into the levers at its disposal to get other major players – and, at the same time, other major polluters – on board for an ambitious plan to protect our planet. This is the only way that the Cancún and Nagoya conferences will yield real results.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, as I have already mentioned, the EU is like those people who are said to have all the ingredients of a happy existence. Indeed, seen from the outside, the EU is a very attractive place, with its prosperity, system of solidarity and very human democratic forms of governance. Therefore – usually rightly – it attracts many people from all continents, people wanting to build a better life in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Indeed, the vast majority come here with good intentions, in search of ‘the modest miracle of a normal life’, as it was so beautifully put at a recent conference on Afghanistan. Such immigration has enriched our continent and will continue to do so. On the other hand, there are others at the present time who are abusing our systems of freedom. Organised crime networks are taking advantage of our openness. Terrorist organisations are abusing it for bloody attacks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, guaranteeing the security and freedom of our citizens is therefore the fourth major challenge faced by Europe. More than ever, the Union must become an area of justice, security and freedom. Therefore, we want to ensure that the Stockholm Programme, which was drawn up by the Swedish Presidency, is implemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">Belgium believes that developing a community policy in the areas of migration, asylum law and the prevention of terrorism is of great importance. With regard to cooperation in the field of criminal justice, our priority is the recognition of court judgments in the Member States. This includes a particular focus on establishing a European system for the collection of evidence.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the context of combating international terrorism, Belgium would like to come to a rapid agreement with the USA on SWIFT. This agreement should combine the protection of citizens’ data with effective measures to prevent terrorism. I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to reach an agreement here tomorrow. The Belgian Presidency will continue to build on the excellent work done by the Spanish Presidency in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">This brings me, last but certainly not least, to the fifth challenge confronting the Union: its role on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">The challenges there are huge and numerous: combating climate change; helping to preserve or restore peace; promoting the spread of open government; combating international terrorism; preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction; ending gross violations of human rights in areas of conflict, with special attention to violence against women; drawing up a coherent common energy policy; preserving and improving our market share.</p>
      <p sl="de">As already mentioned, the Copenhagen Summit painfully demonstrated that being the world’s largest trading bloc and being rich and attractive and a self-proclaimed role model of soft power does not buy us sufficient international bargaining power. The Union has to develop more leverage to bring others on board and create coalitions for the realisation of its objectives for peace, for sustainable development, for security and for free trade that is also fair.</p>
      <p sl="de">This requires, more than ever, that the Union speaks with one voice, and preferably with one mouth. The Lisbon Treaty provides the Union with new tools for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the next six months, the Union will start the establishment of a European diplomatic service. This is also one of the major challenges of our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have, indeed, to decide on the organisation and working of the External Action Service, and we have to adopt, with Parliament, the Financial and Staff Regulations of that service. Belgium will do everything possible for a smooth and successful start to this External Action Service, which will enhance the visibility and also the credibility of the European Union worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="de">Enlargement is another major element. The negotiations with candidate states have to be pursued vigorously, and all candidates must be judged solely on their own merits, in accordance with the renewed consensus of the European Council of December 2006.</p>
      <p sl="de">The negotiations with Croatia could enter their final phase under our Presidency. With Turkey, they will continue their course. With Iceland, they will start. For the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Presidency will endeavour to find an agreement for starting the accession negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our Belgian Presidency is, in fact, the first one which takes place entirely under the Lisbon Treaty. Belgium feels honour bound to exercise it with full respect for the letter and the spirit of the treaty, so as to create the right precedents.</p>
      <p sl="de">You are, of course, aware that elections have taken place in my country, that the negotiations on the formation of a new coalition will take some time, and that my government is a so-called caretaker government. I would like to assure you that this will not at all impair the vigour and enthusiasm of our Presidency. This 12th Presidency is supported by a large consensus in my country and by a long European tradition.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have in our political world in Belgium, at the federal as well as at the regional level, in our diplomatic corps and in our civil service, a large number of men and women with a profound knowledge of the European Union. Preparation has been very thorough, in close cooperation with the other Member States of the trio, and with the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, the government is supported by the European conviction of the population. The nine political parties taking part in Belgium in the federal and regional governments represent 90% of the population of the country. Belgium is one of the countries where the European idea and the project of European integration still command very large popular support.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last but not least, we have carefully and deliberately embedded our Presidency in the European agenda so as to set realistic goals and to promote them efficiently. I do not doubt our ability to conduct our Presidency efficiently, just as I do not doubt that the new government, when it is formed, will continue it smoothly and seamlessly.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I made clear, a rotating Presidency is part of an ongoing European process; it does not constitute an entirely new start. Still, every Presidency brings its own accents and the start is always an occasion to refocus the attention of the population on the importance of the European Union, on the importance of European ideals. The festivities which surround the start of our Presidency demonstrate the wide support for those ideals in my country. From the King and the Royal House to the concerts and dances in so many cities and villages, all communities and social classes took an enthusiastic part in celebrating the start of our 12th Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also want to express my sincere appreciation for the meetings I was able to have with colleagues in these last days, with you, with representatives of this Parliament. I found those meetings very instructive and constructive, and my government attaches the greatest importance to close cooperation with the elected representatives of the European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to address a last word to those populations whom you represent. I would like indeed to exhort them to believe in themselves, to have ambition for themselves, for their countries and for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our European Union must avoid two pitfalls: the pitfall of despondency and the pitfall of complacency. There is no reason for despondency. We should not fear the new competition in an increasingly multi-polar world. On the contrary, we should rejoice in it.</p>
      <p sl="de">For we ourselves helped to bring this new world about, for instance, by our efforts in favour of a more equitable distribution of resources and power. As has been said, what is happening now is not ‘the decline of the West’ but ‘the rise of the rest’. We must throw ourselves into this competition with zest and confidence – confidence in ourselves and in all the assets we have.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nor are there grounds for complacency. We can certainly be proud of great achievements in the past. We have systems of government which combine political and economic freedom with social solidarity and ecological responsibility. We offer many of our citizens a living standard which is amongst the highest in the world. But we cannot simply sit back and enjoy what we have. The rest of the world does not owe us a living. We have to work for it; we have to work even harder for it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not think that this Assembly needs convincing that, to get our Union and its Member States in higher gear, we need ‘more Europe’. This objective of ‘more Europe’ is at the core of the Belgians’ European and international policy. My country has always favoured the ‘méthode communautaire ’, the ‘Community method’, and continues to do so wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p sl="de">More Europe means, in the priorities and objectives of our Presidency: endowing the Union with a new financial regulatory structure; strengthening its economic governance; stimulating its return to sustainable growth; consolidating its social model; enhancing its capacity for innovation; developing its diplomatic service.</p>
      <p sl="de">I stand before you, the representatives of almost half a billion European citizens, to ask you for your cooperation and your support for those ambitions of our Presidency. The Treaty of Lisbon has, I am happy to say, strengthened the competences of the European Parliament and thus made it more than ever the driving force for European integration.</p>
      <p sl="de">My colleagues and I look forward to a fruitful cooperation between our Presidency and you all, Members of the European Parliament, in favour of the ambitions for Europe which we all share.</p>

    <intervention id="3-019" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, Belgium is taking on the rotating Presidency of the Council at a crucial time for the European Union, and I would like to thank Mr Leterme for setting out such a clear and ambitious programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The challenges of the months ahead are very clear. In particular, these challenges are to implement new coordination mechanisms for our economic policies, to stabilise the economic recovery by implementing the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth, and to ensure that Europe shoulders its responsibilities on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The June European Council supported the proposals presented by the Commission in its communication of 12 May on strengthening fiscal discipline and macro-economic surveillance, issues that have also been discussed within the task force chaired by Mr Van Rompuy. The task force’s final report will be presented by October.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the meantime, the Commission has stepped up its work to turn these guidelines into concrete proposals, more specifically in its communication of 30 June. This means strengthening macro-economic surveillance, including through the use of sanction and alert mechanisms, as well as the Stability and Growth Pact, by focusing, in particular, on the issue of the level of debt and deficits.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the European Semester will enable us to achieve more effective ex ante policy coordination. It is vital to finalise this as soon as possible, and Commissioner Rehn is sparing no efforts to submit the necessary legislative proposals without delay. I am counting on the Belgian Presidency, as well as on the European Parliament, to make progress with the work so that we have a new system in place by the end of 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Belgian Presidency must enable decisive progress to be made in implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. That requires each of the Member States to take ownership of this strategy and to integrate it into their various policies: finance, budget, employment, innovation, environment, energy, education and social policy. The key to achieving that is each Member State preparing its national reform programme in the coming months. All the institutions seeing this exercise through is a prerequisite for the success of the strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The various Community policies prepared through the collegial work of the Commission will support and build on the initial steps taken by each Member State. In that respect, the flagship initiatives that the Commission will present by the end of the year will be critical.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to talk to you about three of these initiatives in particular, namely, those focusing on employment and education, on innovation and on industrial policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue of employment is still highly topical, and I welcome the priority given to employment by the Belgian Presidency. In this context, the initiative entitled ‘An agenda for new skills and jobs’, prepared under the coordination of Commissioners Andor and Vassiliou, will strive to create favourable conditions for modernising the labour market with the aim of improving employment rates and to ensure the viability of our social models.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It takes growth to create jobs, and a large part of our future growth will have to come from innovation. The flagship initiative entitled ‘An Innovation Union’, coordinated by Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, will thus be one of the key issues of the Belgian Presidency. The main aim will be to facilitate the marketing of innovation, to identify a certain number of European partnerships for innovation in order to resolve society’s challenges in areas where the European Union can bring added value, as well as to improve the effectiveness of European, national and regional innovation systems. Above all, it is important to make progress on the issue of the Community patent in the coming months. The Commission has just presented a proposal on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the flagship initiative on ‘An industrial policy for the globalisation era’, the preparation of which is being coordinated by Vice-President Tajani, and which we will present in October, will aim to improve conditions for businesses, particularly SMEs, and to support the development of a strong and sustainable industrial base, capable of dealing with global competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to these flagship initiatives, I would like to mention two other projects of major importance. Following the publication of the report that I asked Mr Monti to prepare, the Commission will present an initiative on strengthening the internal market, including in view of the 20th anniversary of the internal market in 2012. We expect to present it under the Belgian Presidency. Commissioner Barnier is hard at work on it. Other contributions will come, such as, for example, those of Vice-President Reding and Commissioner Šemeta, to mention just two other colleagues. By its cross-cutting nature, the work on the internal market is at the heart of our collegial approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also emphasise the importance of considering the future of our trade policy, which Commissioner De Gucht is working on, and which will be presented in the autumn in the form of a communication. At the same time, it will be a matter of continuing our work on reforming the financial markets, in cooperation with our G20 partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards financial services, we have to continue along the road of reform. The Commission communication adopted on 2 June stresses that all the necessary measures will be proposed by spring 2011. The bulk of the work, however, will be done under the Belgian Presidency. The next six months will therefore be very busy, Mr Leterme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These measures are our response to the financial crisis, and we have presented them in a coordinated and coherent manner. I am counting on the Presidency to make as much progress as possible in the Council, and on Parliament to make this area an important priority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In direct connection with this European Union development strategy up to 2020, the Commission will, in September, present the budgetary review document. It is difficult to discuss policy without considering, at some point, the measures to be implemented for its application. This document, to which Commissioner Lewandowski and myself are paying particular attention will enable the European Parliament and the Member States to decide on the key principles for the next financial framework. The Commission welcomes the Belgian Presidency’s intention to assess it, in parallel with the work to draft the 2011 budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the importance, seriousness and urgency of these economic, social, financial and budgetary issues must not lead us to withdraw into ourselves. We have very important international responsibilities. The G20 summit in Seoul is a major meeting. That will be the time to check if the commitments undertaken by all the parties have been put into practice. In this regard, I hope to maintain European leadership. Consequently, the Commission will thoroughly embark upon preparing for this summit and we will do everything for Europe's voice to be heard clearly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of several important international meetings, such as the one on biodiversity in Nagoya, I would like to highlight the Copenhagen follow-up conference, which will take place in Cancún in December. We must make very practical progress in implementing the Copenhagen Accord while, at the same time, working with industrialised countries and with developing countries. That is what we are currently doing by means of the in-depth and increased contacts that the Commission is embarking on, particularly Commissioner Hedegaard, to prepare the ground with a view to a balanced and binding international agreement, which remains our main objective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should also redouble our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, as we said at the G8 summit. We must speak with a strong and united voice at the United Nations General Assembly in September, and at special events organised at the summit, on this occasion, to assess how we, the international community, are progressing towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I expect to represent the European Union there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The coherence of our external action will be strengthened by setting up the External Action Service. The commitment of the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Ashton, has enabled our three institutions to lay the foundations for a quick start, supported by a sound basis. It is now up to us to come to an agreement on the detailed texts that must be implemented as soon as possible and which we will discuss with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have therefore, ladies and gentlemen, a very full agenda in front of us, but with the determination and the community spirit that are driving and uniting this Belgian Presidency, the European Parliament and the Commission, I am certain Europe will be up to these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The history of European integration has proved that it is usually in times of crisis that Europe shows that it can face up to its problems and overcome them for the good of all our fellow citizens.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-020" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Presidents, the people of Europe would like a better understanding of how European decisions are taken, and they expect the European Union to give a concrete response to their concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, Yves Leterme, I would like to say here that it is also time to put an end to the long list of priorities of the rotating presidencies, which only result in disillusion. For years now, every six months, the Presidents of the Council have been coming here to explain to us that in six months’ time, they are going to rebuild Europe. Then they return six months later to tell us that, for reasons beyond their control, the expectations they have raised have come to nothing. I believe that this is the wrong way for the Council to behave and that it damages the credibility of our European project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that, firstly, because of its national political life and, secondly, because of the fact that the President of the European Council is also Belgian, the Belgian Presidency has not fallen into this trap and is concentrating its efforts on our three real priorities: growth and employment, the green economy, and security and freedom.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will say again here, and our fellow citizens are well aware of this: the response to all our major challenges, whether they be the economy, employment, security, the climate or energy, is first European and then global.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President of the Council, you have just said that Europe’s number one problem is its slow growth; in other words, the fact that, recently, it has not been sufficiently capable of creating wealth and employment. This is what your Presidency should focus on, and the 2020 agenda, if fully adopted and thus financed by the Member States – that is the key word, financing – may be a very effective tool for ensuring that Europe is both more competitive and greener.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, at the same time, we must make very real progress in the symbolic task of regulating the financial sector and reducing our deficits. Europe must set an example on this subject, and everyone must clearly see what it is that Europe is encouraging and promoting: not financial speculation, but work and entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also send a clear signal to Europeans on the issue of freedom, security and justice, as our fellow citizens often ask themselves why Europe still plays no part in areas such as the mutual recognition of court decisions. It is by offering specific answers to these types of question that our work will be better understood.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Leterme, you spoke well – I had prepared a conclusion, but I cannot read it out as it dealt with the Community method. Indeed, I am very much counting on the Belgian Presidency to ensure that, as you said, this Community method becomes an even more integral part of our various institutions.</p>

    <intervention id="3-021" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Leterme, you have presented an ambitious programme to us. I will begin where Mr Daul left off. All the items in the ambitious programme that you have described convey a clearly visible and tangible message. Belgium is a country which combines its Presidency with a commitment to an in-depth pro-European approach and this is the reason why this Presidency represents a significant opportunity for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I would first of all like to thank you, on behalf of my group, for ensuring that the Belgian Presidency, in the preparatory period and during the few days that it has been in office, has demonstrated that a government which is in power is very much able to lead the European Union provided that it commits to the basic European values. This is a positive and encouraging start to this Presidency.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Europe is in a state of social imbalance. The biggest problem facing all of us is the deep social divide within the Union. We are talking – and rightly so – about the financial and economic crisis of recent years. We are discussing the necessary measures which must now be taken in order to gain better control over the deregulated banking sector and, in particular, the deregulated speculation sector. Therefore, one of the decisive measures which must now be implemented is the package of regulations that we will be adopting tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">The banking supervisory package must be put in place during your Presidency. In the final vote on the first reading of this package, there will be a broad majority in favour in the European Parliament, which will give the Council the chance to come back to Parliament with a constructive proposal by the September part-session. This is your responsibility but it is also your big opportunity to help ensure that the social imbalance in Europe is reduced by introducing more regulations. The burdens and costs of this crisis must not be borne solely by the workers. The banking sector must be called to account.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">This is why regulation of the financial markets and economic governance are urgently needed in Europe. However, the Community method also applies in this case. I want to make it quite plain to the Council and to the President-in-Office of the Council that we have enough institutions in Europe. We do not need any more. What we need is for the institutions that we already have to take action at last in the interests of Europe. One thing is clear. We cannot say that we in Europe are unable to implement a financial transaction tax, for example, because the USA and China are not taking part in it in the context of the G20. Exactly the opposite is the case. If the capitalist sector in Europe is subjected to increased regulation, the United States of America will have no choice but to join in, given the speculation on the dollar which is just beginning. Therefore, we have the opportunity during your Presidency to make progress in this area in Europe and to set a good example to others.</p>
      <p sl="de">One measure which you have mentioned, Mr Leterme, is very important to my group. The African strategy which the Belgian Presidency has outlined seems to be a key issue for the European Union’s international policy, but not only from the perspective of solidarity. Africa is a forgotten continent and I very much support you and the Belgian Presidency when you say that Europe must focus more closely on it. However, we must also be aware that we are lagging behind, because other countries, primarily China, have already become involved in this continent. I will leave aside for the moment the question of whether the strategy which the People’s Republic of China is pursuing in Africa is one that we would regard as a fair partnership with the continent. As Europeans, our approach is quite different and is more accommodating towards the people of Africa. Therefore, we fully support the African strategy proposed by the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Mr President, I would like to make one comment on enlargement. It is true that we are now in an important enlargement phase, but, Mr Leterme, I will leave you with one thought. You have mentioned Turkey and I am one of the people who is in favour of Turkey joining the European Union. Therefore, I would like to say that if the Council does not clarify at some point whether it really wants Turkey to join or not, if we continue to act in an ambiguous way, saying time and time again that Turkey has a chance of joining and should become part of the EU, while, at the same time, knowing that there are at least four or five Heads of Government who are opposed to this behind closed doors, this is the best way of destroying the good relationship between the EU and Turkey, rather than bringing Turkey into the EU. Therefore, your job is to introduce some clarity into this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I very much liked your speech and I hope that the same goes for the other Members in my group.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, let me say straight away that the Belgian Presidency can count on the full support of the European Parliament and, in any case, of my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. The reason for this is quite simple. Belgian Presidencies have always endeavoured to advance and accelerate European integration, and that is exactly what we need for Europe at the present time. In tomorrow’s multipolar world, where the focus is on countries such as China, India and the United States of America, only a unified, integrated Europe will be able to play a role, and I am pleased that the Belgian Presidency will be keeping up the tradition of further advancing European integration.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The main thing we need from the Belgian Presidency, Prime Minister, is a commitment to the following. I believe I addressed more or less the same words to the Spanish Presidency six months ago. There is an urgent need for us to finish our homework on the economic and financial crisis. Europe has not yet done its homework. It is essentially a matter of five dossiers that need to be brought to a successful conclusion. The Belgian Presidency would actually be a tremendous success if these five dossiers were to be concluded, and as quickly as possible. First and foremost, the stress test for the banks must be completed and these banks recapitalised if necessary. There will be no economic growth and no resumption of lending until the banking sector is cleaned up.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened correctly; which, in very specific terms, means with the European Commission and the European Central Bank in the cockpit. It does not mean with the Member States in the cockpit. That is impossible; it would not work. Member States cannot monitor or penalise one another; only the Community institutions can do so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, we need genuine economic governance. That is the third task. Getting genuine economic governance off the ground for the euro area, again with the European Commission in the cockpit at all events, or in the driver’s seat, as we put it here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fourthly, there is an urgent need to put the finishing touches to the regulation of a number of financial products, including hedge funds. We are working on that dossier, but we have to take a decision on it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last but not least, as has already been said here, there is an urgent need to get European banking supervision under way. Let me be clear in that regard, Prime Minister: a number of Member States, indeed most of them, have yet to grasp the lesson of the crisis, which is that national supervisory authorities are not capable of performing that task. Not one of our national supervisory authorities in any of the 27 Member States ever sounded the alarm or switched on the flashing lights at the time of the crisis. Yet now, the Member States come and tell us in not so many words that it should be the national authorities that continue to perform that task. Let me tell you, Prime Minister; there will be no agreement with Parliament unless the European supervisory authorities have the last word. After all, that is what matters at the present time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">May I give you a piece of advice in this regard? I have only one piece of advice to give. We are not in the habit of doing that in Belgium. I was given a great deal of advice in the past, when you were in opposition, and I shall endeavour to give you some advice in return now that you are in the majority. In order to achieve an agreement on this European supervision, Prime Minister, it may be necessary to abandon unanimity in the Council. In my opinion, you should not attempt to persuade Parliament to change its position. On the contrary, it is the Council that should change its position; that is, should consider abandoning the quest for unanimity and endeavour to conclude an agreement with the European Parliament on the basis of a qualified majority.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, if I may, Mr President, I think there is one final point we should discuss with the Belgian Presidency, which is that, in addition to all the rhetoric about reorganisation – which is necessary, as reorganisation is the growth of the future – we need an economic growth strategy. I am thinking, in particular, of a pan-European infrastructure plan. The Commission needs to produce such a plan in order to complete the internal market to include the southern European and Central European countries. That, too, should form part of your programme.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to say that I am very pleased that you have made a clear statement here in favour of multilingualism. I see this also as a signal to the citizens of Belgium to place much greater value on multilingualism, which forms the foundation on which their country can develop in strength and in harmony. As a German, I can only say that when I was young, I envied my fellow pupils at school and other young people who grew up in multilingual countries and therefore had much better opportunities. Thank you for sending out this signal.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">You need this because, as head of the Belgian Government, you are used to dealing with dwindling forces of integration. This is both a Belgian and a European problem. Apart from the serious challenge posed by the financial supervisory system, I support everything said by the previous speaker. It is important that you succeed in working with us and with the Commission to restore the confidence of the citizens of Europe in the European Union’s ability to act. We have lost a great deal of their confidence. In the past, Europe was a bulwark against crises and uncertainty which offered freedom and also a constant improvement in living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The citizens of Europe no longer have confidence in us and I believe that, apart from stricter financial supervision, we must begin to tackle the challenges which are caused by the fact that in many other areas, European countries and their citizens are seeing things drifting apart and gaps widening.</p>
      <p sl="de">Much has been said about the different levels of competitiveness in the European Member States. We need to address this issue. It is right for Brussels to become involved in decisions on strategies relating to wage and tax policies. We do not want to take responsibility for everything, but the one-sided focus on budget policy practised by Germany, while it will bridge the gaps within the European Union to a certain extent in the short term, is certainly not enough.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to say that I believe that we must take much more action on social conditions. People in the donor countries are constantly reading in the newspapers that the Germans have to wait until the age of 67 before they can retire, while in other countries, people are taking their pensions before they even reach 60. That is not a basis for solidarity in the long term. We are facing a very wide variety of divides and challenges and I believe that we should not deceive ourselves about the seriousness of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that the Belgian Presidency will resolve one issue, which is the role of the permanent Council President, a position held at the moment by a Belgian, Mr Van Rompuy, and the rotating Council Presidency. Until now, we have been given the impression that the permanent Council President, one of your fellow citizens, is at risk of becoming simply the tool of Council interests and of acting as a scene-shifter for the large governments within the European Union. This is not right and things cannot go on like this …</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President. Mr Leterme, I have a very great deal of respect and esteem for you. You are rotating President and, at the same time, outgoing Prime Minister. You are actually without a mission, but will still have to retain your mission in Europe. You are a European missionary, as it were. May I give you a few pieces of advice? I am not going to use the standard bureaucratic language, but would point out that you are a West Fleming. You are hard working, persistent and thrifty; which I consider excellent qualities. Like many West Flemings, you also have a good measure of common sense. I have become rather more familiar with West Flemish politics in recent years. Yet I should like to protect you from the ‘Tower of Babel’ effect. You say more Europe, we need more, and so on. We must take care not to build a Tower of Babel, paying more attention to the colossus itself than to quality. The Stability and Growth Pact is one example of this. We have had a Stability and Growth Pact, which Mr Prodi described in 2002 as stupid and inflexible. ‘Stupid’ was the word he used; and then, of course, these things collapse.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The common thread in your programme is, in fact, money. First and foremost, we must look at the euro. Our worries are not at an end. Will Greece make it or not? Are we heading towards a situation of l’euro du beurre et l’euro des olives , if I may put it that way? That would be a bad thing. I am in favour of a healthy euro. If you are, too, you have the full support of the European Conservatives and Reformists. The solution is budgetary discipline, a smaller administration and more debt restructuring. The example of the United States has shown that large-scale bailout programmes do not help. Employment rates are not rising in that country.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is also about the budget. Indeed, I should like to ask you a question about this. You talk about more Europe, to which everyone in Belgium replies – and there is also a tradition of this in Belgian foreign policy – that this means more money. I am not so much in favour of that. The Commission frequently has to contend with under-execution as it is. Sometimes, it has money left over from the Structural Funds. In 2008, the Commission had to repay EUR 4.5 billion to Member States, and so 1% of GNP is enough.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, you should be wary of a European tax. In Germany, the atmosphere is explosive. Its people cannot pay for everything. Deutschland kann nicht immer zahlen. German politicians do not always dare to say this, so I am saying it for them. In Germany, the maxim is: Weltmeister ja, Zahlmeister nein, Mr Schulz. We shall see about the former on Sunday, but I agree with the latter. Therefore, we should not raise the subject of European taxes. You are doing so, and Mr Verhofstadt has always done so, although I have never been sure if he was speaking on his own behalf or that of his group. Mr Dehaene is also starting to discuss this again. This must be avoided, or the Tower of Babel will collapse.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Presidents, Mr Leterme, you are assuming this responsibility at a time when the people of Europe are suffering terribly as a result of an unprecedented economic and social crisis. The time has therefore come to be bold, to take new, progressive initiatives to ease their pain, and to exit the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You list a number of objectives, such as sustainable growth, the fight against poverty, and the environment, which we can share. Unfortunately, however, we predict that they will go unheeded, and, as I understood it, Mr Daul himself also had doubts about this, as the extreme austerity choices implemented in Europe contradict the stated objectives. There will not be any sustainable growth, recovery or fight against poverty if people’s purchasing power is not increased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To deal with this crisis, we must make a clear choice: that of justice and employment over the financial market; that of having a proactive policy aimed at human, sustainable and solidarity-based development. The fact is that the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact that you have just agreed with Mr Barroso places enormous pressure on workers, young people and retired people, and those States that do not implement it shall henceforth be threatened with sanctions, up to and including the withdrawal of their voting rights in the Council, which you preside over, and the withdrawal of certain aid funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Should farmers, workers who have been laid off, the retired and civil servants be the ones to pay for a crisis for which they are not at all responsible? Mr President, will you search for new solutions, such as the tax on capital flows, which is so often mentioned, or a European tax on capital and financial revenue?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We were somewhat hopeful that your Presidency would help to implement a new directive on services of general interest, but you have not spoken about this. As for SWIFT, this is not progress towards freedom; it is exactly the opposite. Instead of a stability pact that has become an austerity pact, would it not be better for Parliament, the Council and the Commission together to come up with a different solution: a new pact of social and ecological progress, backed by a European Central Bank with new tasks, to buy back the debt instruments of those States that need it and to refinance public credit at an interest rate, thus supporting employment, research, innovation and education, as well as a major European programme of useful and ecological infrastructure?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The International Confederation of Trade Unions has put forward another comprehensive, work-centred plan, aimed at combating speculation and encouraging fair taxation. The European Trade Union Confederation is calling for action on 29 September in Brussels. I believe that this is where our solution lies, Mr President, and I wish you every success in your Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="en">I was somewhat vilified a few months ago for pointing out that Belgium was not really a proper nation, but the electors of Belgium have rather proved the point: a separatist party is now the biggest party in Belgium! We have before us a caretaker Prime Minister, but we all turn a blind eye and pretend that it is business as usual. It simply is not!</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Leterme, you have no legitimacy here. What an extraordinary irony that a country that is on the verge of breaking into two is, for the next six months, telling 26 other Member States what they should be doing! Perhaps worse than that, of course, is your own sheer hypocrisy in this matter, in standing here this morning and being a ‘good Belgian’. Let us just remember that you yourself, as Belgian Prime Minister, did not even know your own national anthem. You famously said, back in 2006, that it was only beer and football that held the country together. Now, I suppose, with the trappings of power, that has all been forgotten!</p>
      <p sl="en">Really, everybody in this Chamber is in denial because Belgium is a huge embarrassment to them. It is a prototype.

I would not have thought there should be a Belgian Presidency of the Union. Would it not be fun if, at the end of the six-month Presidency, there was still no government in Belgium!</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, what we have just heard is somewhat reminiscent of the orchestra on the Titanic. The Presidency of the European Union is now being held by a country that is not even capable of governing itself. Never before has the rotating Presidency had to contend with an outgoing government from the outset, and indeed, it is far from certain that Belgium will obtain a new federal government within the six months of this Presidency. Following the previous elections, in 2007, it took nine months for a government to be formed. This is because the artificial Belgian model is ungovernable. Flanders and Wallonia have become two different countries, with two totally different political, social, economic and cultural realities. Forming a government for Belgium is a bit like Germany and Greece having to draw up a common budget. None other than European Commissioner Karel De Gucht recently called Belgian governmental operations a permanent diplomatic conference.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Besides, what is the democratic legitimacy of a Belgian Government that represents less than one in three voters in Flanders? If Mr Leterme is to be believed, things will turn out all right. The Belgian Government means to attempt to hide its lack of resolve and of democratic legitimacy behind a smoke screen of ultra-federalist rhetoric, then. Yet the uncomfortable reality is that Belgium is lagging far behind the European pack in terms of the transposition of European legislation. The same goes for the several ongoing infringement procedures. Added to that is the Belgian public debt of more than 100%, and an immigration and asylum policy that has become so out of hand that we really should be calling it an open-border policy. Then there is the sky-high tax burden and the very low employment rate, not to mention the democratic deficit that means that the Flemings, who make up the majority of the population, are regarded as a minority.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Besides, how can Mr Leterme be sure that he enjoys broad support among the population for his European programme if no referendum has ever been held, for example, on Turkey’s possible accession to the European Union? No referendum may be held on this, Mr Leterme, and so this Belgian Presidency would be well advised to adopt a low profile. Member States must beware of a failed state that is attempting to export its problems to Europe and is seeking to make Europe a larger version of Belgium. In any case, the European Union would do well to prepare for the disintegration of Belgium and the creation of two new states, two potential new Member States of the European Union: Flanders and Wallonia.</p>

    <intervention id="3-030" speaker_id="28256" name="Jean-Luc Dehaene" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to start by saying to Mr Claeys that Belgium has always solved its problems by means of political agreements and has always worked towards a stronger Europe and also stronger regions that are closer to the people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As you emphasised, Prime Minister, the Belgian Presidency is the first to fully implement the Treaty of Lisbon and set the course for future Council Presidencies with the interpretation of a new institutional agreement. The Presidency must concentrate on the operation of the Council, given that the European Council has become a separate institution with a permanent president. A new circumstance is that the treaty describes the Council’s powers in exactly the same terms as those of the European Parliament. The two institutions exercise the legislative and budgetary functions jointly. Thus, the treaty expressly establishes a bicameral system at Union level. Important exceptions notwithstanding, codecision – the ordinary legislative procedure – is now the general rule. I cannot shake off the impression that the Council is still insufficiently aware of this new circumstance. One illustration of this is the trialogue in preparation for the 2011 budget. The Belgian Presidency can play an important role in this process of raising awareness.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Council Presidency must function as the Presidency of a parliamentary assembly from now on. It must advance the legislation and the budget agenda of the Union on which the Commission takes the initiative by promoting consensus within the Council and agreements between the Council and Parliament. In the case of this Presidency, this clearly relates to definitive regulation of the financial institutions, a European External Action Service, the budget and the financial perspective. The Community method must be strengthened when regulating all of these. Only this can produce results.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Belgian Presidency must ensure that the EU actually speaks with one voice at the Climate Change conference in Cancún. The most efficient model is that of the World Trade Organisation, where the Commission speaks and negotiates on behalf of the Union. The Belgian Presidency should build a consensus on applying that model at the Climate Change conference, too. I believe in a strong, efficient Belgian Presidency, particularly given that a caretaker government can occupy itself with it virtually full time.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President. Mr Leterme, let me begin by wishing you every success with the launch of the Belgian Presidency. You have listened to a number of MEPs who have their doubts about this Presidency, saying that the fact that yours is an outgoing government will make this a weak Presidency. I do not believe that that is the case. This is evidenced by the guidelines you have set out, including today, in one of the most animated speeches I have yet heard from you. I am delighted that you have presented it here in this House. Therefore, I believe that this has the potential to be a strong Presidency and that you will preside over the European Union with due care and attention, especially because – and I am very proud of this – we are a country with a particularly pro-European mentality, as though it were in our genes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question is, however, will this be enough? You and many others have pointed out that the financial package is particularly important to us, but I would also urge you to lend strong support to a number of the top priorities of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, namely, the climate and social aspects. I shall single out the latter point, as it is particularly close to my heart. In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, I should like the Belgian Presidency to be able to present results in the field of poverty reduction. I hope that you are able to promote the idea of a European minimum income, among others, and are able to urge the Commission to take initiatives on that point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As you have heard, our large group will be supporting you with great verve, and will also be keeping a somewhat critical eye on you. Mr Leterme, I see a Presidency team with great passion, and that is to be welcomed. However, Europe also needs a leadership that can speak with authority and – I do not mean any offence by this – I, and many others, hope that a new Belgian Government will be sworn in before long to take up that torch.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I promised myself that I would not react to Mr Farage’s provocations, but I must all the same mention Talleyrand, that great man who thought that everything that was excessive should be despised. That being said, hello, Prime Minister, hello, Mr President, welcome to our Parliament, welcome to your Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Irrespective of whether it holds the Presidency of the Union, Belgium has always had great European and Community ambitions. The two go hand in hand almost unanimously here, as Mr Schulz and others have reminded us today. This was the case even in 2001, during our previous Presidency – the main architects of which, Guy Verhofstadt and Louis Michel, are, incidentally, in this Chamber – when we presided over the Laeken Declaration, when we presided over the Convention, which ultimately laid the foundations for the Treaty of Lisbon. This score was written back in December 2009, and it is now up to you, Mr Leterme, to interpret it as the conductor. Moreover, I would say that, in the last six months, this melody has hit the wrong note in some key areas. On this institutional point, the important thing for you is to fine-tune the melody so that this triumvirate can learn to work together better and to cooperate effectively with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly, Europe’s whole credibility rests on its being effective, and the example, the counterexample I should say – the most symbolic thing – was the wrong note hit in Copenhagen. It is no longer an option for 10 or almost 10 of us to go to Cancún. Europe needs one voice, one position and, this time, quantified objectives. This is another debate, I know, but it is essential, and, furthermore, you have brought it up.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Apart from that, the figures and the priorities have been imposed by the crisis: financial regulation, economic governance, a return to growth, which leads me to the debate on the financial perspective, the means for our action, for the recovery and for growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say, Mr Leterme – and I will conclude with this – that the Belgians are not waiting for the Commission’s proposal in order to show their ambition and firmness with regard to principles. Growth cannot be achieved through savings alone. It would be tragic, suicidal even, if the crisis were used as an excuse for turning off the tap still further.

      <p sl="fr">Mr Leterme, I hope that, by now, you will have understood that you have the opportunity of scoring a very early goal. I am, of course, talking about financial supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You will have noted that the overwhelming majority of this House is in favour of setting up a European watchdog for the financial markets, the players of which are also, by and large, European.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Until now, the Council’s position has, roughly speaking, been one of maintaining the status quo, as if nothing had happened since 2008. National self-interest appears to be the only thing that takes precedence over the model with which we here are unfortunately all too familiar, of …</p>
      <p sl="nl">… ‘wat wij zelf doen, doen we beter’ , meaning what we do ourselves, we do better.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want an operational agreement on 1 January 2011, then the Council will have to move strongly and quickly. If it means the Council voting by qualified majority, as Mr Verhofstadt was suggesting, then so be it. We did not adopt the Treaty of Lisbon to then immediately lapse back into the dictatorship of unanimity. Given the circumstances, we have the opportunity to have a full-time rotating Presidency, as has been said. You therefore have everything you need to prove the pessimists wrong and to make a success of this Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to raise two matters. The first concerns the cooperation of the Belgian authorities with the High Representative for Foreign Affairs in forming the European External Action Service. The next six months will be decisive for the structure of the service and the principles of its operation. Therefore, I would like to call the attention of Mr Leterme and the Belgian authorities to the necessity, when selecting staff, of ensuring a geographical representation which is just and as broad as possible, in accordance with the text of the Preamble and Article 6(6) of the document which will most probably be adopted by Parliament tomorrow. It is important that the External Action Service be European, and not a kind of elite club for the chosen few.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second matter I would like to raise is the strategic interest of the European Union to be found in the eastern dimension of foreign policy. It is a very disturbing fact that, apart from a short mention about continuing cooperation with the countries of the Eastern Partnership in the field of justice and external affairs, this aspect has, in large measure, been omitted from the Presidency’s priorities. Therefore, I appeal for good use to be made of the next six months in order to guarantee a European perspective for our eastern neighbours. I repeat that this is in the European Union’s strategic interest.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, aside from the President of the European Council, who nobody voted for, now we also have a Presidency-in-Office in the hands of a government that has lost the support of its own citizens. This should be enough to make us understand why Europe is going through a deep crisis: Europe has become a political paradox controlled by a political elite to which the citizens cannot relate.</p>
      <p sl="it">The programme of the Belgian non-Presidency speaks of structural reforms, increased employment, financial stability and competitiveness, and the instrument of choice is the EU 2020 strategy. However, the current crisis should be pushing Europe to choose ingredients that are very different from those that led to the collapse.</p>
      <p sl="it">A general rethink is needed because the crisis is not the reflection of the decline: it is the death certificate of the European social model that euro propaganda would like to administer as a cure instead.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe is currently a huge building that is crumbling in on itself under the weight of democracy, centralism and obstacles to free enterprise. If Europe is to emerge from the crisis, it needs to change its vocabulary: more decentralisation, less bureaucracy, more substance and attention to citizens’ real problems. Everything else will only inevitably accelerate the decline.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Leterme, the condolences have been flooding in for days now. It has been said that you have shot yourself in the foot, that you have started a Presidency with an outgoing government, that the Treaty of Lisbon has changed everything anyway, that the rotating presidencies no longer have a say in matters, and the latest thing we hear is: ‘Fortunately, you have Mr Van Rompuy’. My response to all these kind messages is: in the land of surrealism, of Magritte and the Smurfs, nothing is impossible. Mr Farage lacks imagination. There we go!</p>
      <p sl="fr">On a far more serious note, the work that has been carried out for months, Belgium’s federal structure and its regional governments will give this Presidency the solid foundation that it needs. There is no risk in that regard. As for its role as the rotating Presidency, it is ultimately a kind of subsidiarity. Let me explain: Belgium must add value to the work of the Council and of the High Representative. This is where it gets really funny, since I have heard Mr Van Rompuy talk time and again about reassuring the financial markets, yet I have never heard him talk about reassuring the citizens. The citizens are worried. They expect Europe to provide a common response to the crisis in terms of financial regulation, job creation and green growth, with projects, investments, means of support and, finally, a social dimension and a European dynamic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that Belgium’s solid social traditions and the noble vision that you have of cooperation and Africa will inspire the European institutions, as an alternative to sarsaparilla, which, Mr President, is the Smurfs’ favourite food.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, the circumstances surrounding the launch of the Presidency are not ideal but, at the same time, they represent an opportunity to focus on the real task of a Presidency under the new institutional rules. Yet I also see another opportunity in the form of helping steer the institutional debate, not only in our country, but also in other EU countries. As you know, the role of the nation states is increasingly under discussion as a result of globalisation. More powers are being conferred on Europe – and rightly so – as a result of which more powers can also be transferred to Flanders, Wallonia, Scotland, Catalonia and other regions. This is a natural process of which Europe takes good account. It is also quite logical for these nations to claim their place at the European table, given their important role in economic recovery. During this Presidency, regional ministers, too, will be presiding over Council configurations, such as environment, sport, education and regional policy, and I hope that this will give an impetus to the necessary, enhanced, multi-level governance of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Now, Mr Leterme, you know far better than I that Europe must now perform its historic duty; in other words, it must impose a Community approach on Europe’s national leaders in terms of common discipline, certainly, but also in terms of recovery and innovation. In this drama which is being played out before us, there is no longer any national way out of the global crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many European leaders – your colleagues – are watching the popularity ratings. At the moment, Europe’s leaders must look at history before history itself submerges us in the chaos of populism. Belgium is a country that was always strong on European patriotism; whether it is in a good or a bad state is immaterial. It is the will, discipline and objectivity of its leaders that will save us.</p>

We hope that the Belgian Presidency will bring architects. The first test, of course, will be this September, when the Council considers Parliament’s proposals on the financial structure.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet, one of the greatest challenges Europe currently faces is guaranteeing that the European currency does not collapse, whether for lack of monitoring instruments or for lack of growth in the euro area, or especially due to the growing differences and internal tensions from the economies which constitute the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Cutting the structural funds now, which were created in order to stimulate convergence in economies that are diverging from one another, as the Commission proposes, is like sending fire-fighters to fan a fire that has not yet been extinguished. We clearly need architects.</p>

The situation is urgent: there are 24 million unemployed, and there will be 5 million more if nothing is done about it. Unfortunately, Mr Leterme, Mr President, I did not hear any response in your proposals just now to this urgent situation ahead of us, and I would like to offer you three suggestions, which I believe will enable us to tackle the economic and social situation we are facing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, a large European loan. This is one possible way of achieving this policy of full employment. Secondly, we were with Jacques Delors and President Buzek in Brussels a few weeks ago to propose a major EU energy policy. Thirdly, the tax on financial transactions.

How can someone argue for the autonomy and independence of the Member States and then come to the European Parliament to discuss the internal policy of one Member State?

Even though, in the last few months, political priorities have focused on the numerous anti-crisis measures aimed at protecting employment, stimulating a recovery that is a long time coming, then stabilising the euro area, it must be said that we have reached a point in our common history that is undoubtedly fragile but, above all, crucial to our future. Forced as we are by circumstance, we have here an incredible opportunity: to dare to imagine solutions that were unimaginable only a few months ago, such as the famous concept of European economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time to develop a real strategy for exiting the crisis and to launch structural reforms to build the post-crisis society. We must be bold and develop concrete budgetary, wage and fiscal measures. We do not have 36 solutions: to ensure real cooperation and necessary efficiency, we need greater integration and unconditional support for the Community method.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Leterme, I would firstly like to say that I listened carefully to you and have also read your programme closely, and so I would like to begin with something that you told us here today when you introduced yourself. You said that a European Union with a monetary government, but without an economic government, would not work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I could not agree more, and that is why I am calling for clear, transparent and, above all, democratic measures for such economic governance, because these have not existed until now. They have not existed, and this reinforcement and the objectives presented are more along the lines of the Stability and Growth Pact, with greater emphasis on the deficit and public debt. We are also well aware that these are measures that, once again, will strengthen this monetary government, but not the economic government that is urgently needed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why this is the same as with measures to reduce wages, like those that have been implemented as part of stability and growth plans; competitiveness is impossible, and therefore to insist on it is to insist on recessionary measures that will only lead to greater recession.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also like to say that in relation to the new structures announced and the additional measures to continue the important initiatives devised in Europe over recent months, we have not seen much actually happening. Therefore, perhaps what has already been announced should be implemented, rather than announcing new things. Not only did they fail to be implemented; their effects were not felt, neither by us nor the Greeks. Moreover, I think it is essential that we should move forward in the spirit of social, economic, decent and transparent integration, once and for all.</p>

Prime Minister, it is logical that a number of Eurosceptics and Europopulists – let us call them that – are not happy about this, as they are terrified of Europe becoming stronger under this Belgian Presidency. Your priorities of a stronger economy, stronger economic cooperation and, in particular, an action plan for more jobs, are particularly welcome.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Prime Minister, allow me to add one point, and that concerns sport. As you know, the Treaty of Lisbon allows us to launch European sport campaigns. Sport is an excellent uniting factor, of which we are currently seeing evidence daily in South Africa. It is a uniting factor between regions, between countries and, particularly, between population groups, and I say let us seize upon the Council meeting on sport in November to set to work on this and put sport, too, on the European agenda.

A whole range of important priorities have been reviewed in the course of this debate. I should like to draw your attention to one very specific dossier that is crucial as regards the European transport sector, the further development of a sound European transport infrastructure and the achievement of our climate objectives, namely the Eurovignette Directive. This directive was dealt with at first reading back in March 2009 and has been stuck in the Council ever since. It is an important one, however, as we want to give Member States the opportunity of charging not only infrastructure costs but also external costs such as noise, air pollution and the costs of congestion to the lorries using our roads. This should result in greater efficiency in the sector, help reduce congestion, and also yield additional resources for Member States, which should be reinvested in transport systems in order to make these more sustainable and to contribute to economic growth.

      <p sl="it">Alas, this six-month term has not begun well: it started with a violent eruption that is unprecedented in the history of the European Union, with the detainment of Catholic bishops meeting at the Archbishopric of Mechelen. Documents submitted under confessional oath by citizens who had expressly requested to remain anonymous were confiscated, and two cardinals’ crypts were profaned by jackhammers inside a church.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Belgium is assuming leadership of the European Council for the 12th time, so it is, in theory, a country which is experienced in this role, although many in this Chamber are wondering how a country which, for five months, has not been able to appoint its own government and prime minister, will be able to lead the other 26 Member States. The next six months are going to be a particularly difficult period, for both Belgium and the other EU Member States. On the one hand, the responsibility of leadership is complicated by institutional changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon and, on the other, by the spectre of an enormous economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fighting the economic and financial crisis in Europe is identified by the Presidency as a priority. It also gives an important place to climate protection. Much is going to depend on having a pragmatic approach to implementing these intentions. Stimulating the development of a low-emission economy cannot be achieved at the expense of stifling industry in Central and Eastern Europe by the imposition of a drastic reduction in CO2 . This would prevent the whole of Europe being lifted out of the crisis effectively.

      <p sl="fr">Through this debate, the European Parliament has, in its plurality, I believe, expressed a very clear priority: the economic issue and the social issue. The various groups have emphasised this priority and have even recommended that the Belgian Presidency concentrate on it. I believe that it is, in fact, the primary concern of our fellow citizens. We can bring Europe closer to our fellow citizens by concentrating on what they feel is the biggest problem: currently in Europe, it is unemployment, the employment issue, those who do not have a job and those who are afraid of losing one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, this is why I am keen to tell the Belgian Presidency and Parliament once again that we are ready to work with you in a very focused, very intense way, to fulfil these obligations. This month, there will be an immediate economic priority: the publication of the stress tests. This is a major priority. It is a crucial exercise in transparency, but it can only succeed if it is well prepared by the national regulators and by the national governments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is of paramount importance. After this, there is the whole development of our economic agenda, the flagship initiatives that we have talked about: the employment initiative, the implementation of the 2020 strategy. We must, of course, reach conclusions on the economic governance of the euro area and of Europe as a whole, and on financial supervision too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament’s message has also been very clear on this point, and I must underline it. You know that it was on the basis of the proposals made by the Commission that a debate was subsequently held between Parliament and the Council. I see Parliament’s latest positions as an indication of its willingness to reach a compromise. I call upon the Council, in turn, to take a step in the direction of the European Parliament. I believe that the Belgian Presidency will be able to use all the mechanisms provided for in the treaty to reach a compromise, since I believe it is essential for the new supervisory architecture to be ready for the start of next year, so that we may fulfil our obligations not only to ourselves, but also to our main partners within the framework of the G20. We are the ones who started this process, and I would not like us to be the last ones to conclude it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is, in fact, a huge job to be done here, both economically and socially, and I am keen to reiterate once again that I have every confidence in the Belgian Presidency. This is not just because it is the second time that Belgium has held the Council Presidency. In short, if there is one country that has a natural affinity with Europe, that has a European instinct, a particular vocation for Europe, it is Belgium. I am not saying this out of politeness; I am saying it because it is true, but also because, quite apart from these traditions, I have confidence in this team. We have already had meetings at the Commission with the Belgian Presidency, and we have seen its extraordinary level of political and technical preparation and, above all, its dedication to, and passion for, the European cause, our common cause: a stronger, freer, more united Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="3-059" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Yves Leterme" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, to begin with, of course, I should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the Members of the European Parliament who have spoken – group members and others – for their words. I should also like to make clear that we feel rather encouraged in our approach to these six months. Without wanting to exaggerate, I have the feeling that, in the coming weeks and months, we can be partners in moving Europe forward which, I believe, is the crux of the matter. In any case, I know that there is confidence in the Belgian Presidency today, and I also know that we shall have to earn that confidence and to prove ourselves deserving of it. This is the frame of mind with which we are now starting out.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am sure you will forgive me for not responding to all your specific questions and speeches, for example, Mr Belet’s questions about sport and the questions about the Eurovignette. I know by heart that there are passages devoted to this in our substantial programme. This also goes for a number of speeches by other MEPs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Perhaps I should say something first and foremost about our approach, and some repetition may be necessary. As Mr Daul has already said, our ambition was not so much to make a catalogue of promises, both realistic and unrealistic. We have actively striven for what Mr Daul would call ‘moins de promesses, plus de résultats’ ; that is, fewer promises and more results. That is our ambition. Our intention was not to produce a Presidency of gimmicks involving the individual wishes of one Member State, which would also have overestimated the importance of the Presidency within the framework of the implementation of Lisbon. No, our ambitions are clear: to sign up to an agenda determined at world and European level rather than one dictated by Belgium. The agenda of this Presidency, too, is dictated by your institution and the European institutions in general, and also by current events.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I repeat once again that we subscribe to the approach of the Treaty of Lisbon – the Treaty of Lisbon as a whole, and nothing less than the treaty. As some Members have said, the Belgian Presidency is, in fact, the first to be able to establish precedents and apply this Treaty of Lisbon and all its provisions during its six-month term of office.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the aspect, for example, of pure bicameralism, as mentioned by Mr Dehaene, is an innovation that is sometimes still underestimated by colleagues – including colleagues in the Belgian Government – who are finding out about it today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It seems to me that one of the first tests at this level will be the preparation of the 2011 budget. As a former parliamentary official, I know that preparing a budget – I am going back 15 years here – is always a rather delicate task. Today, with the disappearance of the distinction between, on the one hand, compulsory expenditure and, on the other, non-compulsory expenditure, and with the prospect of pure codecision before us, this is an exercise that I feel demands our full attention, and I believe that Mr Wathelet, Secretary of State for the Budget, will be anxious to do a good job.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we want to move Europe forward, therefore. We want to do so with a great deal of respect for the institution that derives the most legitimacy from the people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When it comes to the content, I feel encouraged by many people’s words. As the President of the Commission, too, mentioned in his speech, it is clear that the restoration of sufficient sustainable economic growth – which must be fairly distributed, Mrs Van Brempt – must have absolute priority; and, Mr Verhofstadt, this can indeed be done by providing a solution as regards financial supervision. We have taken note of your request to consider having recourse to qualified majority voting. There is the problem of hedge funds. In addition, drawing on the stress tests and, particularly, the conclusions that will have to be drawn directly from these tests, we shall have to take the necessary measures to strengthen the balance sheets of our banks and ensure that the financial world is able to radiate financial strength once more. The next step must be to revive the real economy, and the European Commission has presented the relevant texts and plans. Mr Barroso, in that regard, I agree with those who expect, on the one hand, a strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact and stricter budgetary surveillance as a matter of course and, on the other, stimuli for infrastructures and for industrial policy, which would make Europe more tangible for social and economic players than is currently the case, and which should form part of a common ambition for our whole continent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, with regard to the social aspects, I should like to emphasise all the same that, although Europe does not really have very extensive competence in this area, Belgium’s ambition is to take full account of the consequences of the financial, economic and social crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The crisis started, just under two years ago, with an implosion of the US banks, and its consequences became evident on the continent of Europe. We therefore had to take swift action. The second effect impacted on the confidence of citizens as both consumers and investors. This lack of confidence, this loss of confidence, then had a negative impact on the real economy which, in turn, has had negative effects on the job market, the social consequences of which we are now having to contend with.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as a number of MEPs have said, people expect the EU to take action on this, as has been demonstrated repeatedly in the past. Indeed, this was the reason for its creation: as a kind of guarantee of the prosperity and welfare of the citizens of this continent. Therefore, the EU must provide the right answer to the negative social consequences we are experiencing as a result of the crisis, which started as a financial crisis and has ended up as a crisis of the real economy, and is also being seen on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to make one special remark in the light of the history we share with an important part of Africa; one special remark about the Africa strategy. This issue was raised by Mrs De Keyser and Mr Schulz, the Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the Union’s Africa strategy, which forms part of its external relationships, we support the discussion which Baroness Ashton has initiated with the aim of bringing greater coherence to our regional relationships. Of course, it is true that Belgium, because of its long tradition, wants to keep the African continent at the top of the European agenda and we also want to make as effective a contribution as possible to today’s discussion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as I have already said, I am not going to go into the specifics of every point. We have taken very careful note of everyone’s wishes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude, I would like to underline what Jean-Luc Dehaene has said, which is that one of the advantages of the current political situation in my country is that we can devote almost all our time to the EU rotating Presidency, including during the coming holiday period.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Besides that, I would like to underline and repeat that the programme of the Belgian Presidency was drafted after extensive dialogue and debate within Belgium, and these debates have also included all the regional governments. One specific characteristic of my country is that, both at the federal level and at the regional level, our governments are composed of numerous parties. I therefore repeat that the programme is supported by almost 90% of the representatives sworn in yesterday in the Belgian Parliament. Ninety per cent of the members of that Parliament support this Presidency programme.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As acting Prime Minister of Belgium, and as the acting rotating President, I would like to thank you. We will work very hard in the coming months. Yves Leterme has thanked you, and I can assure you that the Prime Minister of Belgium – whoever it will be – will be here again in December. I hope then that we will be in a position to see that our common ambitions have been reached.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Against the background of the current economic crisis, I welcome the decision made by the Belgian Presidency to make the implementation of long-term economic recovery measures a priority. In this respect, I believe that it is of paramount importance for the Belgian Presidency to achieve, by the end of this year, its objectives for setting up the new European financial supervisory authorities. They will help harmonise European regulations in the following sectors: banking, insurance and securities. On the foreign policy front, the Belgian Presidency must support the strengthening of the European Union’s ties with the countries in the Eastern Partnership. We must focus particular attention on the Republic of Moldova as this country, which would like to move closer to the European Union, has early parliamentary elections scheduled for November. I believe that the Asia-Europe Summit, which will be organised by Belgium in October, will play an important role in the development of relations between the European Union and countries from Asia. Furthermore, enlargement negotiations must continue, along with the process of setting up the European External Action Service.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The agreement reached between the various institutions envisages that the Service will be created by January 2011, even though it took more than seven months to negotiate its organisational structure. The actual and effective creation of the EEAS is now a matter of urgency, because the Treaty of Lisbon’s credibility is at stake, together with Europe’s image within the international community. Your experience of negotiating and reaching compromises will help in the actual implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. We wish you every success.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to welcome the priorities which the Belgian Presidency is proposing to us. I feel that they are fairly apt for the current times. In particular, two of these priorities caught my eye: the ‘intensive’ dialogue with Member States and the ‘ambitious’ policy providing access to employment, in other words, jobs. What I would like to ask you, on behalf of the Romanian citizens whom I represent, is for these Romanians to stop being treated as second-class citizens when we talk about the labour market and the Belgian labour market as well, unfortunately. Once these six months are over, we should no longer be able to talk about unfair and discriminatory access. It is my ambition to be able to thank and congratulate you for the removal of the barriers which, unfortunately, Belgium is not alone in still using. I firmly believe that you have the same ambition too.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I am delighted that having taken over the European Presidency, Belgium is determined to realise many goals on its agenda which are very important for the European Union as a whole. Belgium expects a stronger, more resolute Europe which would be oriented towards the implementation of the social model. Therefore, Europe must strive for a closer dialogue between the European Union and its citizens. Employment will be one of the main social goals during the Belgian Presidency. I agree that investment in human capital and job creation are inseparable social and economic development goals. It is especially important that Belgium will devote much attention during its Presidency to the creation of new jobs and will strive to provide more opportunities for the unemployed to return to the labour market. Youth unemployment also requires more attention. I therefore welcome measures which will promote learning and provide young people with opportunities to find work immediately after graduating. As this is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, I am pleased that Belgium will pursue further action in this area. I support Belgium’s determination to further strengthen the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and to combat violence against women.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Belgium is taking up the EU Presidency at a time when many of the consequences of the systematic crisis of capitalism are coming to a head. In the EU, this is, moreover, a crisis at the very foundations of the process of integration, as is becoming clear. The number of people within the EU who have been plunged into poverty has risen to more than 85 million. This is a figure which, according to measurement criteria proposed in recent weeks, may be even higher, surpassing 100 million. This is exacerbating the structural imbalances within the EU. Economic and social cohesion is increasingly becoming a mere slogan, a dead letter in treaties. The seriousness of the situation is in contrast with the total lack of measures to tackle it. Rather, when faced with the crisis, the EU’s prescription will inevitably entail an even sharper decline in the economic sphere and a more marked regression in the social sphere. This will happen with the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact and the resulting attacks on wages, social rights and the social functioning of the states, and with the deepening of the single market and liberalisation. In this framework, the intensification of the social struggle within the various countries is sure to blight the six months of the Belgian Presidency. This is a cause for hope and confidence in a better future!</p>

      <p sl="hu">Belgium took over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from Spain in difficult times. The European Union currently faces a number of tough decisions. In addition, a change in government is expected to take place soon in Belgium, the current Presidency holder. However, the interim government can build on the reliable and tested public and diplomatic service that has been preparing for the Presidency for some time now and can use the experience gained from the country’s numerous past presidencies. I consider it exemplary that there is national consensus over the Presidency’s programme in spite of the large number of disputes dividing the different language communities and political forces in Belgium. I believe that Belgium, as a member of the Trio Presidency, will act in the spirit of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian programme and I am confident that it will see through what it has undertaken. I welcome the fact that the Presidency is planning to implement a strong social programme in the next six months, and that it intends to monitor the social effects of the crisis continuously and make sure the issue stays on the Council’s agenda. I support the Presidency’s intention to organise a conference on the rights of people with disabilities and that it is urging European acceptance of the UN convention on these rights. It is also Belgium’s task to evaluate the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. I trust that in the next six months, the enlargement process will gain new momentum, that Croatia will move closer to the completion of accession negotiations, and that Western Balkan countries will receive positive messages.</p>

Furthermore, continuing the advancement of the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty is still a task ahead.

For one, on institutional issues, such as the creation of the European External Action Service, or the European Citizens’ Initiative, for which I am co-rapporteur in the European Parliament. I hope that we will be able to elaborate a regulation that makes this tool of direct democracy accessible, easy to use and safe against abuse, giving an opportunity for European citizens who want to participate in European decision making. Moreover, I am delighted to see that the Belgian Presidency has ideas concerning gender equality as well, as the Presidency programme mentions most of the themes that the Spanish Presidency tried to advance. However, I would have been even more delighted if the Belgian Presidency had been more ambitious, or if it had only named expressis verbis the European Protection Order in its programme. I consider this piece of legislation highly important, naturally besides the new gender equality strategy and the Women’s Rights Charter.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The second 6-month period of the 18-month Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency will be particularly important for Hungary. As a member of the Trio Presidency and as the upcoming Presidency, we are ready to continue the close cooperation experienced so far in order to help develop a European Union that is closer to its citizens and their concerns and which can respond rapidly and decisively to challenges. Allow me to highlight just a few of the tasks to be completed in the current six-month period. Firstly, I believe it is important to complete the EU budget review procedure before the end of the year in order to allow the debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework to begin during the Hungarian Presidency. Secondly, I think the debate on the financial supervision reform package must be concluded. It would be a significant loss of face for us all if the financial supervisory authorities were not established by 1 January. Thirdly, I am convinced that it is in the EU’s interest to complete accession negotiations with Croatia by the end of the year. I am certain that if there is a political will, this objective can be achieved. This is also necessary in order to ensure that the enlargement process remains credible. Finally, Romania and Bulgaria’s joining of the Schengen area is now being finalised. The freedom of movement within Europe is one of the most tangible achievements of the EU for its citizens. We should therefore help the implementation of this freedom in every possible way. I am confident that we will make significant progress in all of these areas during the Belgian Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="hu">There will be an extraordinary meeting of the Council during the Hungarian Presidency in 2011, with primarily energy policy issues on the agenda. However, it would be advisable even for the Belgian Presidency to take concrete measures to strengthen the common energy policy prior to this meeting. Measures are most urgently required in the area of investments. The strategic review presented by the European Commission earlier defined the main development guidelines correctly. Subsequent discussions on infrastructure should therefore focus on generating financial resources. This is particularly important in view of the imminent start of negotiations on the EU’s next seven-year budget. Basic energy infrastructure investments must be given a more significant role in the new long-term budget through the reform of the Trans-European Energy Network programmes. Another area of action should be the provision of more opportunities for new technologies affecting energy supply. Decentralised and sustainable energy production can only be given appropriate momentum by the harmonisation of laws at EU level. We are anticipating that the Commission's proposal establishing a new legal framework for intelligent energy networks facilitating two-way communication will have significant positive effects. Given that this is a new regulatory area, political conciliation must be started as early as during the Belgian Presidency. In addition to looking at the future, the Belgian Presidency should also monitor the implementation by the Member States of the huge amounts of legislation already adopted by the European Union. The implementation of the third energy package, or the gas supply regulation that is being finalised in these weeks, should not suffer any delay.</p>

I would like you to use the current readiness of Member States to make bold decisions, for example, concerning structural reforms, which will favour good and cohesive economic governance in Europe. However, I would like to draw attention to the necessity of including all Member States of the European Union in these efforts, and not only those which are part of the euro area. Only when we have the strength which comes from unity will we regain credibility in the eyes of the financial markets, which will bring about a reduction in the costs of servicing national debts, facilitate fiscal consolidation and strengthen economic growth.

      <p sl="hu">It is to be welcomed that the current Belgian Presidency is paying special attention to improving the situation of people with disabilities and, in particular, to monitoring the signing and ratification by Member States of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, I believe that the Council’s decision of 26 November 2009 already lays the foundation for the legal situation whereby the rules of the UN Convention are applicable to European institutions, including the European Council. This means that these rules will also serve as the norm for the work of the current Belgian Presidency. The fact that Member States are at different stages of initialling and ratifying the convention cannot, in my firm opinion, create any uncertainty for EU institutions as to the de facto effects of the convention: ratification by each Member State is not required at EU level, since the European Council – which includes Member States’ representatives and is supported by Parliament’s decision – has taken its decision in this respect. The reason I asked the competent committee to include this issue on the agenda was that the question I had asked two months ago in this respect remained unanswered, in spite of the excellent working relationship with our Spanish colleagues. I sincerely hope that an answer will be forthcoming during the Belgian Presidency. As a final note, I would like to wish our fellow Belgian Members much success and all the best in their efforts.</p>

The implementation of the new financial supervisory mechanism needs to be completed, the euro area needs to be stabilised and budgetary discipline restored.

      <p sl="de">After Spain, another country which has its hands full with internal issues and which will neglect its leadership role within Europe is taking on the Presidency. This fact is likely to suit the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon, as the treaty involves a reduction in the power of the rotating Council Presidency. In addition, the large states will make good use of the new weak leadership to promote their own interests over the heads of the smaller states. If Belgium wants to discuss the demographic factors and economic reasons behind immigration, we might as well simply open the floodgates to Europe now. Immigration policy must not be based on the needs of large companies for an army of cheap labour or on politically correct multicultural visions. Its focus must be on the legitimate interests of the historic peoples of Europe. In order to protect these people against unrestricted mass immigration from the third world, Europe needs a family friendly policy which will increase the birth rate. Europe also needs a consistent repatriation policy for the thousands of illegal immigrants currently living in the EU. Belgium’s interest in rapidly completing the accession negotiations with Croatia is to be welcomed. However, Belgium is making no commitment to stopping the negotiations with Turkey. Almost every day, Turkey provides proof of its lack of readiness to join the EU. It does not form part of Europe in geographical, cultural or historic terms.</p>

      <p sl="et">The programme of the Belgian Presidency of the European Union Council contains the intention to introduce a White Paper on the development of sustainable transport for 2010-2020. Five years ago, the European Commission put forward a plan unifying the priorities of trans-European networks, one of the thirty projects being Rail Baltica, which would link Helsinki to Warsaw, passing through the Baltic Sea capitals. In the interim report drawn up in 2008, it was found that, of the 1142 km long railway network, only 135 km had actually been completed, although there should only be a third of the line needing work this year. There was one worrying aspect of the report: the line running from Białystok to the Polish border, which was also problematic because of the difference in railway gauge used in the Baltic States and Central Europe. The Belgian Presidency plans to examine the policies and methods which are to be brought into use to create an integrated European transport network. I am concerned that up to this point, the Baltic States have been left out of the European railway network, and I hope that during the Belgian Presidency, the connection of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with Europe will be emphasised in terms of infrastructure too. I think it is important to put pressure on the Member States involved in the project to continue their work and to take serious approaches to the technical problems that have arisen, so that Rail Baltica can be ready by 2020 as planned.

On the other hand, the October summit on the new European strategy for innovation will be an opportunity for the national leaders to seek greater clarity on aspects such as funding innovation and the indicators that will be used to measure it. I can only insist that allocating more resources to this field, funding for which must be given especial attention in the outermost European regions, must be done alongside promoting closeness between universities and centres of research and the national business community. This is the only way that this commitment can be translated into real business opportunities and greater competitiveness for our companies in the context of industrial restructuring.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is clear that the Belgian Presidency will focus mainly on the recovery of the European economy, financial markets and public finances. At the same time, however, there is an urgent need to resolve many related issues. Member States are expecting some difficult decisions on the reform of social and pension systems. The same applies to state-funded health care. However, there is one thing we must not forget: only a dramatic strengthening of family policy and support for families with children can bring a long-term solution to these problems. I therefore support the attempt of the Belgian Presidency to strengthen social protection. It is women who are mothers that face the highest risk of poverty. More than at any other time, Europe today needs concrete results. In my opinion, the plans submitted today to the Members of the European Parliament by the Belgian Presidency will not remain a mere wish-list for a better tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity today to address a few words to the plenary sitting of the European Parliament on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union and to present to you our plans for the accession negotiations with Iceland, a country with which we have all become more familiar in recent months because of the volcano Eyjafjallajökull. My apologies to the interpreters for forcing them to pronounce this tongue twister.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, I should like to emphasise, as you have also pointed out in your most recent resolution on the enlargement strategy, that enlargement has been a success story for the EU and for Europe as a whole and that it has brought benefits to both long-standing and new Member States. The enlargement process will continue to contribute to peace, democracy and stability on the European continent. It gives the EU greater weight in the world and also yields concrete benefits for our citizens, amongst other things, in the form of greater prosperity, better prospects for economic growth and new opportunities for cooperation, for instance, as regards transport, energy and many other areas.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Building on the progress made by previous Presidencies and in line with the renewed consensus on enlargement, which is contained in the conclusions of the European Council of December 2006, and with the programme of the Council Presidency trio, the Belgian Presidency will continue with these activities. Perhaps I should point out that steering enlargement in the right direction is one of the five priority axes of the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Council of 17 June welcomed the Commission Opinion on Iceland’s application for membership of the European Union and the recommendation that accession negotiations with Iceland be opened. In the light of the renewed consensus on enlargement, the European Council has established that Iceland is compliant with the political criteria set in 1993 by the Copenhagen European Council and has decided that accession negotiations are to be opened.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Council has also requested that the Council set out a general negotiating framework and has also issued a reminder of the objective of the negotiations, namely that Iceland adopt the acquis in its entirety and ensure full implementation and enforcement thereof. This means that Iceland must comply with its existing obligations, such as those under the European Economic Area Agreement, which the supervisory authority of the European Free Trade Association has pointed out. In addition, Iceland needs to take action on the other weak areas to which the Commission referred in its Opinion, including financial services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Council has also welcomed Iceland’s intention to focus on these issues and is convinced that it will actively continue with its efforts to settle any outstanding issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the European Council has confirmed that, as in the case of all the other accession candidates, negotiations will be based on Iceland’s own particular merits, and that the rate of progress will depend on the progress that the country makes towards satisfying the criteria laid down during the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How are we going to proceed on this matter? We will apply the same procedure as the one we followed during previous accession processes, in line with the renewed consensus on enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council will first adopt a negotiating framework for Iceland, which will set out the general principles governing the negotiations and the conditions that it will have to satisfy. This negotiating framework will also take account of Iceland’s particular merits and its specific situation and characteristics. The fact that this country has recently benefited from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance will clearly help prepare it for accession.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Meanwhile, the Commission has already sent the Council the draft negotiating framework, and I hope that the General Affairs Council, which I will be chairing on 26 July, will be able to adopt it so as to pave the way for the first intergovernmental accession conference to be held with Iceland even before the end of this month.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If confirmed, this timetable would enable us to start accession negotiations before the summer recess. Iceland will then be subjected to screening by the Commission, which is intended to determine how prepared candidate countries are to commence negotiations in a number of specific areas of the acquis . These areas are subdivided, as you know, into chapters. In the autumn, the Commission will present its first regular report on Iceland’s progress towards accession. Based on the results of the screening conducted by the Commission and on a proposal which the Commission will submit to it, the Council will decide on the criteria to be applied for the purposes of opening and closing each chapter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some people are asking how long these accession negotiations with Iceland will last. Let us first emphasise the fact that, as a Member of the European Economic Area and of the Schengen Area, Iceland already has very close links with the EU and already complies with a large proportion of the acquis . However, it would be wrong for the Council to lay down a timetable for the negotiations or to anticipate what they will cover.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, in other fields, such as fishing for example – including whale hunting, an issue on which Europe has a clear position and which falls under the acquis , with which Iceland will also have to comply – and agriculture and rural development, negotiations will probably be a little more difficult. Enlargement is decided by merit rather than by an artificial timetable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I should like to emphasise that the Belgian Presidency is firmly committed to moving this process forward.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the enlargement process has so far been a success story, both for the European Union and for Europe as a continent. Therefore, the Belgian Presidency looks forward to cooperating with you on this in a positive and constructive manner in the course of the coming six months, not only on the matter of Iceland’s accession but also with regard to the other candidate Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to underline what my Prime Minister has just clearly stated in his presentation. The Belgian Presidency is particularly aware that the European Parliament has also played a crucial role, not least since the Treaty of Lisbon, in matters such as support for the enlargement process by ensuring, among other things, that the citizens of the European Union, too, continue to support this process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should also like to express my appreciation for the efforts made by the European Parliament and for your constructive contributions to the EU enlargement policy, for example, in the present resolution, when it comes to convincing public opinion and continuing to drum up sufficient support for the enlargement policy amongst all European citizens. Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="3-091" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Štefan Füle" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is my pleasure to be here with you today for an exchange of views on Iceland and the next steps in the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The unanimous decision of the Heads of State and Government to open accession negotiations, taken at the June European Council, is an important step forward in the country’s bid to join the European Union. It clearly confirms that Iceland has a place in the European Union and the common will of Member States to welcome it as soon as all conditions are met. The Commission warmly welcomes this decision, which follows the recommendations of our opinion of February.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me seize this opportunity to thank the House for its support in this process and congratulate the rapporteur, the honourable Member Preda, for his timely and high</p>
      <p sl="en">quality report. The European Parliament resolution under discussion today is a very helpful contribution to the process. It delivers the right messages to Iceland at the right moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure the House of the Commission’s full support for this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the political backing of Member States, the Commission is now actively preparing the next stages of the accession process. As a first step, the Commission prepared a draft negotiating framework, rightly admitted by my predecessor, which is currently under discussion in the Council. The Belgian Presidency foresees adoption by the General Affairs Council on 26 July, with a view to convening the first intergovernmental conference with Iceland on 27 July. We count on the Member States’ support in this endeavour.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiating framework lays down the general guidelines for the conduct of accession negotiations and points out reforms Iceland must undertake in order to join the European Union. As with all candidates, negotiations will be based on the country’s own merits and their pace will depend on Iceland’s progress in meeting the requirements set out in the negotiating framework. This includes the fulfilment of Iceland’s obligations under the European Economic Area. The Commission will provide Iceland with all necessary technical support to facilitate the process of negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, we are actively preparing for the assessment of Iceland’s compliance with the acquis, on a chapter by chapter basis, through the so-called screening exercise. That screening is expected to start in autumn 2010 and should last until mid-2011. In line with the renewed consensus on enlargement, screening of chapters with special sensitivity in the Icelandic context – meaning financial services, fisheries, agriculture and the environment – should start very early in the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout the whole process, the Commission aims to support Iceland’s efforts to meet the accession criteria through financial assistance under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). We therefore welcome the entry into force next week of the amended IPA Regulation, which allows Iceland to benefit from EU assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Parliament for its constant support in the process of adopting this important regulation. As a sign of it now belonging fully to the enlargement family, Iceland will, for the first time, be included in our annual enlargement package this year, with the first progress report to be published mid-November, whereby progress over the last year will be monitored.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you can see, all preparations are well on track to allow for an early start to the negotiations. Iceland’s membership of the EEA, its association with the Schengen Agreement, and the country’s high democratic standards will be valuable assets in this process. However, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that the road to accession will also hold a number of challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are well aware that issues such as whaling and fisheries – to quote the most obvious – are sensitive issues for both Iceland and the Member States. I heard your call for a constructive attitude when negotiating the fisheries chapters, and can assure you that the Commission will conduct talks in the best spirit.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the Icesave issues, I understand the concerns raised due to the slowdown in bilateral talks following the negative outcome of the referendum in Iceland in March. As referred to in your resolution, we hope that clarification of the legal situation provided by a letter of formal notice from the EFTA Surveillance Authority will facilitate the process of swiftly finding a satisfactory agreement between Iceland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recent exchanges at ministerial level give reason for hope. Let me stress that I greatly appreciate the efforts and commitment of all parties involved to trying to find an agreement on this issue. The Commission will closely follow the developments in the framework of the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not least, I share your concerns on the challenges stemming from the absence of national consensus and the related low level of public support in Iceland for membership. I have duly noted the call made on the Commission to provide support to the Icelandic authorities in its communication strategy on European Union membership.</p>
      <p sl="en">Communication will be a clear priority for IPA support to Iceland. We are working on the setting up of an information centre in the country, and on the development of factual and objective communication material. Our delegation in Reykjavik, which will be fully operational by autumn, will be instrumental in addressing the citizens of Iceland. It will work in very close cooperation with the Icelandic Government, which bears the first responsibility in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, let me reiterate the Commission’s full support for Iceland’s aspiration to join the European Union. I am confident that Iceland will continue to undertake all necessary efforts to ensure a positive outcome of the accession negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have emphasised on previous occasions, I will make sure that Parliament is kept fully informed throughout the negotiating process.</p>

    <intervention id="3-092" speaker_id="96838" name="Cristian Dan Preda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="ro">I would like to begin by welcoming the presence of the Commission and Council in the Chamber, as well as the fruitful cooperation we have had so far with these two institutions and also with fellow Members in the other political groups. The report which I have compiled deals with Iceland’s application to join the EU from the perspective of four basic factors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Factor one: political criteria. Iceland excels in this respect, with a strong tradition of democracy. On the other hand, in spite of recent encouraging signs, there are still doubts hanging over the independence of the judicial system. Furthermore, the Icelandic authorities need to end the distinction among European citizens when it comes to the right to vote and participating in local elections.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Factor two: economic criteria. As a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland already fulfils a large proportion of a Member State’s obligations. I welcome the resumption of bilateral negotiations on the ‘Icesave’ legislation, as well as the recent signs of economic consolidation. I obviously support Iceland’s desire to join the euro area after it becomes an EU Member State and fulfils the necessary conditions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Factor three: regional cooperation. On this point, Iceland and its accession offer the European Union a unique opportunity to strengthen and consolidate its presence in the Arctic region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last, but not least is public opinion. The role of public opinion is vital to ensuring that the accession process culminates in success. With this in mind, I believe that encouragement must be given to the Icelandic authorities’ initiative to launch a public debate and consult with all the stakeholders in this project. This is all the more important as a recent survey highlighted that Icelanders would like to receive more information about the EU and its policies.</p>

    <intervention id="3-093" speaker_id="96864" name="David-Maria Sassoli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, members of the Council and of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the start of accession negotiations with Iceland represents another step forward in the European integration process. We are talking about a country which has signed European partnership agreements for years, which has been a signatory to the Schengen Agreement since 1996, and which is one of the founding members of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="it">So far, Iceland has demonstrated that it meets many of the accession criteria, though there are some aspects that still need to be improved. I refer to the judicial system, mentioned by Mr Preda: it is important for Iceland to adopt clear mechanisms in order to ensure the independence of the judiciary and to resolve the problem of appointments of judges, prosecutors and supreme judicial authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Icelandic Government must work harder: it is the Icelandic people who must be convinced about wanting to participate in the European challenge. There are, of course, some issues that still need to be defined, and one of those is whaling. The conference in Agadir on 25 June confirmed the moratorium on whaling, and Iceland must act in accordance with this decision and stop whaling even for scientific purposes, since it is often a cover for commercial whaling.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, there is one point on which I think greater conviction is needed by Parliament and that is the Icesave issue, which has highlighted the need for a solid law on conflicts of interest in that country. Madam President, the negotiation stage can begin in order to reaffirm that Europe is not a geographical area or a closed system, and that, if they so desire and if they conform, the countries neighbouring Europe can participate in the development and the construction of the European project.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Iceland is one of the oldest democracies in Europe. The Althing, the Icelandic Parliament, is the oldest parliament on our continent. Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area, of Schengen and of Dublin, and that means that Iceland has already transposed most of the acquis communautaire . The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore strongly welcomes the commencement of accession negotiations with Iceland. As a member of the European Union, Iceland will be able to make a real contribution to Europe. However, that also means, Madam President, that Iceland must comply with its obligations stemming from Icesave; that is, its obligations towards the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. You know that the agreements with both of these countries were rejected in a referendum, and that means that the Icelandic Government must now make every effort in order to forge new arrangements with the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and to comply with them. After all, the basis of European integration is the saying pacta sunt servanda; that is, agreements must be adhered to. Should the Icelandic Government do that, then that will slot into place the final piece of the jigsaw of the accession negotiations with Iceland and of its accession to the European Union. These are the conditions under which we welcome the accession negotiations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-095" speaker_id="97136" name="Indrek Tarand" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a document here which defines the European Parliament’s mandate for negotiators with Iceland, and this is also an important message to the public, including the Icelandic public, which, as we know, is not optimistically minded in relation to integration with the European Union. As this constitutes a mandate, I think that we should stress those aspects which promise to be the most serious in their discussions, such as fishing and the question of whaling. I find it unfortunate that in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the proposals of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance were voted down, because they would have given a fair and candid message to the Icelanders.</p>
      <p sl="et">Indeed, however, the points which do not relate directly to the negotiators’ mandate were not voted down, and naturally I have in mind here the Icesave question. Fortunately, Mr Preda has achieved a satisfactory compromise here. To me personally, it seems unfair that some people would like to make all the Icelandic people responsible for the wrong decisions of economic actors. Furthermore, money was put into Icelandic banks by some British local governments, money which British taxpayers had given them in order to sort out public transport and education, not to spend in a casino.</p>
      <p sl="et">In one session of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Iceland was called a bankrupt island. It is true that Iceland was struck by a financial crisis, but can we think of many countries which were not affected? I cannot. I would remind you that in 1971, Denmark, too, was in very serious financial difficulties, but a year later, it emerged from that to become a very good European Union member. Finally, Madam President, I very much hope that, as early as this plenary session, there will be six extra seats in this chamber for Icelandic members.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the ECR Group supports enlargement of the Union and, in principle, of course we support the accession of Iceland – if that is what the people of Iceland themselves want.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are several reasons why Iceland’s membership would be good for the EU. First, the more the EU increases its size, hopefully the looser and more flexible the Union will become.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, Iceland’s dependence on its fishing industry will most likely result in a favourable deal which itself may prompt long overdue reform of the common fisheries policy and pave the way for Norway’s eventual accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, Iceland has already adopted large chunks of the acquis through membership of the European Economic Area and the Schengen zone, so absorption of Iceland would not exacerbate the so-called ‘enlargement fatigue’ that has been blamed for the public’s disenchantment with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">No one expects wealthy Icelanders to leave their underpopulated country en masse to seek work elsewhere in the European Union, as might be the case, for example, if Turkey were to join in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the decision rests with the people of Iceland in a referendum. In the last referendum held in Iceland, voters decided against refunding British savers billions of pounds following the collapse of the Icesave bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remain confident that Iceland will recognise and honour its EEA legal obligations in this regard to other most affected Member States such as my own country – the United Kingdom – and the Netherlands.</p>

    <intervention id="3-097" speaker_id="37676" name="Søren Bo Søndergaard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="da">Madam President, in the debate on Iceland’s membership of the EU, I have not actually seen any self-critical analysis. In my view, the debate should not only be about those areas in which Iceland has to adapt itself to the EU. We must not turn ourselves into a propaganda machine for the fact that Iceland’s membership has been, is and always will be clearly advantageous for Iceland.</p>
      <p sl="da">We must be in a position to assess the advantages and disadvantages in an objective manner. The people of Iceland are not stupid. They understand very well that if Iceland had been a member, the current fisheries policy in the EU would have spelled disaster for the fisheries industry, which is the country’s main industry. The people of Iceland also know that the EU’s repeated calls for the liberalisation of the banking system did not help to prevent, but rather to create, the basis for the bank crisis that they experienced in Iceland. Finally, the Icelandic people can see very well that, if they currently had the euro in Iceland, it would be much more difficult for them to get themselves out of the crisis, which, fortunately, Iceland is well on the way to doing on the basis of their own floating currency.</p>
      <p sl="da">The most recent opinion poll in Iceland indicates a steadily growing opposition to EU membership. If there was a referendum today, 70% of Icelandic people would vote ‘no’ and only 30% would vote ‘yes’. If we believe that this result can be changed by a propaganda campaign about the blessings of the EU, we are badly mistaken! Iceland’s application should not only be a reason to place demands on Iceland; it should also be a reason to take a self-critical look at the EU’s own policy.</p>

My recommendation to you is this: do not do this to yourselves. You are a lot more valuable as part of Europe, but outside the European Union. Norway, Switzerland and Iceland enjoy an intelligent, prosperous existence in Europe outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We in Finland have 15 years’ experience of this, and I am not at all satisfied. The influence that a small country has here is non-existent: the big countries dominate. You have much that is good in your country, and you certainly meet the criteria. You are a strong Nordic democracy, in which referendums do not make a mockery of democracy. When Norway said no in 1994, they did not vote again. When Sweden said no to giving up the krona, they did not vote again. Elsewhere in Europe, however, they vote again a year later if the result is not the right one. Do not do this to yourselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the defining feature of the EU conspiracy, apart from endemic waste and fraud, is that it rides roughshod over the wishes of real people. The push to bully Iceland into surrendering to EU rule is an example. Gallup polls reveal that 60% of Icelanders want to retain their freedom by staying out of the EU. Only 26% are now fooled by the pro-Union propaganda of the corporate media.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is no surprise. Icelanders have the oldest tradition of true democracy in the world. They do not want to exchange it for rule by unelected commissars. Icelanders have some of the last great fish stocks in the world. They want to preserve them from being destroyed, as EU membership has destroyed Britain’s fish stocks. Icelanders are proud of their Viking origins, vibrant culture and identity. EU rule would doom Reykjavik to becoming a scale model of the Muslim ghettos of ‘Londonistan’, Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen! So, from the belly of the Euro beast, I urge the people of Iceland: stay free! Say ‘no’ to European Union!</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Füle, Mr Vanackere, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Iceland’s accession to the European Union, because, as a member of the European Economic Area, it already fulfils many of the necessary conditions. It is one of the best functioning democracies I know of and I believe that the European Union will be happy to act as a safe haven for Iceland, which is the reason behind Iceland’s application. However, we should also make it clear that it is in our interest for Iceland to become a member of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, there is a whole series of questions which are not covered by the European Economic Area. Whaling is definitely one of the items that needs mentioning, together with a range of other issues relating to free movement of capital and agriculture, among other things, which need to be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe it is particularly important to ensure that the Icelandic Government enlists popular support for the accession. Negotiating in the full knowledge that the government does not have the majority of the population behind it will tie up resources in an unacceptable way. Therefore, Mr Füle, I would like you to make this clear, so that we are not negotiating to no purpose.</p>

    <intervention id="3-101" speaker_id="2173" name="Arlene McCarthy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is no doubt that Iceland’s home is in the European Union and it may come as a surprise to Nick Griffin that Iceland already voluntarily applies two thirds of EU laws, voluntarily is a member of the internal market and voluntarily is in the Schengen zone.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I want to stress today is that we need to develop responses to the financial crisis. It has been a dominant feature of our European policy making process. Commissioner, as you know, today, Parliament will vote on the financial supervisory package and on capital requirements for institutions and rules for bankers’ pay and remuneration. It is therefore important, in the wake of Iceland’s banking collapse, that we strengthen our partnership around financial reform. I am pleased therefore that this forms a key part – and indeed an early part – of the negotiations with Iceland.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is of course – as many colleagues have said – one major outstanding issue that needs to be resolved. The Icesave negotiations between the UK, Netherlands and Iceland need to find a fair and equitable solution to the compensation paid to savers and indeed, in my own constituency, to a cancer care charity which lost funds that had been donated to them and had to be compensated by our government. I am therefore pleased that the Commission and Council recognise the importance of this solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Iceland is uniquely placed to proceed quickly with negotiations and it has already adopted, as others have said, a significant part of the Community acquis due to its membership of the EEA. Over 35 different aspects of EU policy are to be concluded, including the areas of competition policy, financial services, agriculture, fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Chair of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the EEA Joint Parliamentary Committee, I strongly believe that, aside from the political negotiations that will now commence, it is of equal importance to further improve the political and civil society dialogue between the European Union and Iceland. By tradition, access negotiations are an open-ended process, with progress dependent on the good faith of both parties. This is why, for example, it is important that Icesave issues remain a bilateral affair.</p>
      <p sl="en">My simple recommendation to the Icelandic people, who may be apprehensive at this stage, is to await the final outcome before taking fixed positions. There is no question of bullying Iceland, as Arlene McCarthy has said. The Icelandic people are an intelligent people and they will decide, after the negotiations are complete, where their future is.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, as a Dutch national, I obviously think it absolutely vital we come to an agreement with Iceland about the debts incurred by Icesave, but on no account should that debate be an obstacle to opening negotiations now. Therefore, I very much value the constructive position which my Dutch fellow Members in the European Parliament have adopted on this issue. Ultimately, Iceland’s admission to the European Union will, in itself, act as our guarantee that it will eventually repay that money.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I shall now turn to a second aspect, that of whaling. Europe has placed whales on the list of protected species. European countries do not hunt whales. If Iceland wants to become a member of the EU – and I hope that it does – then it will have to stop whaling, and I think that it is this Parliament’s job to send out that message. However, let us not get into an argument about whaling now, when the negotiations have only just begun.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Iceland’s application for accession to the EU makes sense and deserves our support. Unlike Turkey, the country is situated in Europe, and it has long-standing socio-economic, cultural and ideological similarities with Europe. That, too, distinguishes it from Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Iceland’s accession is being allowed because that country is compliant with the Copenhagen criteria, but its dispute with the Netherlands and the United Kingdom over the Icesave savings is an even more important matter. That must be resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. Negotiations on the financial chapters of the accession agreement should only be closed once we have full agreement that Iceland will pay that money back and once we have clarity on this matter. For me, that should be a firm requirement. No hard cash, no accession.</p>

Because they were not part of this club, because they did not surrender to the euro, they have had a competitive devaluation of the krona, which has been good for their economy. It has led to a tourist boom and I would have thought countries like Greece would be very jealous of them.</p>

One is that you have a fundamental human right under modern human rights law to be informed correctly, precisely and accurately about public affairs – not just the positive sides but also the negative sides of accession. Moreover, those of you who want to mobilise against accession have just the same right to freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly as those who mobilise for the accession.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, when negotiating accession, it is important that you do not give the candidate country false expectations and that you also identify very difficult issues. In the process, you also have to be objective, and we know that the criteria also have to be met. Madam President, it is, for that reason, essential that Iceland comply with all the obligations arising from the acquis . Like the European Commission, I have come to the conclusion that Iceland is not exercising sufficient supervision of its financial markets. I have also concluded that its failure to implement the deposit guarantee system has led to problems with at least two Member States: the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Another thing that is part and parcel of a country’s acceding to the EU is that it has to comply with its obligations and reach agreement.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to point out that Iceland has already been cooperating with the European Union for a number of years as part of the European Economic Area since 1994 and of the Schengen area since 1996. As a result, this country will manage to implement European legislation fairly quickly.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that Iceland’s accession is of strategic importance in terms of strengthening the EU’s role in the Arctic Region and North Atlantic. At the same time, Iceland would guarantee its stability, while the European Union would include a country which, although currently in a crisis, has a market economy and democratic system.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Iceland is a small island country, one of the oldest democracies in Europe, with one of the most robust economies in the world. It recently found itself in the eye of the storm of the international financial and monetary crisis. It saw its biggest banks collapse and watched its national currency slump, resulting in an increase in unemployment and the number of companies going bankrupt, as well as high interest rates.</p>
      <p sl="el">As such, there is a direct and urgent need today to organise the financial supervision system and deposit guarantee system. The fact that Iceland has ambitions to accede to the European Union sends a message of confidence to the European construct.</p>
      <p sl="el">Its accession will clearly be easier than Turkey’s, because Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area, is a fully democratic country, and has adopted most European legislation. Its participation in the European Union will raise the European Union’s profile in the Arctic and open up a new chapter of two-way communication on fisheries and whaling issues.</p>

      <p sl="en">We have to recognise that Iceland has an excellent record in marine conservation – much better than that of many Member States. I could live with an arrangement that allowed whaling solely to meet indigenous needs, although the evidence is that Icelanders themselves do not seem to like whale very much.

      <p sl="en">The message has to go out loud and clear that there are no guarantees of prosperity. It is a two-way street. To paraphrase the words of the late US President, John F. Kennedy, we should say to Member States and applicant countries: ‘Ask not what the EU can do for you, but what you can do for the EU’. There is no gold mine out here that people can dip their hands into and become prosperous.</p>

Paragraph 26, which I will vote against, ‘encourages Iceland to adopt fisheries policy measures that will allow it to make the transition towards introduction of the CFP’. Surely not the current CFP? Surely Icelanders will not volunteer to join a common fisheries policy that has failed us, just as it would fail them?</p>
      <p sl="en">By contrast, paragraph 25 recognises Iceland’s ‘responsible and sustainable’ attitude to fisheries and calls for constructive negotiations on fisheries ‘so that the outcome may be a mutually satisfactory solution based on best practices and protecting the interest of both fishermen and consumers in the EU, as well as in Iceland’.</p>
      <p sl="en">On that point, which I do support, I think there is a need for urgent discussions with Iceland on the issue of the mackerel fishery, which I think the Commissioner will be aware of.

      <p sl="en">At this stage, it is worth highlighting the continuing predicament brought upon thousands of UK citizens following the failure of several Icelandic banks. These problems, in particular, the Icesave dispute, must be resolved before Iceland’s accession is agreed. There is, of course, another reason why we have to be cautious of Iceland’s accession to the EU. Iceland is understandably protective of its fishing industry. As fish is the country’s primary export and main foreign currency earner, Iceland hails the positives of its fisheries management policy, compared to the negatives of the EU’s failed fisheries policy. However, from the perspective of northern EU pelagic fishermen, free access to our waters is exactly what Iceland hopes to win from ongoing fisheries negotiations. The threat to the sustainable and well-managed mackerel stock in EU and UK waters that could come from Icelandic fishermen is very real. Ongoing negotiations with Iceland represent an ideal opportunity to dissuade Iceland from fishing mackerel at an unsustainable level. In the clamber to expand membership of the EU club, the interests of European and UK savers and our fishermen cannot be ignored.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Poland is very far from Iceland, but there are at least two reasons why we support Iceland’s efforts to join the EU. Firstly, we ourselves acceded to the Union not long ago, and we all remember clearly how very important that was for us. The EU must not be an exclusive club, and should be open to the membership of other countries. The second reason is the fact that around 30 000 Poles are working in Iceland – mainly in the fish processing industry. In relation to this, I have several comments: I am glad the process of negotiations on enlargement of the EU to include Iceland is at an advanced stage, and that on 17 June, the European Council decided to open negotiations with Iceland. It is also important that Iceland accept the universal character of the principles which govern the negotiation process. Accelerating the negotiation path for Iceland’s accession would be seen as a bad signal, particularly by the countries of the Western Balkans. One important issue concerns the readiness of Iceland’s citizens to settle questions related to the payment of compensation to the governments of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands for losses incurred by those countries as a result of the Icesave bankruptcy. However, I am of the opinion that bipartite disputes should not influence the process of a possible accession.</p>

However, the Council took only part of these elements into consideration at first reading.</p>

We care about the health of Europeans, and we cannot allow food produced from cloned animals or from animals bred from clones to be found on the shelves of our shops. European agriculture maintains high standards and is able to supply healthy products of the best quality, produced under conditions which do not threaten the environment. There is, therefore, no need to give up eating food which we are sure about in favour of untested, uncertain experiments.</p>

This is an essential requirement for proper and effective legislative activity, precisely because it is for the protection of human health.</p>
      <p sl="it">The measure that we adopted today, in line with the Council’s position, therefore proposes that all products with certain innovative characteristics be included on a special list so as to make people aware of the absence of products derived from techniques or technologies that involve genetic modification of provisions, especially those imported from third countries outside the single market.

The rapid development of science and technology has created the prerequisites for particularly advanced and innovative food manufacturing processes and measures.

The development of science and technology is unavoidable and essential in today’s world but, at the same time, it must be safe and dispel doubts over negative consequences on human health. Therefore, extremely strict rules on control and access to the market must be applied to food produce manufactured in this way and consumers must receive necessary and relevant information about it and have the right to choose.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Parliament’s position is to prohibit the use of cloned animals as a food source, and this is very important, because cloned animals that have been produced for purposes of research have exhibited completely unexpected muscular degeneration, deformities and rapid ageing of cells, and the animals in question have lived for only a very short time. We do not know about all the changes to cells that can be caused by nanotechnology.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For that reason, we must have the same sort of comprehensive clinical trials for these novel foods that already exist for new medicines, for example.

I feel we must distinguish between scientific research and practical use quite clearly, specifically in this case – the use of such foods in our everyday lives. A large proportion of EU citizens are against the appearance of cloned meat in the food market. Therefore, we must take this into account. Firstly, there would be doubts over the quality of such meat and its impact on human health has not been investigated conclusively. Ethical considerations and the ethical aspect are another important matter.

It is very important that we ensure that all consumers have uncontaminated foods available to them and that the market should not, as it were, drive the behaviour of consumers in this way.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We have to remember that there is still no precise data from research into the meat of cloned animals, and that is also true of nanotechnology. On the contrary, there are suggestions that the effects on health are not just positive. It is claimed that changes to the menu have also partially resulted in food borne illnesses.

      <p sl="pl">An additional point to which the rapporteur draws our attention is the need to avoid further administrative complications by failing to introduce market instruments which will help achieve the aims of the directive.

Protecting the environment we live in is fundamental for ensuring its maximum liveability for future generations. Protection of the air, ground and waters today requires a control and containment strategy for pollution-causing emissions to be developed at every institutional level in order to reduce the environmental damage inflicted throughout the 20th century.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we must not adopt too rigid a stance against industries which have a negative impact on global pollution and which, in these times of serious economic and financial crisis, would be liable to pay high or barely sustainable adaptation costs.

      <p sl="it">Precisely in order to have an integrated approach to these important areas, the directive in question was specifically aimed at facilitating the implementation of the best available techniques for controlling emissions, with harmonised EU standards for the authorisation of industrial facilities being developed in order to protect the environment, which is frequently threatened and compromised by industrial emissions. However, it does all this while also taking account of the need, which is shared by our industries, to maintain the competitive edge that is necessary to overcome the challenges of the future.</p>
      <p sl="it">A significant political commitment and intense and patient mediatory action were required on this issue. Thanks to this action, we have finally been able to reach agreement at the third trialogue. For these reasons, I would like to express my support for this report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Nowadays, environmental pollution can no longer be broken down by individual environmental elements. It now requires an integrated approach. This is why the European Union adopted the IPPC Directive covering 52 000 facilities. These businesses are responsible for the large majority of total pollutant emissions. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that while industry is one of the most important elements of the economy, it is also one of its most polluting sectors. The IPPC Directive is specifically designed to control the emissions of industrial and agricultural businesses. However, I believe that an efficient regulatory framework requires the integration of separate legal instruments. This is the only way we can create the best techniques for our Member States to draw up the most appropriate reference documents. I also support the idea that minimum requirements should be defined to enable appropriate control of emissions. This is why I voted for the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, alongside the fundamental environmental roles played by forests, as they are the most stable of ecosystems and form an integral part of the scenery of our planet, they are also important both culturally and socially, particularly in rural areas. The European Union must act decisively to eliminate illegal deforestation. This will protect competitiveness in the EU timber market and help control advancing climate change while, at the same time, protecting biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us not forget, either, the threats posed by natural disasters in deforested areas.

This ban is urgently needed as a result of the dramatic consequences of illegal logging. However, it was important to find a reasonable compromise which would not burden wood processing companies with unnecessary regulations. I am pleased that we have succeeded in preventing the introduction of superfluous rules and, at the same time, have effectively dealt with the ongoing problem of the destruction of the forests. In addition, we have removed an unfair competitive advantage caused by the import of cheap, illegal timber. The companies which use wood from legal and sustainable sources will benefit from this.</p>

Its implementation will leave a lot to be desired, however, and I wanted to mention that.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The illegal harvesting of timber is an obvious bugbear for legal operators in the forest industry, and it must be eliminated. Countermeasures, however, need to be considered carefully, so as not to hamper the operations of those that follow the rules. We have to remember that most of the wood used in the EU comes legally from within the EU itself. The problems lie outside. It will therefore be frustrating if we design such stringent monitoring systems for ourselves that we weaken the competitiveness of the industry in the EU without being able to tackle the problem itself at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The ban on placing illegally harvested wood on our markets sounds good but, in practice, it will puzzle actors in the industry. The requirements regarding traceability were formerly taken care of in the accounts, where the companies in the chain knew what they were buying and from whom, and to whom they were selling the goods. Now that these requirements are to be extended to cover the entire chain of operations, it will seem as if we are trying to act from within, even though the problem is rife elsewhere. Again, the EU will be tormenting itself, whereas it should be trying to improve the world.</p>

Obviously we need universal rules, but I do not think that this sort of stringent regulation with regard to bonuses, for example, should become legislation at European level: it should be dealt with nationally and is, ultimately, for the banks to decide.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, our parliamentary group voted today against the motion on the decisions taken on 9 May to create a European Financial Stability Facility and a European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, despite the fact that we consider these decisions to be extremely positive and important for the protection of the single currency and the stabilisation of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to take this opportunity to remind the House that the European Parliament asked the European Council to move in this direction a very long time ago, thereby sending a message of unity and solidarity to the markets. However, at the same time, we believe that the European Central Bank demonstrated the same willingness and solidarity in its decision on temporary intervention in the secondary bond market, a decision which was fully in keeping with the more general spirit of the decision by the Council of Ministers of Finance.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Madam President. The financial stabilisation mechanisms being proposed, albeit belatedly, will nevertheless provide important relief for those countries that are undergoing financial difficulties. However, we should be aware that these are only temporary measures. The crisis was a catalyst that demonstrated that there were significant and deep-seated problems inherent in the economic policies of many Member States, especially euro area states, and also that coordination of these policies poses a considerable problem. Let us by all means discuss the idea of a European Currency Fund, but before establishing such a new institution, we must perfect the existing institutions by improving the way that they work. We should concentrate chiefly on consolidating the European Union budget and on cohesion. We should definitely avoid a situation in which a series of support mechanisms takes care of the economic stability and positive credit ratings of the euro area states while the remaining Member States, mine included, are abandoned to the instability of the international markets alone.

Not for the first time, the European Parliament is exhibiting an optimism that makes Doctor Pangloss sound like Cassandra. I have been visiting Iceland since 1992. I have been a regular, and appreciative, visitor. I have seen a country transformed in those years. Of course, it has been through hard times recently, but nobody can deny the magnitude of an achievement which has taken a people, in two generations, from subsistence farming and fishing to enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am a democrat and I will respect the decision of the Icelandic people one way or the other. If they vote to join the EU, I will, of course, back their claim.

However, to avoid a disorganised approach and to institute equal competition conditions between the different Member States, we need a European initiative. I therefore fully support this initiative. In fact, it is vital that from now on, we avoid an excessive increase in risks at the level of each company and, in particular, that we avoid a general worsening of the systematic risk. As is underlined in the report, the decision to run these kinds of risks rests with the Boards of Directors and CEOs of these companies as well as the employees who work for them. In order to keep control of bonuses for traders and directors of European banks, the report plans for traders, in future, to receive a maximum of 60% of their variable remuneration immediately and a substantial part (at least 40%) after a period of at least three years so as to take account of long-term risks.</p>

Inappropriate remuneration structures of financial institutions played a big role in the accumulation of risks that led to the current financial, economic and social crisis.

Repetition of such practices led to the development of business models based on risk, in detriment to the sustained growth of companies.

However, and faced with an ever greater regulatory trend by the EU in these matters, I am reminded of what happened with genetically modified (GM) cereals, banned at the time from entry into the Union, but freely imported from third countries. This leaves European producers at a disadvantage when their products compete on supermarket shelves with others, generically identical, but with faster or cheaper production methods, enabling them to be more appealing to the consumer. Lastly, I would like to call attention to the fact that the United States Food and Drug Administration has already approved the consumption of cloned animals for food (2008).

Whenever a new foodstuff may have an effect on the human body comparable to that of a medicine, the Commission will request that the European Medicines Agency shall decide whether this foodstuff is covered by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. I am in favour of the exclusion of foods produced from cloned animals and their progeny from the regulation’s area of application. Indeed, I see no justification for the consumption of cloned animals, as I am not convinced that cloning does not put the welfare of the animal at risk.</p>

The document also urges the Commission to submit a legislative proposal banning foods derived from cloned animals and their descendants from being put on the EU market, similar to that which other texts, such as that of the resolution of 3 September 2008, have done. This is a correct and appropriate application of the cautionary principle.</p>

They die in agony within the first few months of life. In addition, experience shows that the reproductive methods used to produce animals will ultimately be used on humans. Therefore, it is important to send out a clear signal that we in the EU are opposed to cloning. It is also right to oppose the labelling of food made from animals which have been fed on genetically modified organisms. The majority of farm animals in Europe are fed on imported, genetically modified proteins. However, the genetic modification of forage plants does not transfer to animal products and is not present in meat, eggs or milk. The European Parliament has already spoken out in favour of excluding animal products from the labelling requirement in the regulation concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified food and feed products, which came into force in 2004.

      <p sl="pt">In 2005, the Commission initiated a review of the Integrated Pollution, Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, which resulted in a draft directive on industrial emissions. This seeks to revise and merge into a single directive the seven existing directives which deal with this matter. The IPPC Directive covers approximately 52 000 industrial plants, whose emissions represent a large proportion of the total air pollution in the EU. Under this directive, the relevant authorities of the Member States should take into account the Best Available Techniques reference documents when granting operating permits to industrial plants and when setting the emission limit values for certain plants.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Besides polluting the atmosphere, industrial activity also has a negative environmental impact on water and soil, and it produces waste.

It includes the important principle that if we are to protect the environment and public health, we must implement the best technologies that scientific and technological advances can provide us with in our production processes, especially those which have a greater environmental impact. However, the compromise reached at the second reading ensures the necessary flexibility when implementing the best available technologies, so as to take sufficient account of the differences between Member States and the circumstances of each one, both at the level of their respective production systems and conditions, and at the level of their capacity to implement the necessary adaptations to the technology and their production processes.</p>

I applaud the fact that the principle of subsidiarity has been applied in many of the provisions of the directive, resulting in a reduction in the number of powers delegated to the European Commission. I also consider it a success of the proposal that certain countries failed to push through a tougher proposal which would have gone beyond the framework suggested by the Commission itself. I consider all of this to be a victory for common sense. However, I have a serious concern that the creation of transitional national plans will not give enough space to the operators of individual facilities to prepare properly for the introduction of the new limits. It is right that we are trying to achieve a reduction in harmful emissions but we must, at the same time, bear in mind the economic effects of these measures and how rational they are in terms of the competitiveness and specific features of actual Member State economies. The fact that some facilities will be forcibly shut down in the middle of their operational life will undoubtedly have an impact on end-user energy prices, and will also affect the metallurgical industry, with potentially fatal economic consequences in some regions. Personally, I would therefore appreciate it if the directive gave more flexibility to the transitional national plans, with the cut-off year not in 2020, or 2023 for the closure of facilities, but in 2025. Despite being aware of how difficult it was to achieve this compromise, I am abstaining from the vote, with an eye to the competitiveness of the Czech economy.</p>

The new regulation, adopted by 644 votes to 25 with 16 abstentions, prohibits the sale within the EU of timber originating from illegal logging and products manufactured therefrom.</p>
      <p sl="es">Currently, it is calculated that 20% of wood products sold within the EU originate from illegal sources. To date, there has not been an explicit ban on the sale of this raw material within the EU, and so it has been possible for timber originating from illegal logging to be sold legally on the European market.</p>

Illegal timber coming from third countries also competes unfairly with the EU forestry industry which, more often than not, is producing timber legally and in a sustainable manner.

The dispute over the form of financial supervision concerns the extent of the powers given to the newly established European institution supervising the operations of the banks, insurance companies and financial markets. We must proceed with cool heads in our justified efforts to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis, and not give in to hysteria. The European financial market institutions should properly complement the national ones, rather than elbowing them off the playing field. The problems of a bank, insurance company or investment fund should always be resolved by the supervisory authority which is closest to the situation and which can therefore assess and evaluate it most sensitively. In many cases, this is not and will not be a European regulator. In my opinion, it is essential to have a national government veto over decisions of the European regulators, in order to prevent the seductive but dangerous application of a uniform procedure in a disaster situation which might vary across the financial markets of the Member States.

Drop the demand that they directly supervise individual financial institutions and let them confine themselves to cross-border problems.

In fact, the acceptance of a supervisory system based on the efforts of national authorities is completely inadequate, as their jurisdiction ends at their borders, while market actors are financial institutions whose actions take place over the borderless European area.

      <p sl="fr">Firstly, it should be noted that the lack of equity capital in the banking system was a key factor in the crisis, hence the importance of increasing it. I therefore voted for this report. Indeed, the latter is firmly opposed to the notion of the privatisation of profits and the nationalisation of losses, or their carry-over to society as a whole. The current system, particularly remuneration policy within the banking system, favours a high-risk approach. Indeed, excessive bonuses have led to the short-term search for profit, at the cost of the medium- and long-term stability of the financial system. This report judiciously explains, for example, that remuneration must be based on incentive systems and not on guarantees given to employees regardless of profits and losses made. Furthermore, it rightly seeks to establish a remuneration committee within the enterprise in order to improve transparency and information and also defend long-term interests.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome these measures two years after the financial crisis started, during which time the bonus culture has had serious adverse consequences on the global economy, with every taxpayer in Europe now having to pay. The banking system could be quick to accuse the European Union of interfering in its own policies. However, all the EU is doing is protecting taxpayers at a time when the banking system has taken care of its own interests on many occasions, ignoring those of the consumers. Changing the thinking behind awarding bonuses in the banking system, based on an assessment of banks’ long-term rather than short-term earnings, will partially protect Europe from economic shocks.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, every banking institution must behave responsibly and accept that there must be an appropriate correlation between fixed pay and the value of bonuses.</p>

The current global crisis has revealed weaknesses in the banking system and called its credibility with the public and businesses into question, in addition to the negative impact on Europe’s productive and industrial capacity and on the financial stability of the Member States themselves. At the root of the financial crisis was excessive exposure to risks brought on by banking operating rules, based on huge incentives for immediate results. These became increasingly unsustainable due to the lack of capital and the unregulated use of resources. In view of this, it is imperative to apply sound and ethically reasonable methods at the level of remuneration and incentives in the banking sector, so as to prevent the implementation of policies that encourage excessive risk-taking, coupled with the imposition of stricter requirements on capital for the trading book and resecuritisations.</p>

That is the reason why we voted as we did, as a protest against this double-standard policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">One other concern: stipulating new, stricter rules is all well and good. However, will this be enough to place finance once more at the service of the economy? Nothing is less certain. Banks rushed to repay State aid without meeting their credit obligations to businesses and private individuals, so as to be able to pay exceptional bonuses.

Banks must be subject to the 100% capitalisation requirement; they would then only be able to lend what they have.

This means that, two years after the global financial crisis, these new rules will transform the bonus culture and put an end to incentives that lead banking executives to take excessive risks.

At a time like this in which the warning signs of this crisis were given by financial scandals and its causes were found in the fantasy land of financial engineering to the detriment of investors and their savings, I cannot but support Mrs Ferreira’s report. The report with recommendations to the Commission on cross-border crisis management in the banking sector responds not only to the need to protect consumers and their savings, but also to the need to guarantee a single framework of harmonised rules, the uniform application of European law, a common culture of supervision and a coordinated response to crisis situations.</p>

These should be in accordance with the recommendations set out in the Annex, taking into account the initiatives taken by international bodies such as the G20 and the International Monetary Fund, so as to ensure equal operating conditions worldwide, and based on a thorough analysis of all available options, including an impact assessment. I believe that the mechanisms for financial sector supervision that currently exist within the EU and at international level have proven ineffective in the prevention or sufficient containment of the effect of contagion. The participation of shareholders and then creditors is essential in the redistribution of costs in order to minimise the costs borne by taxpayers as a result of crises in financial institutions and markets.

The creation of a risk assessment panel and criteria for such evaluation must be well defined before the event and with the necessary caution. This is the only way to ensure that there will be no additional occurrence of risk for any institutions that start going through hard times.

The motion for a European Parliament resolution with recommendations to the Commission on cross-border crisis management in the banking sector is a set of minimum demands. In addition, it is the voice of reason, and the European Commission should listen to it carefully. Public institutions must not wash their hands of the situation which exists in the banking sector. They look after the interests of EU citizens who use banking services.

Too much of the burden of the crisis fell on taxpayers’ shoulders. All of this would have been avoidable had there been the necessary international crisis management rules in the banking sector. Current EU and international financial sector oversight mechanisms were ineffective in trying to stop the crisis or stemming it sufficiently. We are all in the same boat – we must take robust measures in order to create preventive procedures and safety nets which would ensure the sustainability and stability of the financial system. This attempt should cover at least three things: firstly, an effective EU surveillance structure, linked to the European Systemic Risk Board; secondly, the creation of a strict EU code of conduct in the areas of management, suitable expertise and financial resources, so that EU crisis management procedures which support interventions are effective; and thirdly, an essential measure to standardise business conditions throughout the EU.

They form part of the package of measures by the EU and the bourgeois governments for stricter reform of the Stability Pact, so as to ensure that the anti-grassroots storm of capitalist restructurings needed by capital safeguard uniform, stable and inflexible application by the political powers of capital in all the Member States. The capitalist crisis and the anti-grassroots attack being unleashed by capital on the workers throughout the EU demonstrate all the more clearly the nature and character of the EU.

      <p sl="fr">Iceland, with its strong democratic and parliamentary tradition, has nothing to gain from acceding to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a member of the Delegation for relations with Iceland, I am voting in the interests of that country; in other words, I am voting against this resolution and against its accession.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, the country’s entire fishing and agricultural tradition, essential for its economy and a symbol of its identity, is at risk of being sacrificed on the altar of the CAP and the common fisheries policy. As a people who have always been anxious to preserve their independence and sovereignty, Icelanders are in danger of falling out of the frying pan into the fire when the EU imposes its ‘acquis communautair e’ and its accession conditions on the island, which has already been severely rocked by the financial crisis.</p>

I believe that the European Union can admit this country with an exemplary record of respect for the rule of law and deeply imbued with European culture and traditions, to which it has also contributed, to the benefit of all Member States. I believe that the European Union will be richer for admitting Iceland and that, from a strategic point of view, this will significantly contribute to a greater EU presence in the northern Atlantic and the Arctic region.</p>

      <p sl="it">With today’s vote, Parliament has also declared itself in favour of Iceland joining the EU. The accession process therefore continues at great pace. This vote emphasises the desire for negotiations on all aspects which are still open to be resolved positively. Whaling is one of the most sensitive issues to be dealt with. We understand that a small country may have its idiosyncrasies and that to upset the balance may be particularly difficult. That aside, I would have expected much wider support for Amendment 22. When it came to bluefin tuna, the European Parliament voted for a moratorium without worrying about the damage that this would cause to the Adriatic fleets. The position taken overstepped the mark and was indeed rejected in Doha by 73 votes to 43 with 24 abstentions. Now, when called on to protect whales, it is amazing that the majority was so narrow. I am sorry that even my own political group put a minus sign against Amendment 22 in its voting list. However, I would like to underline that the Italian delegation voted in favour of the call to stop whaling and abandon all reservations lodged with the International Whaling Commission.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I still believe that a country’s accession to the EU requires true solidarity, not merely one-way solidarity offered by the EU to the candidate country. Accession must provide added value to all parties. My comment is of a general nature and is therefore not aimed specifically at Iceland. I wanted to comment more on the difficulties with which the EU is currently struggling. Certain existing Members of the EU are exhibiting strange behaviour, to say the least, treating the EU as a sort of dumping ground for their problems without worrying too much about the common interest. This kind of problem must be averted with future accessions if we wish to strengthen what remains of cohesion and of our ability to continue with European integration.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is with much enthusiasm that I welcome the opening of membership negotiations between Iceland and the EU. While it was our intention to send a warm message of welcome to Iceland, which is already bound by numerous agreements and partnerships with the EU, we have made it clear, through a number of amendments, that it will have to improve its system of appointing the country’s judges and supreme judicial bodies in order to satisfy the criterion and fundamental principle of the separation of powers and, above all, that it will have to stop whale hunting prior to membership. In addition, being a member of the Arctic Intergroup, I welcome the new influence that the EU will be able to exert as a result of this country’s membership in terms of international strategy for the Arctic.</p>

      <p sl="en">Whilst I will be delighted should Iceland join the ranks of independent nations opting into the EU, today’s resolution contains a glaring contradiction. Paragraph 25 rightly acknowledges Iceland’s success in operating a responsible and sustainable fishing industry – in stark contrast to the EU’s track record. It goes on to call for constructive negotiations on fisheries in order to reach a satisfactory solution, which could presumably include a CFP opt-out. Paragraph 26, however, encourages Iceland to start adopting EU-style mechanisms to facilitate its entry into the CFP. To suggest that Iceland should ditch its responsible, sustainable practices in order to adopt the EU’s failed system is ludicrous. The EU should take lessons from Iceland’s successful national control, not impose failure on a proud fishing nation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of this resolution as Iceland’s accession would offer the European Union the chance to play a more active role in the Arctic Region and would contribute to the multilateral governance of this area. I hope that negotiations will be conducted in a constructive manner and will give Iceland the opportunity to move closer to the European model. Given that national public opinion on EU accession has changed considerably since the option presented in the summer of 2009, and the level of opposition to accession has never been so high, I believe that the authorities should organise, in the near future, a broad information campaign about the implications of this process because this will allow Icelanders to have their say during the future referendum on accession, in full possession of the facts.</p>

Icelanders are already suffering from their government’s betrayal; a government which ignores the sovereign decision made by Icelanders, 95% of whom rejected the law compelling them to pay for the losses suffered by Icesave’s British and Dutch customers. Why would they agree to join an EU that encourages them to accept this disregard for the popular will? According to the latest polls, 57.6% of Icelanders are opposed to joining the EU. I understand them. This is not the kind of Europe they should join.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The start of talks for the accession of Iceland to the EU is good news for all those who argue that the enlargement of the EU is its natural destiny. There is evidence that past enlargements have been a success not only for the EU area, but also for its Member States. For its part, Iceland is a country with which we have maintained good relations for many years, since 1973, and it is also a signatory to the Schengen Agreement and the Dublin Agreement, which means it has already adopted a large part of the acquis communautaire . However, some work remains to be done, especially in the economic and financial area, and in relation to the judicial system.</p>

Therefore, I welcome the work of the Icelandic Government towards accession to the European Union. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a less controversial candidacy than that of Iceland. The fact that Iceland belongs to the European Free Trade Area is also of enormous significance. For this reason, Iceland’s road to membership of the EU should be the shortest ever. In addition, it is hard to forget the contribution which Iceland has made to European cohesion. The tangible effects of EFTA grants are to be found in Poland and other EU countries at almost every step. In view of these facts, I decided to endorse the motion for a resolution to wind up the debate on statements by the Council and Commission pursuant to Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure on Iceland’s application for membership of the European Union. I would also like to voice the hope that votes in Parliament will soon be taking place in the company of Members from Iceland.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the resolution to begin negotiations for Iceland to join the European Union. Geographically, Iceland is already in Europe and membership of the EU is nothing but the normal conclusion to a natural pathway. The recent economic crisis put Iceland in serious difficulties and also created some tense moments with certain EU Member States due to the collapse of several banks in which European citizens had invested. As a result of that, the European Union can step in to find a solution. Membership of the European Union will ensure that Iceland is subjected to controls, and to a common market and rules. Clearly, various things need to be borne in mind during the negotiations, including the problems of fishing quotas, whaling and the supply and management of energy resources.</p>

      <p sl="es">I am very satisfied that the European Parliament has adopted our proposal that Iceland’s membership of the EU should involve the ending of whaling. Specifically, the European Parliament is advising Iceland that whaling does not conform to Union rules, and is asking the country to put an end to the practice. It is also asking Iceland to set aside the country reserves presented to the International Whaling Commission. Otherwise, I give a positive welcome to the recent decision by EU leaders to begin membership negotiations with Iceland, so that it can become the 28th Member State. With today’s vote, we are emphasising that the issue of compensation to the British and Dutch following the collapse of the bank Icesave should be resolved bilaterally.</p>
      <p sl="es">Members have given a favourable welcome to the decision by the European Council on 17 June of this year to begin negotiations on Iceland’s membership of the EU. Parliament is also emphasising the fact that Iceland’s membership would enable the EU to play a more active role in the Arctic, while stressing the country’s ‘strong democratic culture’. Iceland is part of the Schengen Agreement, is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and has had a free trade agreement with the EU since 1973.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that many of you are familiar with Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that any European State may apply to become a member of the Union. Lithuania is a relatively young EU Member State and I feel it would be selfish and hypocritical to slam the door behind us. However, before Lithuania could join the EU in 2004, it had to carry out considerable reforms and agree to painful compromises in order to meet the Union’s accession criteria. The same awaits Iceland. The political and economic earthquake which led to the collapse of the Icelandic banking system in 2008 was a clear warning to the whole of Europe. Iceland is now trying to recover, but it still has a long way to go before its economic stability will be rebuilt. Compensation for Icesave account holders and the repayment of debts to some EU Member States are a good start. This is also important in order to regain society’s trust both in their own country and abroad. Iceland itself has something to offer and that includes its strong democratic tradition, which doubtless would enrich our Union.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Iceland is making a significant contribution to EU environmental and energy policy – the pursuit of renewable energy and its experience combating global warming. It is up to Iceland whether it meets the accession criteria and, in fact, decides to join the Union. In the meantime, we should further strengthen our relations with this country and continue cooperation between the European Parliament and the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the joint debate on the following:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the report by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service [08029/2010 – C7-0090/2010 – 2010/0816(NLE)];</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy [2010/2578(RSP) ].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-316" speaker_id="1263" name="Elmar Brok" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, with the Madrid political agreement, we have taken the first important step towards the creation of a European External Action Service (EAAS). We know that this is not the final result, because the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation provide all the necessary leeway for the codecision procedure, which is a precondition for the final establishment of the service.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this agreement has brought a certain amount of security to the planning and preparation process. We in the European Parliament want to make it clear that we are in favour of the EEAS. The European Parliament’s wish to have a High Representative was included in the Convention for the European Constitution. This High Representative would be responsible for coordinating the external relations of the European Union and for managing the external and security policy of the European Union. The High Representative would have a service at her disposal which would enable her to take up a strong position in relation to the Commission, the Council and the rest of the world, to explain the unity and coherence of European foreign policy and to ensure that we are not just a global payer, but also a global player. This agreement, which will perhaps achieve a majority tomorrow in the European Parliament, represents the necessary step forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">During these negotiations, it was important for us to make the ability of the service to act our main objective, in the common interest of the citizens of Europe. We have also succeeded in the course of these difficult negotiations in guaranteeing that the powers and assignments will not be changed in such a way that what is represented by established Community law and comes under the control and the decision-making authority of the community of Europe turns into intergovernmentalism and renationalisation. Mr Šefčovič, perhaps you will allow me to say that the European Parliament has, on some occasions, done much more for the rights of the Commission over recent months than the Commission itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would once again like to explain that, after some initial hesitation, the Council was prepared to acknowledge the fact that the European Parliament also has a voice in this area, that the combination of the Financial Regulation, the Staff Regulations and this consultation process in fact led to this becoming a codecision procedure and that for this reason, we were able to make important progress in the consultation process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it is extremely important that, as well as guaranteeing the implementation of the Community method and guaranteeing and extending the rights of the European Parliament within the confines of the treaty, not only with regard to justice and internal policy, we find ourselves in a situation with relation to foreign and security policy where, in future and for the first time, we will be consulted and informed before decisions are made. In addition, we will have the opportunity of questioning ambassadors, for example, as part of an exchange of opinions, not in the same way as in the consultation process, but after they have been appointed and before they take up office. For this reason, alongside the opportunities offered by budgetary rights, alongside the fact that treaties with third countries must, in future, be ratified by the European Parliament, we will also have an information and consultation process in the interim phase which will enable Parliament to play a role in structuring European foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is not the case that Parliament wants to take responsibility for operational foreign policy. In future, that will be the task of the executive. We want to have control and we want to be able to say no. We want to be able to take sensible decisions on budgets and we want to be able to carry out checks. Therefore, we need the tools and the information to enable us to exercise Parliament’s rights in these areas on behalf of the citizens of Europe. I believe that this agreement represents an important step in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Baroness Ashton for the fact that we were able to produce good results at the end of the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I want to thank Elmar Brok and Roberto Gualtieri, who were co-rapporteurs and who have also conducted the negotiations with Mrs Ashton, with the Commission and with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The service has now been established, and I think that we can say that we have a good result that all the institutions can support and be proud of. I say this despite the remarks made yesterday by the French Prime Minister, Mr Fillon. He said that the service cannot go beyond certain red lines: the red lines of France. I have to say to Mr Fillon: ‘Vous êtes trop tard ’ – you are too late, because with this agreement on the service, we went far beyond the red lines of France. This was no accident, but simply the full use and implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. It is foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty, which has been ratified by France, to pool foreign policy in the future in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need is not une bataille arrière-garde over the service, as the service is now there. What we need now is to use the service to develop a real EU foreign policy because – let us be honest – until now we have not had a real EU foreign policy at all. I remember when I was a member of the Council in 2002, we spent all of 50 seconds on the Iraq War, which was, at that time, the biggest foreign policy issue. Europe at that time was not capable of discussing it, or of having a common position on it. We must not repeat that, certainly not in the multipolar world of today. Continuing like that is not an option.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will be up to Mrs Ashton, and that is our message today. The service will need clear direction and will need leadership. The treaty has given Mrs Ashton many powers to do this. She has the right to convene a Foreign Affairs Council, even at short notice. She has the power to take initiatives because she is also Vice-President of the Commission. She also has the responsibility to produce the general guidelines setting out the strategic interests of our Union, and all of these responsibilities fall on her and her service.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Ashton, allow me to give you one piece of advice at the end of this whole process of negotiation: develop the service as a Community instrument. The Union’s successes have been built on the tried and tested method which is the Community method. Only where the Community method is applied have we made progress and had success. Look, for example, at the single market. Where it has not been applied, we have had stagnation and even regression. Look, for example, at the Union’s response to the financial crisis. It is only through this method that we can succeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will be through the formulation of what I call a real ‘Union interest’, free from Member State interference, that a foreign policy of the Union can be developed. It is by using the skills and expertise that you will have at your disposal that this real Union interest will be identified. It will then be for Mrs Ashton to defend naturally this Union interest because, in my opinion and the opinion of this Parliament, what is good for the Union is good for its Member States and is also good for its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am delighted to be here to discuss one of the most important issues on the European agenda – the creation of the External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me begin with a word of gratitude for the constructive engagement of Parliament and the rapporteurs – in particular, Elmar Brok, Guy Verhofstadt and Roberto Gualtieri – throughout this process, and to the committees – AFET, Development, Constitutional Affairs, Budget and Budgetary Control, the JURI Committee – whose work has improved the text of the EAS decision in many ways. Thank you also to the President of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have achieved a lot together in recent weeks, building the necessary ground among all concerned. I pay tribute to the other members of the Quadrilogue – Maroš Šefčovič and the Commission and the Spanish Presidency led by Miguel Moratinos, together with colleagues in the Council. I am especially grateful to the legal services who have offered us good advice and support throughout.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time has come to decide.</p>
      <p sl="en">In recent months, there has been, rightly, a lot of attention on the institutional complexities and the administrative intricacies. Laying the foundation is a critical task, but without losing sight of the reasons why we are creating this service, reasons that have become more and more obvious as I have travelled, on your behalf, to visit governments, military missions, and our delegations and programmes across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before going into some of the detail, I would just like to say something about the vision for the Service in the future. There is no better place than this House and no better moment than today to remind ourselves why the Service is so important to the European Union and why it marks a change in how we operate in a fast-changing geopolitical landscape.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot afford to act in a disparate manner in a world that is seeing fundamental power shifts and where problems are increasingly complex and interlinked. We need to defend Europe’s interests and project Europe’s values in a more coherent and effective way, and we should be ambitious in how we do it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union and the Member States have an impressive array of instruments, resources, relationships and expertise to help build a better, more stable world. Now we need to bring all this together, to forge joined-up strategies and maximise our impact on the ground, particularly in the troubled parts of the world where our actions matter the most. Wherever I have travelled – from Gaza to Haiti to East Africa and the Balkans – this has been my key conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU external action will always involve different actors. It is right and proper that development policy operates differently from diplomacy, crisis management or humanitarian aid. Andris Piebalgs, Stefan Füle and Kristalina Georgieva, together with other Commission colleagues, have clear, distinct roles, and I pay tribute to the work they are doing, but under Lisbon, we have the opportunity to operate together under one shared comprehensive political strategy – an aspiration now becoming reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">My vision for the EEAS is one which ensures that when we speak, our voice is heard and when we engage, our actions make the difference. Our citizens know very well that in the face of big problems – fragile states, pandemics, energy security, climate change and illegal migration – we are much more effective together.</p>
      <p sl="en">That effectiveness requires us to mobilise all the means at our disposal – diplomacy, political engagement, development assistance, civil and military crisis management tools – in support of conflict prevention, peace building, security and stability. This is important for the future of Europe and important for the future of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have seen myself what we are capable of when we work together. When I travelled to East Africa, I saw what our naval operation, Atalanta, was doing very well offshore, but I also saw the important capacity building and development work onshore. As those engaged in our military mission were quick to say, the solution to the problems at sea lies on the land. That is why, working with Andris Piebalgs, we are making sure our programmes work better together, and why I will be returning to meet again with the leaders of Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa, Mozambique, the regional organisations and the African Union, to discuss how we can support African leadership to find political solutions on the ground, and how we can support the people of Somalia to a better future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know what we can do and what we are doing and I also know what we can achieve for the future. I am ambitious, I confess, for I believe it is time to move forward and to get the Service up and running quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a good deal on the table: a draft decision and a set of declarations that form a coherent package. Mr President, I am submitting them formally to the record of today’s proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not dwell on each and every aspect, but let me highlight just a few specific points on how we have found the proper safeguards in areas that I know are important to this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">First and foremost, the text makes clear that we are safeguarding the Community method in all areas where it exists today. The External Action Service will cooperate closely with the Commission services as part of the EU system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, I know how important political accountability is for this House. I am confident that a good framework has been found through the political declaration on political accountability. I am looking forward to the intense dialogue and exchange of information with the European Parliament and will make sure that my collaborators give high priority to this aspect of their work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The many obligations inherent in my position do not allow me to be present as often as I would like in your debates, but I am happy that we have a system for my replacement in such cases, involving, in particular, colleagues from the Commission and, from time to time, also members of the Foreign Affairs Council, from the rotating Presidency or the Presidency trio.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, financial accountability. I am satisfied that we have clear language and guarantees regarding sound financial management, including appropriate solutions to issues such as discharge and sub-delegation of budgetary powers to heads of delegation. As a sign of the importance I attach to this issue, I envisage a senior management team that not only has a chief executive officer in the Executive Secretary-General but also a chief operating officer in the senior Director-General for Budget and Administration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, we have agreed carefully balanced arrangements regarding development policy and instruments. I know there was some concern that we might lose sight of development policy in the new set-up. Believe me, the opposite is the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Development is central to EU external action. It has given us a strong profile on the international stage as the world’s leading donor, so our cooperation programmes are a key tool in our bilateral and regional relationships. That remains the case in the new Lisbon context, but development cannot be pursued on its own, separate from other strands of external relations. That is why we are creating a strong common platform, allowing us to work together – Andris Piebalgs, Stefan Füle and myself – to ensure that general development objectives and poverty reduction in particular are mainstreamed in our cooperation programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fifth, we have a balanced agreement on staff issues, between the wishes of Member States to have at least one third of staff in the Service coming from national diplomatic services – so we can draw on their expertise, language and historical ties – while, at the same time, ensuring at least 60% of permanent officials. In the same way, I am clear we need to ensure a proper gender and geographical balance, and not lose sight of wider diversity issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am personally committed to this. Diversity is strength. A service that represents the EU should reflect that diversity. The wealth of experience, insights and languages that Europe’s best diplomats will bring to the Service will be one of our distinctive features and competitive advantages.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sixth, you will have seen my Declaration on the EAS central administration. The idea is that we all have a shared understanding on how the Service will look.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to try to get things right at the beginning, while giving ourselves the chance to review how things work in light of new priorities and developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Members of this House have asked a number of questions on the handling of crisis management and peace building. I will ensure that the relevant units from the Commission will deal with planning and programming of crisis response, conflict prevention and peace building, and that the CSDP structures work in close cooperation and synergy, both under my direct responsibility and authority within the appropriate structure. This is, of course, without prejudice to the specific nature, notably intergovernmental and communitarian, of the policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Effective coordination of the work of the various departments in the EAS will be key. Under my direct authority and responsibility, full coordination between all the services of the EAS, in particular, between the CSDP structures and the other relevant services of the EAS, will be ensured, respecting their specific nature.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will also ensure that the right coordination is established between the EU special representatives and the relevant departments in the Service.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, this House has also always paid great attention to human rights issues. It is a priority I fully share and I promise that, as High Representative, I will give high priority to the promotion of human rights and good governance around the globe and make sure they are a silver thread that runs through everything that we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">There will be a human rights and democracy structure at headquarters level as well as focal points in all relevant Union delegations with the task of monitoring the human rights situation and promoting an effective realisation of EU human rights policy goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, Europe needs the External Action Service to build a stronger foreign policy. We need an integrated platform to project European values and interests around the world. It is time to give ourselves the means to realise the ambition. It is time to get the right people in place to start doing the necessary work.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with the amendments that have been proposed and will support them in the Council. It is important now that we move rapidly also with the amendments for the Staff and Financial Regulations and an amending budget for 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I began, I thank you for your cooperation and I count on your support. The vote you will make tomorrow, I hope, is an historic step in the development of the European Union and, although it is not our final destination, it is a key staging post in realising our shared vision for the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to welcome to the table Parliament’s opinion and strongly support its adoption, because I see that this positive vote will be an important moment in the establishment of the EAS and it will be a clear important signal that the new service is receiving the democratic endorsement of this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="en">This decision will also be an appropriate reflection of the important role that the European Parliament has played in the discussions over the new service. I have to express my high appreciation of the intensive work Cathy Ashton, the High Representative, has done over the last few months. It is not every day that we establish a new service. Even though it was difficult, it was complicated, we have managed to reach a political consensus in seven months since the new treaty came into force, which is, I think, a remarkable achievement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this is a testimony to the fact that Cathy Ashton achieved a very solid balance when she proposed the decision for the first time, but the decision as it was drafted needed to go through this democratic scrutiny process, and I think that the process was a very thorough one. If I look at the discussions we had in the quadrilogue with Miguel Moratinos, the Members of this Parliament, the rapporteurs Brok, Verhofstadt and Gualtieri, and us on the side of the Commission, I can tell you that we looked at every possible article and at every possible provision. We were always looking for the best possible solution and I really think that we have achieved it.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, the debate focused on three areas. The first one was how we can ensure that EEAS will be a fully-fledged part of the EU system. We have discussed this very thoroughly, and I think that we will achieve it and have a truly European External Action Service. The second very important issue was how to secure appropriate financial accountability. Here, again, we have been looking at all the possible options and I am sure now that even though we are going to create something new, where there will be three sources for the people who will work for the External Action Service, we will have all the appropriate financial accountability safeguards built into the system and I am sure that the system will weather the test of its future operation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last big part of the discussion focused on development aid: how to manage it appropriately, how to keep the communitarian spirit of development aid and how to secure this Parliament’s right of democratic scrutiny. Again, I think we put a lot of ingenuity and thinking into the work, a lot of creative solutions, and I think that we have found a solution which will bring the best possible synergies. We can bring in the expertise of the Member States, expertise from the Commission, in-field contacts of our delegations, and I am sure that with this synergy, we will be much more efficient when representing the European Union abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am looking forward very much to supporting the Commission’s consent to this decision later this month and I can assure you that the Commission will do its utmost to cooperate very closely with the High Representative, with the Council and with Parliament to complete the process, finalising the issues on financial regulations and staff regulations, and to complete the budgetary process. I am already looking forward very much now to the efficient and excellent work of the External Action Service as from autumn of this year.</p>

I want, briefly, to explain the intentions of the Committee on Development. In stating its opinion, the committee has concentrated on several of the most important matters.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, we wanted the objectives of development cooperation to be more strongly incorporated into a variety of European Union policies in order to defend the autonomy and independence of development cooperation. In other words, we did not want development cooperation to become a carrot – as someone has said – in the arsenal of diplomatic instruments. I would like to thank Mrs Ashton very much for what she has said today, and for her statements on development cooperation, because this was very important for the Committee on Development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, we wanted control over operational expenses incurred by financial instruments to be exercised more unambiguously by the Commissioner for Development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, we wanted staff of the new service not to be just professional diplomats from Member States, but also staff who have worked in a wide range of situations in the external world, with a background in development, commerce and security.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report by Elmar Brok and Guy Verhofstadt on the functioning of the European External Action Service (EEAS) is a compromise and, like every compromise, it has both positive and negative aspects. We consider the main positive aspect to be the fact that the EEAS will be accountable to the European Parliament as far as political and budgetary control is concerned. However, this Parliamentary supervision should be strengthened further to take sufficient account of the position of national parliaments, especially concerning the foreign policy and security priorities which the EEAS will assert on behalf of the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As far as practical functioning is concerned, it is a pity that the report does not include the opinion of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade, which was unanimously supported in committee by fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. The essence of this opinion was a clarification of powers in relation to the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Trade, conforming to the definition under Articles 207 and 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mrs Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, the report on which we are preparing to vote is not a simple opinion, but the result of intense negotiating efforts, for which I would like to thank the High Representative and the Spanish Presidency. These are negotiations in which Parliament played a prominent role in significantly improving the text of the decision that the Council will have to adopt.</p>
      <p sl="it">The compromise reached in Madrid is fully in line with the objectives that guided this highly coordinated work carried out by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt: to provide Europe with a service that has resources and powers sufficient to increase the consistency and effectiveness of the EU’s external action, but which is, at the same time, closely linked to the Community method and the Commission, and subject to the full democratic control of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">I, too, would like to say to those who have mentioned so-called red lines that the European Parliament must not cross, that it is precisely because Parliament has been able to exercise its prerogatives fully and dynamically, and even cross some of the red lines outlined by governments, that Europe will have a more effective, more democratic and more European service. I am talking about a service, for instance, that is able to reconcile development cooperation policies with the rest of the EU’s external action, without undermining either the necessary independence of those policies or the Commission’s responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament shall continue to make strong and determined use of its legislative and budget prerogatives, especially over the coming months, in order to define the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation in accordance with the basic outline of this report. It will also carefully supervise the actual development of the service and ensure that the letter and spirit of the Madrid Agreement are fully respected, beginning with the proper participation of European officials at the helm of the service and in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) budget reform.</p>
      <p sl="it">It will also make use of these prerogatives to provide the High Representative of the service’s officials with its full support as the European Parliament, an institution which cares more than any other about the development of a true European foreign policy and about its gradual communitisation, in which the Madrid Agreement is an important stage.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I am also wearing two hats today. I am speaking both as rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. In both of these roles, I am deputising for my colleague, Mrs Brantner, who gave birth to a daughter about six weeks ago and has therefore handed her work over to me. I would like to thank her very much at this point for all her preparatory work and her support.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality put the emphasis on the question of equality of the sexes among the staff of the European External Action Service (EEAS). We have succeeded in ensuring an equal balance of men and women in the agreement and, Baroness Ashton, I am hoping for your commitment in this area. I am assuming that you will also apply the principle of equality of opportunity for men and women and equal treatment for men and women at work which is enshrined in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and will ensure representation on all levels, including Heads of Delegation, when appointing your staff.</p>
      <p sl="de">As shadow rapporteur for the Greens, I would like to thank Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri for their cooperation. I would also like to explain that we have worked together to introduce a large number of improvements to the original draft in order to create a coherent, common and more effective European foreign policy. This is why my group is supporting this report and will vote in favour of it tomorrow. The report includes a strong human rights structure, guarantees for development policy, an increase in our democratic control, for example, future EU ambassadors will have to take part in a hearing in front of this House before taking up their positions, and a transparent budget for foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the fact that there are no clear structures for civil crisis management and prevention. In addition, the EEAS will offer few consular services for the citizens of Europe. We want to see a strong framework for civil crisis prevention and management and for peace building, with a focus on civil issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">The compromise is not exactly what we wanted, but with goodwill and an ambitious approach, Baroness Ashton, it will still be possible to implement it. However, this will only work if your intention is to ensure that individual national interests are pushed into the background, in particular, with regard to the priority given to military matters, which France has been highlighting in recent weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">You must take an ambitious approach to putting our common European thoughts and actions into effect. You should make sure that you have the support of Parliament and not focus on the interests of individual Member States.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, Baroness Ashton, one of the main problems which we faced in recent months entailed Parliament being able to receive all the instruments necessary to exert tight control over the expenditure for the European external action budget.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The particular institutional nature of the European External Action Service raised numerous issues relating to the transparency, cost-saving nature and effectiveness of its budget.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I am pleased that, thanks to the numerous active efforts from colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control, from the European Commission and from you personally, Baroness Ashton, we managed to find the best solutions enabling Parliament to adopt the decision for creating the service.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The clear responsibility and model for the whole budgetary procedure inspire confidence in us that the European Union’s foreign policy will be drafted and implemented in a sufficiently effective manner by all the institutions committed to this, in keeping with clear rules of accountability.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We endeavoured with our work to give the green light as quickly as possible to the creation of the European External Action Service. I hope that we will demonstrate as soon as possible that the mechanisms which have been adopted are working well. In practical terms, this means that the interests of European taxpayers are fully protected.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the daily events in every part of the world continue to reinforce the need to get the European diplomatic service up and running as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">The political agreement reached should be regarded as nothing other than an excellent starting point and an extremely positive sign for the actual start-up of the service. The objectives that have been identified, namely the fact that the service should be strong and should allow the European Union to strengthen its role on the international stage, the importance of maintaining and strengthening the Community method within the service itself, and the guarantee of budgetary and political monitoring by Parliament will ensure – I am certain – tangible results.</p>
      <p sl="it">A few points still have to be clarified, however, and they relate to what is arguably the most crucial aspect where the implementation of the service is concerned. I refer to the ambiguous stance taken by many governments. Although they were crossed when the recent Madrid Agreement was signed, the red lines mentioned by Mr Gualtieri do nonetheless count on an informal level, given the ambiguous behaviour of many governments that I spoke about just now. I am thinking of the statements made yesterday by Mr Moratinos of the outgoing Presidency, who was therefore, in many ways, rightfully anxious to insist on this result, which he stated clearly when speaking of human rights in Cuba: in this sector, bilateral agreements should be preferred over a common European position.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, Commissioner, we would run an enormous risk if we encouraged this ambiguity, if we promoted the fact that, behind the much-celebrated political agreement, there might actually be hiding yet another round of negotiations over positions and powers instead of the development of an effective mechanism. I am convinced that you will be able to achieve the results that we all desire.</p>

      <p sl="de">Of course, it is now a question of ensuring that some governments give the diplomatic service a chance, quite apart from the fact that the French Government now has problems which are very different from the red lines. They should get rid of their red lines, because this is not what it is all about. Many of the citizens of Europe are concerned that there will be too much diplomacy in Europe. However, we are not talking about doubling the size of the diplomatic service, but about strengthening it. Therefore, some governments will have to reduce their diplomatic services in parallel with the development of the European Union diplomatic service. That is the purpose of these measures and we fully support them. It will result in the individual governments giving Baroness Ashton and the diplomatic service a major opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that the Belgian Presidency will be the first Presidency to take up this opportunity and give Baroness Ashton its total support, naturally, in consultation with the foreign minister and the foreign ministry. We need to put more Europe into our foreign policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the vote is approaching and it is time to take stock. On the credit side, the results of the negotiations include your choice of a board of management solution for the service, which will be responsible for advising you. This makes considerably more sense than the structure which was originally planned, with an all-powerful Secretary-General working alone.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second very positive point is the increase in political accountability. This will improve the quality of the debates in Brussels and in Europe on foreign policy and will help to reduce the democratic deficit a little in this area. For my group, the strong human rights structure is very important and we are pleased about it.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there is also a debit side. You have not succeeded in setting up or you were not prepared to set up a permanent political representation which is really worthy of the name. It is true that a solution has been found for the European Parliament but, although we sometimes do not see it like this, the European Parliament is not the world. You will have to be represented in other places – Mallorca and Kiev come to mind – as you have been criticised for not being able to be everywhere at once. I would very much like to have seen you resolving this in a different way.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have also just said, ‘You will have seen my declaration on the central administration’. My problem is that we have heard two explanations of the concept of central administration. You gave an explanation to the Permanent Representatives Committee (Coreper) 48 hours after the agreement in Madrid in which you refer not only to the Council decision of October 2009 but also to Protocol 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon. In my opinion, this explanation conflicts with what was agreed in Madrid. Today, you have given us an explanation, here in front of the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe, which I hope will replace the explanation which you made to the Coreper on 23 June 2010. You cannot talk, on the one hand, about an appropriate structure for crisis management and, on the other, explain to the Coreper that the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) will be solely responsible for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">My specific question to you is: Does the explanation which you have given here today in the plenary of the European Parliament replace the explanation which you made to the Coreper? Please do not say that there is no contradiction between the two explanations. The contradiction is obvious and anyone who puts the two explanations side by side will identify it immediately. Either there will be an appropriate structure, or you will create something new along the lines of what Mrs Lunacek just said, or we have a problem.</p>

I also wish to encourage the High Representative to act effectively in the spirit of this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am very glad that there is to be a clearly identifiable unit, a department, at central level, which will be responsible for the inclusion of human rights in all areas of external action. We need to ensure that this department is at a level that is as high up as possible, so that it can really have an impact on all external relations. It has also been agreed that parties responsible for human rights will be included in all EU delegations abroad; these will be responsible for these issues at local level. Now, we also have to ensure that a new approach is born between Parliament, the European External Action Service and the High Representative, one that echoes the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, which means that we are keen to be engaged in more consistent and robust foreign policy in the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European External Action Service, or what we would prefer to be known as the EU Diplomatic Service, has been subject to a prolonged bout of wrangling over its composition recently. Thankfully, this has now ended, and High Representative Ashton emerges with considerable credit for her administrative skills and consensual approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">British Conservatives were opposed to the creation of the EEAS, but we are now reconciled to engaging constructively, though not uncritically, with it. The EEAS as now proposed inevitably represents a compromise – in my view, an acceptable compromise – but perhaps we should expect this from a hybrid sui generis independent institution which has never been seen before.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally would have liked a greater emphasis on the intergovernmental Council-led approach and a merit-based selection of national and EU diplomats, as opposed to national quotas – as well as some political appointees, and why not the odd ex-prime minister or two? Nevertheless I welcome the EEAS strategic role over development and aid policy and the modest increases in powers acquired for this Parliament, such as confirmation hearings for senior appointees and the budgetary and Staff Regulation powers which are clear in the treaties. This will further increase democratic oversight of the service.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I hope that national MPs will also be closely involved from the beginning in new formal structures for scrutinising the EEAS. This is especially important from the point of view of the military CSDP missions, which are funded from national, not EU, budgets. The UK is a significant contributor to such missions and our national MPs must be kept fully appraised and on board if these missions are to retain popular support back home.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, regrettably, my group will not be voting in favour of the report on the European External Action Service (EEAS) tomorrow. I am sorry about this.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are not going to do so because, firstly, pressure from some member States has been yielded to during this very complex creation process and because, secondly, our political group has not succeeded in ensuring that what we believed to be essential when it came to structuring and supervising the EEAS in some way has been taken into account. From the outset, we did not want it to be transformed into a sui generis body, which would ensure that the European Parliament and national Parliaments had control, not only budgetary control, as has occurred in Madrid, but also parliamentary and political control. It should be recalled that we are the only democratically elected institution within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We were especially concerned that the military structures of the European Union, together with the civilian-military ones, formed part of the EEAS. We believe it to be an error to link the EEAS to institutions involving military personnel: the European Defence Agency and the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate, not to mention intelligence services.</p>
      <p sl="es">From our point of view, the scheduling, planning and implementation of financial instruments in particular, and instruments in general, should not come under the EEAS. We also believe that, given the substantial military orientation that the EEAS has – that is how we see it – the main civilian component of European policy with regard to foreign affairs can, and should, remain under the umbrella of European security and defence policy, specifically, everything relating to development cooperation and conflict resolution.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a result, regrettably, my group will not be voting in favour of this report, as it would appear not to resolve the essential issues. It is true that things moved on in Madrid: they moved on with regard to budgetary control. Nevertheless, we are all conscious that the European Parliament will not have the final word.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is something much deeper and more significant about the External Action Service, which is rooted in international law about what constitutes a nation state.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the guiding 1933 Montevideo Convention, which the EU has accepted, there are four separate qualifications for a state: a permanent population, defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into diplomatic relations with other states. The EU already possesses three of these four: a permanent population – the Lisbon Treaty makes us all EU citizens; a defined territory – the EU nations all have clear, defined boundaries; a government – well, UKIP has long argued that this Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the real power, the Commission, are all part of an EU government. That leaves the fourth and final component: the capacity for a nation state to enter into relations with other nation states.</p>

The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is opposed to the development of this European diplomatic service on every conceivable level. This service is a product of the terrible Treaty of Lisbon, which was resoundingly rejected by the Dutch voters and quite rightly, as it turns out. Plans are now being made for European super diplomacy, in a manner that is completely undemocratic and over which we have no control. Nobody knows how it will work in practice, and yet the EU is grabbing more and more powers for itself.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, foreign policy is no business of the EU. That is the job of the Member States, who should retain complete control of it. Besides, Baroness Ashton’s plans will result in considerable cost to the taxpayer. The budget is already heavily overrun as it is, and yet Baroness Ashton wants a Situation Centre with an aircraft for herself, as well as her own staff and an expenses budget of several million a year. When is this madness going to stop? All this unelected Euro-elite wants is to be able to act exactly as it pleases. The citizens can only stand by and watch without being allowed to say anything, and yet they are the ones who have to foot the sky high bill. This is making a mockery of democracy!</p>

We are going to have a Dutch Embassy and a Dutch Consulate and, on top of that, a European diplomatic representation abroad.

It is a Community instrument that will have to implement foreign policy and external action decisions and, before that, support and facilitate the decision-making process under the authority of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission, and in coordination with other relevant institutional actors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s main concerns were clearly expressed, ensuring political oversight and accountability of the service, including in its budgetary dimension. This, in turn, requires transparency in the functioning of the service and clarity through the presentation of a consolidated budget of the European Union External Action. In this way, the Parliament can check whether the means match the policy and ensure the policy’s effectiveness. This report and the agreement it stands for meet the abovementioned European Parliament demands. Moreover, a process of fine tuning and revision is provided for, so as to tackle, in due time, the unforeseen problems and deficiencies that may arise.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it now appears that we have a broad agreement on the instruments, processes and personnel. What we now need is an argument about policy. We ought to be sufficiently brave to compare, to contrast and to contest each other’s national foreign policies. If we fail to put ourselves through such an argument, a common security and defence policy cannot emerge.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think Baroness Ashton ought to be posing some tough questions. For instance, why do five states still oppose recognition of the independence of Kosovo? Why is Greece permitted to block the emergence of Macedonia as a state? Why is there still a cold war between Turkey and Cyprus? I do hope that, through asking that kind of tough question, the creative and courageous proposals for solutions will emerge. For instance, the proposal to launch a concerted CSDP mission to combat international organised crime is precisely the kind of policy that we are now seeking from Baroness Ashton, serviced by this top class diplomacy that we are to put in place.</p>

I should like to emphasise development cooperation as a European project. The rapporteur for the Committee on Development, Mr Kaczmarek, has already said that development cooperation must not be used by Europe as bait to get its own way abroad. I am therefore very pleased with the changes, as formulated in the final proposal for the EEAS, whereby the responsibility for development cooperation will continue to lie with Commissioner Piebalgs.

So I welcome the good work of our rapporteurs in their negotiations with Baroness Ashton. Their most significant success is securing agreement that this Parliament will scrutinise the budget of the Service. At a time of austerity, we must ensure that taxpayers’ money is not wasted on superfluous expenditure, such as a European diplomatic training college, which happens all too often in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, there are two reasons why I am opposed to the report by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt. First of all, I sense an unhealthy thirst for power among many of my fellow Members. If the European Parliament alone is involved, that is fine, whatever it is involved in. As if Baroness Ashton did not already have her hands full, we are giving her a top-heavy External Action Service on top of that. I am almost beginning to suspect that you are deliberately trying to make the High Representative and her service go off the rails.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second complaint concerns the institutional set-up of this service. The experience of recent months has made it clear that the institutional experiment of having two hats, as it were, has not been an unqualified success. And, as if that were not enough, we are paving the way for a couple of thousand diplomats who will all be wearing two hats. What a spectacle! When will this Parliament realise that the exploitation of the grey area between the Council and the Commission is not working and that it is creating nothing but a lack of clarity and tension between the institutions?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is a positive thing that the European Parliament is getting a certain amount of say over the European External Action Service. The first measure of Parliament’s control will be the budget and, in all other respects, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy will have to be accountable to Parliament. That would, in fact, be the perfectly normal thing to happen in a democratic system or in what a democratic system ought to be. However, we must not raise false expectations amongst the citizens of the European Union. We might have a European diplomatic service now, but if Member States do not have any common vision on foreign policy, that service will obviously remain, in large part, an empty shell. I would therefore call for realism, but I fear that we are not all on the same wavelength here, particularly after finding an article on our Parliament’s website whose title translates as ‘European Parliament introduces new diplomatic service to bring it closer to its citizens’. Unfortunately, no explanation was given as to how exactly that is going to happen, but it is precisely this sort of hollow propaganda that is turning more and more people in the European Union against it.</p>

The long awaited EEAS finally comes into being. In order to face new challenges, we need new instruments, and this is such an instrument. In particular, we need an efficient EU diplomacy capable of speaking with one voice, acting together and pooling resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it is essential to look above and beyond the details and technical arrangements of the new diplomatic service. First, without strong democratic political legitimacy, the EEAS cannot be efficient. This legitimacy stems from the European Parliament and national parliaments and their scrutiny, which should relate to the foreign policy’s main directions and basic choices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, to have a stronger EEAS, it has to be representative of the whole European Union, the Union of all 27 Member States, old and new, small, medium and large, stretching from north to south, from east to west, with their particular interests and sensitivities. This is why it is so important to build a sense of common ownership, common identity and diplomatic culture based on geographic balance and representivity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope our Parliament will succeed in improving the Council decision and, by doing so, making the new service more communitarian, more accountable in political and budgetary terms and more geographically representative, thus winning citizens’ trust and support.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express how pleased I am that the European External Action Service is already taking real shape and that it will be fully up and running as an organisation very soon.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Just six months ago, quite a few fellow Members expressed doubts as to whether Catherine Ashton, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, would be able to tackle the challenges presented by the new post, entrusted with considerable powers, as well as considerable responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I think that time has refuted these doubts and Baroness Ashton has managed, in an extremely skilful way, to create the foundations of the new service, which I wish to congratulate her on. We must also give the European Parliament its due. It has chosen, from the very outset, an approach based on cooperation, which I hope we will also observe when we adopt the amendments in the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations.</p>
      <p sl="bg">One of the most contentious topics was, and still remains, the one referred to as ‘geographical balance’. In other words, the fair representation of Member States. This issue mainly concerns new Member States, which are still greatly undervalued, in terms of both numbers of representatives and positions in the hierarchy. I myself come from such a country and I can assure you that we will be making a mistake if we fail to preserve a high degree of sensitivity to this issue. This is the only way we will guarantee that all European citizens will feel that they are adequately represented in the new service.</p>
      <p sl="bg">At the same time, I call on the diplomatic services in the new Member States to adopt measures aimed at obtaining additional qualifications and training, when necessary, so that they field competitive candidates. Finally, I would like clear guarantees given as of right now that no misuse will be tolerated, in any way, of positions in the diplomatic service for resolving purely national problems to the detriment of the European Union’s long-term objectives and interests.</p>

Keeping Commissioner Piebalgs and Commissioner Georgieva in their posts, with responsibility for cooperation and humanitarian aid respectively, remains the sine qua non for preserving EU institutional policy coherence in the areas concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This does not mean that synergies should not be sought within the European External Action Service. On the contrary, it is essential to create such synergies, just as it is becoming essential to speak with one voice. What matters is that those who speak on behalf of the EU are not contradicted by Member States’ foreign ministers, not all of whom have perhaps yet understood the message. However, this requires a genuine EU foreign policy, and creating one is a major challenge. To begin with, we need to have one opinion on the major foreign policy issues, one opinion, not two opinions, on security, one opinion, not two opinions, on Turkey.</p>

The draft resolution leaves many blanks to be completed and lacks many details.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is with unease that we observe the attempt made by certain countries to appropriate the most important positions and diplomatic missions. The lack of a conciliatory approach in the distribution of jobs, particularly with regard to the geographical criterion, as well as the isolation of the EEAS from national parliaments, are a cause of serious concern. The Committee on Foreign Affairs rejected an amendment which would have enabled the parliaments of Member States to be fully involved in control and supervision of common foreign and security policy as well as security and defence policy. Depriving the EEAS the legitimisation of national parliaments demonstrates a move towards creating a special club and alienating it from the nations of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Indeed, this is an important milestone in the creation of a common European policy in areas as sensitive as foreign affairs, security and defence. Every day, from Georgia to the coasts of Somalia, from the Balkans to Gaza, we can clearly see how much this common policy is needed and also – I was going to say above all – how much our citizens want it. Because, above and beyond the interinstitutional powers which we are welcoming today in this compromise and, in particular, the increased role given to Parliament, we must clearly emphasise the strategic opportunity represented by this External Action Service, which is an essential tool for equipping the EU with a more ambitious, more consistent, more credible and more effective common foreign and security policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, may I say to you, as Chair of Parliament’s Subcommittee on Security and Defence and also, to some extent, as a Frenchman, that I insist on the particular responsibility which you will have to exercise, that of crisis management, by preserving and strengthening the EU’s unique character and added value, in other words, its civil-military capabilities – the two words go together. You are the one who will be responsible for ensuring that the EU maintains and increases its capabilities by rejecting the ill-founded suspicions that are voiced here and there – and indeed sometimes in this Chamber – to the effect that the service will be militarised, and by joining with Parliament as much as possible in clearly affirming the legitimacy of any operations conducted by the EU in crisis locations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Those in this Chamber who are rightly worried about the balance of national representation should support the High Representative in pursuing appointment by merit, precisely because it will break the post-colonial link between some countries and regions of the world which they see as clients, and it is therefore in the ultimate interest of genuine pro-European working which looks to the future and not the past.</p>

In January, during the hearings for the new European Commission, my group and I criticised the plan according to which the Commissioner for Development was to become a sort of a manager for one part of the policy only, without having any responsibilities of his or her own. At the time, we were facing a return to a development policy that was subordinate to geopolitical goals and commercial interests and a return to the kind of cynicism with which – even in Europe – dictators have clung onto power for decades at the expense of their people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The structure has now been significantly improved and I wish to pay my compliments to the rapporteurs for that. Obviously, development policy is an integral part of foreign policy, which is supervised and coordinated by Catherine Ashton.

That enables the EU to play the role it needs to play in the fight against poverty and in the protection of the rights of the citizens of developing countries.

Please remember, though, that talented officials and diplomats from the new Member States obviously do not have a decade or more of experience in Union institutions but, at the same time, their knowledge and abilities make them ideally qualified to take up senior positions in the central office or the branches of the new service.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Ashton, the External Action Service is a positive move towards the consolidation of Europe. It is going to represent Europe, but I think it should also pursue objectives which are fundamental for the Union and all Member States, including, for example, European Union energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, it is important that the future staff of the service should be experts in very different areas of European activity, and not just diplomacy itself. So the service should include experts in the fields of economics, economic development and energy. The rules for recruitment of staff for the External Action Service should, therefore, be sufficiently flexible so that as well as meeting the geographical criteria, the service also employs world-class specialists from outside the field of public administration. This is something which has been suggested by non-governmental organisations, and I think it can help us achieve our objectives. Therefore, for example, representatives of the Directorate-General for Energy should be recruited to the service.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the creation of the European External Action Service is a big step forward in the right direction. Moreover, it will be a major change of pattern. If, as a rule, bureaucracy slows down courageous initiatives, this time we expect to accelerate one, namely, foreign policy integration, within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">My remarks address the apparent gap between our current efforts to provide the service with a solid legal and administrative base and the reality of manning it because, while we are fiercely debating important principles like geographic balance and corrective measures, job interviews are taking place in parallel. According to opinions explained by those interviewed from the new Member States, the process seems to entail little hope for them – which, if true, would be both sad and unfair. Therefore, I think that those in charge should be convinced that in the end, one way or another, the principles agreed upon in this House will have to be complied with – the sooner the better.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Yesterday in this House, we received a visit from a man who is neither a diplomat nor a foreign policy expert. I am referring to Mr John Ging, the Head of UNRWA in Gaza. He has told us more about the problems of Gaza and the Middle East than all the diplomats and special envoys headed up by Mr Blair – and we do not know what he is actually doing there in any case – and foreign ministers who do not wish to visit Gaza and who are unwilling to deal with serious problems.</p>
      <p sl="sl">My point is: I congratulate you on establishing the European External Action Service and I thank you for the efforts that you and Members of this Parliament have made in order to make this service as effective as possible. However, its value will depend upon the extent of its creativity and the amount of intellectual output it generates.

      <p sl="es">I would like to congratulate not only the High Representative, but also those involved – such as, for example, within the European Parliament, our colleague Mr Brok – who have facilitated the achievement of the agreements that were necessary for this. I especially liked the phrase that you used, Baroness Ashton, about how it is the interests of the European Union that need to be defended above all.</p>

      <p sl="en">In setting up this highly important post-Lisbon institutional body, the result we have largely meets the interests of the European Parliament and of European integration more generally. It is very important that Parliament managed to maintain the Community method in the functioning of the EEAS, as well as the power of budgetary oversight. It is also very important that the motion for a resolution reiterates the principle of geographical balance with regard to the recruitment process within the EEAS. We should insist that this principle remains strong and is duly upheld in the later stages of the development of the service.</p>

Yet if this is to be achieved, all of us – Parliament, the High Representative, the Commission and the Member States – need to do what we can and, at the moment, so much is lacking. This is all about giving practical expression to promoting the European Union’s values and founding principles, which should guide its actions elsewhere in the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Peace and justice cannot be achieved without development, but there can be no development without human rights, democracy, rule of law or empowering women. Human safety and the responsibility to protect the public are central concepts in using tools for European external action and policy development for the Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given this, the European Union cannot continue to do without a seat on the UN Security Council. I hope, Mrs Ashton, that you will not waste time and that you will lead the European Union to engage in the urgent reform of the UN Security Council.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the European External Action Service should not replace national diplomacy and I hope it does not have such ambitions. This means it should concentrate its attention mainly on something Mrs Hautala and Mr Grzyb spoke about – human rights issues.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the High Representative is supposed to receive a mandate from the Council which contains the representatives of Member States. However, we have heard today from the rapporteurs that ‘the foreign policy must not be subject to renationalisation’ and ‘it will break the red lines laid down by Member States’. Lastly, ‘foreign policy must be free from Member States’ interference’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council is supposed to provide the High Representative with a mandate but its members must not interfere. The discussions in AFCO have made it quite clear that the institution to which the European External Action Service will be closest will be the Commission, of which, of course, the High Representative is also Vice-President.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the Constitutional Treaty was replaced by the Lisbon Treaty, the British Government took the initiative to disguise the EU Foreign Minister as the innocuous sounding High Representative.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank all honourable Members who have been able to offer general or sometimes qualified support. For those of you who feel unable to support the proposition, I hope, over time, to win you round and I hope that you will indeed end up being proud of what we have created together. By the way, I have never suggested I should have an aeroplane.</p>
      <a text="(Interruption from the floor)"/>
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much. If you wish to offer me one, that is different! But I have never suggested it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I answer a few specific points, many of which were mentioned several times by honourable Members. I will begin with something that Mrs Lunacek began with: the need to consider equal opportunities very carefully. It is not only a question of equal opportunities. It is also equality of access: ensuring the processes and procedures that we put in place make it possible to bring about the geographical and gender balance that honourable Members have discussed. Ensuring our processes and procedures are capable of that is one thing that I have had much experience of, so I will do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of honourable Members – Mr Kalfin and Ms Gräßle in particular – talked about resources. I completely understand and recognise that we have to use resources well. I am very well aware of the economic backdrop against which this Service is coming into being. However, even if the economic backdrop were different, I would want to see an efficient Service operating well and using resources extremely well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically on staff, because a number of people have asked and because I see all kinds of numbers being bandied around: we currently have about 800 diplomatic staff, a third of whom operate overseas. I will give you three comparisons: France has 6 300, the Netherlands 2 000, Spain 1 000. There are Member States who have many fewer staff; there are many Member States who have comparable numbers. However, I think that will give you a sense of where we currently are.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also mindful that I am asking staff to operate in a post-Lisbon Treaty era, where the jobs that the rotating Presidency used to do are no longer done by them. That means for some of our delegations – particularly New York and Geneva, where additional staff would have been put in to cover for each Presidency – that we are very short of people. My commitment to you is to have an efficient service that is capable of doing the job that we have all agreed needs to be done. I am very comfortable that we will have full transparency in doing that. I am very comfortable with the role that the European Parliament will be playing as regards the Committee on Budgets and budget discharge. That is my commitment and I will do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Graf Lambsdorff, concerning the specific question that you asked me: I stand by the statement that I made today. I think you have before you the text negotiated with Parliament, which you find in the revised draft on the EEAS basic organisation. What I am doing is set out in that text. I think that clears that up.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Tannock, you and a number of honourable Members, raised again national parliament involvement. This is something that I think is really interesting. The structures that I am planning to set up in the EEAS will cover relations with the European Parliament but also need to take on board relations with national parliaments. I should mention the famous day when I was travelling between Moscow, Kiev, Spain and Brussels – but was not unfortunately in Palma, Majorca at the same time. One of the reasons I was in Spain was to meet with the Chairs of all the Foreign Affairs Committees from each Member State. I will be doing the same thing again in the autumn, thanks to the Belgian Presidency, who are bringing them all together. I am very keen to work with national parliaments. We just need to make sure that we have a proper way of doing that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also recognise that there should be opportunities for different people to come into the service. I appointed Mr Vygaudas Ušackas as head of our delegation in Afghanistan; he was also a politician, a foreign minister and a diplomat. There are examples already. I can see where one is able to use the requirements of the treaty but recognise the additional skills that we can bring in, within what the treaty allows us to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Hautala, thank you for your support. I will work very closely with the Subcommittee on Human Rights and, as you know, I am reviewing how best we can achieve our human rights objectives. Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Vigenin, Mr Piotrowski, Mr Poręba and others all raised the very important issue of geographical balance. I do not know what else to say, other than you have my full commitment to it and within the review, you will be able to see if I have done it.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is absolutely clear to me is that we are going to appoint on merit. I have asked people to send me the brightest and the best. Because I am beginning to hold the interviews, I can tell you that is actually happening. I can tell you that they are coming from different parts of the European Union. So you will, I hope, see very quickly that I will do as much as I can for geographical balance and gender balance in this first tranche of appointees, in the next tranche, which we will be moving forward with in September, and within the central structures. For gender balance, we need to do more to encourage people to apply for the positions, to get women to come forward. When they do, they are truly excellent but we need more of them. So, if you can do more to encourage people, particularly women, please do so. We will come back to geographical balance in the review. You will be able to judge it properly at that point, but my commitment is absolute on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards being able to increase the capacity of what we do on the ground, Mr Danjean, there are recent incidents which demonstrate that. You will know that I am about to go on a series of visits over the next few weeks, including back to the Middle East. We have been looking at whether the EU should do more to support the openings of the crossings in Gaza, and I will visit Gaza again. You also know, of course, that we have been engaged in Kyrgyzstan and there will be a debate on that later. There are many instances where it is very important to make sure that we are able to support the people and support the opportunities for my colleague Kristalina Georgieva to get aid in.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that I have answered all the big questions that came out of the debate. Can I end, as I began earlier, by saying thank you so much to all of those who have engaged in this debate: the rapporteurs in particular, you, Mr President, but also individual honourable Members who have taken time to talk with me. I am extremely grateful and I believe that what we are setting in train now is something that this House can be truly proud of.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am first going to thank all the Members who have spoken in the debate for the support they have given to Mr Brok, Mr Gualtieri and I, and which has enabled us to achieve a result from these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I simply wish to say that I do not understand how certain individuals can argue that nation states should have sole competence in foreign policy matters. Good grief! What century are they living in? As if terrorism stopped at the borders of Member States, of nations! The same goes for climate change: how can climate change issues be addressed if only nation states, and not Europe, can discuss them? And the same goes for migration and migratory flows.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I sometimes have the impression that quite a few Members who are somewhat sceptical about this service are still living in the 19th century, when nation states decided everything: the balance of power between nations in Europe. We are now living in a different world, Mr President, a multipolar world in which Europe must have its say or else these issues will not be discussed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is a second aspect which surprises me somewhat. I hear people say that this is going to cost the taxpayer money. Quite the contrary, Mr President; this External Action Service is going to save money, because it will provide several EU Member States with the opportunity to reduce their consular services in many countries across the globe. It is therefore a means of saving money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, thirdly, I think that this is a new beginning. The External Action Service is the diplomatic service we need to implement EU external policy. I have always believed that we need to have a diplomatic service before we can have an EU external policy. With 27 different voices, we will get nowhere without this service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also know that the next stage will be to carry out more work on European defence. Indeed, something would be missing if we had a European diplomatic service but no European defence service. Therefore, Baroness Ashton, we already know what the next task is for the EU institutions. We must ensure that we have a real European defence service in the future.</p>

There is no other area in which Europe is so united, but this is where we have been weakest to date. The people want it, but the elite in the capital cities do not.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree with Mr Verhofstadt that the issue now is not the removal of sovereignty, but that we are to pool sovereignty, claiming it back for our citizens, so that we can continue to exist in this world. This, and nothing else, is the point and the EEAS will make a significant contribution here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, thank you for the statements you have made. I assume that these will also be communicated to Parliament, that they will be applied accordingly, and that the agreement to publish these in the Official Journal of the European Union will be honoured. No doubt we shall have to discuss these formalities in further detail, but now that you have made this contribution, we can start work on implementation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would emphasise once again that what we have outlined with regard to the fair distribution of positions – including in respect of the participation of Commission officials – also applies to the most senior positions, and that the positions of the Secretary General and Vice Secretary Generals should not be filled solely from the Council’s side. I would like to put this on record. In addition, we have also expressed some of the principles contained in the legislative resolution before you, what we wish to develop further in the Statute and so on, and where we have some proposals that go further than the present agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to advise Lady Ashton that the large package of papers on Mrs Gräßle’s desk should not be seen as a threat, but rather as evidence of the growing interest of the Committee on Budgetary Control in her service, so that preparations can already be made.</p>

We need to ensure the implementation is pursued in accordance with the spirit and letter of the agreement. There remain elements of the proposal that could give rise to different interpretations.

The committee which I chair, given the evident and sensitive institutional implications resulting from the creation of the new Service, has followed the preparation of the text of the agreement extremely closely since the very beginning. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs not only participated in the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, under the very strict definition of cooperation laid down in Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, but it also selected both of the rapporteurs. I am certain that Parliament will approve the document by a large majority. There will be work to do in order to make the European External Action Service (EEAS) able to actually perform the role it has been given by the new treaty and by the enthusiasm of the rapporteurs. The Service is not only a way to increase the European Union’s presence in various nations throughout the world; it also has a very important symbolic value, which is to express the unity of the 27 Member States. It is a natural consequence of the recognition of the EU’s legal personality. It is an incredibly important step towards the goal to be reached. The more votes cast in its favour, the further that step will carry us. I hope it will be reinforced even further by the establishment of a European Diplomatic Academy, and I would like to nominate the prestigious European University Institute in Florence to develop it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">At this point, one of the most urgent tasks in the course of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon is setting up the new, single European External Action Service (EEAS). An efficient and strong European External Action Service needs to be designed with care and foresight, set up in a cost-effective manner, and operated in a predictable and transparent way. These criteria can only be met if the new organisation is set up through the effective teamwork of the European Commission, the Council, Parliament and the competent parliamentary committees, and if all significant details are coordinated efficiently. A major prerequisite for the creation and operation of the EEAS is the determination of the new organisation’s budget, of its sources of funding, and of the conditions required to obtain the necessary funding. The efficient operation of the new organisation will be determined by its structural transparency and simplicity, clear operational rules and human resource management issues.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The EEAS will be staffed from three sources: EU institutions, Member States, and, if necessary, host state experts.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Full equality of staff from EU institutions and those employed by Member States must be guaranteed throughout their service period.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is equally important that both selection principles and practices are based on transparent and uniform procedures and criteria for all three groups.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the European perspective of the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has played a major role in promoting stability, security, democracy and fundamental freedoms in the Western Balkans, which are now firmly anchored in the enlargement process. There are positive developments, which we can build on today. Accession negotiations with Croatia have stepped up a gear and are now entering a crucial phase. Comprehensive stabilisation and association agreements are being put in place and implemented across the region, and the political and economic reform process continues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Reforms, however, must be consolidated. The democratic foundations in some of the countries remain fragile. Political leaders bear a huge responsibility in this respect to overcome differences and steer their countries and the region towards better governance and away from the risk of destabilisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The two very well-grounded and valuable draft resolutions on the agenda today confirm this trend and show that the European Parliament remains a key supporter of the stabilisation and association process with the Western Balkans, leading the region to eventual membership.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to thank the European Parliament – and Mr Chountis, in particular – for the good and balanced report on Albania. I welcome the opportunity to discuss Albania with you today, at this key moment for the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully share Parliament’s view regarding the political situation in Albania. The lack of constructive political dialogue and the lack of a settlement of disagreements, following the June 2009 elections, between government and opposition are of concern. Both sides need to return to constructive political dialogue and find a solution based on respect for the Constitution and transparency. OSCE-ODIHR recommendations need to be fully addressed in view of the spring 2011 local elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ongoing political stalemate is hindering important reform steps, which are also necessary for the country’s progress on the European Union integration path.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate the constructive role of the two Parliament principles played in the mediation initiative for a solution to the stalemate and I welcome Parliament’s call for a cross-party consensus on key reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the positive side, as regards the visa dialogue, the country has made important progress. The Commission’s proposal of 27 May for short stay, visa-free travel reflects this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully agree with the view that more efforts are needed to ensure Albania’s justice system can deliver in an efficient and timely manner. Albania needs to rigorously implement legislation and action plans on anti-corruption and in relation to fighting organised crime and ensure sufficient investigative and judicial capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has made IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) financial support in the area of the judiciary and law enforcement one of its main priorities, allocating some EUR 55 million in the period 2007-2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the freedom and independence of media, more needs to be done. The legal framework needs to be completed. Transparency of media ownership will be tackled. Intimidation and influence on journalists are of concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">Further issues are the effective implementation of the public administration reform strategy and ensuring an independent, professional and meritocratic civil service. Also, more needs to be done to address domestic violence and trafficking of women and children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, let me turn to Kosovo. Kosovo remains a priority. I am particularly grateful to Mrs Lunacek for the excellent work she has done on this Kosovo resolution. Your support is crucial, especially now, on the eve of the issuing of the International Court of Justice opinion.</p>
      <p sl="en">European Union Member States have different views on Kosovo’s status. However, Member States are united in their engagement with Kosovo, and so is the Commission. The discussions on Mrs Lunacek’s resolution confirm that Parliament is equally committed in its support for Kosovo’s European perspective, as part of the region at large.</p>
      <p sl="en">I visited Kosovo twice this year. My second visit also included the north and I had useful exchanges with the local community, opened the new European Union Information Point, and visited the newly established European Union House. I confirmed my assurances of the European Union’s continued support to the local community and called for cooperation and dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are making good progress on the proposals made in our Kosovo communication of last October. The Council invited us to support Kosovo’s progress towards the European Union, in line with the European perspective of the region. The timing and scope of Kosovo’s progress is determined by Kosovo itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">We launched the Stabilisation and Association Process dialogue with Kosovo in January. A full cycle of sector meetings has been completed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also moving forward on visas. The Council agreed that Kosovo should progress with the perspective of eventual visa liberalisation, once all conditions are met. In this context, the Commission continues to work with the Kosovo authorities to ensure that all the requirements to launch a visa dialogue are met. Kosovo adopted a readmission law on 25 June.</p>
      <p sl="en">The services of Commissioner Malmström are verifying its European Union compatibility as we speak. Kosovo still needs to ensure that reintegration arrangements are adequate to cope with returnees in a satisfactory manner. We are in very close touch with Priština to provide guidance and support.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also moving ahead on trade. The Commission adopted its proposal to extend the existing autonomous trade preferences for Kosovo until 2015 back in February. The ball is now in your court.</p>
      <p sl="en">A comprehensive trade fact-finding mission is in Priština again, as we speak, to assess the possibility for the European Union and Kosovo to prepare for negotiations on a trade agreement. We see such an agreement as essential for fostering Kosovo’s socio-economic development, which the draft resolution rightly highlights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, for the first time this year, Kosovo will take part in IPA Cross-Border Cooperation (CBC) programmes with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Programmes with Montenegro will follow next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the year ahead will be an important phase for Albania, Kosovo and the region at large.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning Kosovo, whatever the International Court of Justice says, I trust the European Union will continue to actively engage with Kosovo to ensure it stays connected to developments in the rest of the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning Albania, I hope that the political picture, as well as pragmatic progress on the ground – for which those in power and those in opposition share the responsibility – will allow us to establish a clear path ahead in the opinion the Commission will present in the autumn.</p>
      <p sl="en">In both cases, I am glad to be able to count on the joint support of the European Parliament and the Commission in fostering the countries’ and the region’s efforts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Parliament has been supporting the fight for freedom in war-torn Kosovo for 20 years. I would remind you of our Sakharov Prize laureates Mr Rugova and Mr Demaçi. Parliament has been working for an independent Kosovo for the last six years, most recently in its 2007 resolution, which was then followed by the declaration of independence by the Republic of Kosovo in 2008. If one considers the developments in the two years since then, then it is possible to say that Kosovan democracy is a success story. Democratic principles are being consolidated and a large part of the Serbian minority – 6% of the population – is starting to be integrated into the structures of the new state with its provisions for the protection of minorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why we need to do all we can to prevent this country from becoming destabilised by external forces, such as plans to divide up the country. Anyone seeking to divide Kosovo would also be interfering with the unity of Serbia – I would just mention the Preševo Valley, the Sanjak of Novi Pazar and Vojvodina. Those who would question the unity of the country threaten the stability of Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Anyone attempting to install a criminal political structure or renegade zone in Northern Mitrovica is seeking to push Transnistria to the margins of Central Europe. That would be extremely dangerous. We want a democratic Kosovo, a free Kosovo as a democratic country based on the rule of law, not a rogue region; our aim is for this country to gain diplomatic recognition by all EU Member States as soon as possible and for EULEX to be extended to the entire territory immediately in relation to the effectiveness of freedom and democracy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to say a few words on the topic of Albania. Albania has made considerable progress on its path towards European integration. This is ultimately reflected in the report of Nikolaos Chountis, whom I would like to thank for this excellent report. However, much remains to be done. At this point, I would first like to mention the issue of strengthening democracy and the functioning of the legal state. Albania is wasting too much energy and too much precious time through the inability of government and opposition to reach a compromise and cooperate over the essential priorities. Among these priorities is the achievement of a consensus concerning the 2009 elections. It is necessary here for all political parties to assume responsibility, enter dialogue and implement the decision to set up a parliamentary investigative committee with the objective of drafting the required amendments to electoral law before the next local elections take place next year.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Consensus among the main political parties is also necessary in issues of economic reform. Only a little progress has been achieved so far, for example, in consolidating property rights, registering real estate, drawing up an inventory of government land holdings, legalising unauthorised buildings and so on. The share of the grey and black economies in the Albanian economy remains disproportionately high, as does the level of corruption, of course.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the other hand, considerable progress was achieved last year in fulfilling the conditions and criteria for achieving visa-free relations. I would therefore like to welcome the recent adoption of the Commission’s legislative proposal on relaxing the visa regime, and I hope that in the coming months, the other conditions will also be met, so that the Council and this Parliament can approve the introduction of a visa-free regime for Albanian citizens this year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Liberal Group of this Parliament believes that the Western Balkans are a part of Europe, but this is not always an easy message to relay to voters today. However, we consider the EU to be not only a common market but, most importantly, a community of values. The European Parliament, across the board, stands ready to work with Albania towards these values, but is this extended hand reciprocated? I hope so.</p>
      <p sl="de">In recent months, the Chairs of the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats in the European Parliament have made great efforts to solve the political crisis in Albania through visits and through working with their sister parties. But even these high-level efforts have proven unsuccessful. In May, we had the first Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting. Most of us in the European Parliament began this meeting with much goodwill but by the end, we were discouraged in equal measure by the way in which our counterparts from Albania used the time in Brussels for internal quarrels, damaging Albania’s image.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting underlined a few important things. The highly polarised political climate does not help the Albanian people to get closer to Europe. Democracy means more than the result of elections, putting people into power. It means responsible representation of citizens; not the winner takes all, but seeking constructive compromise between majority and minority participation. We should have talked about the more urgent topics, such as guaranteeing press freedom and a vibrant, independent civil society, as well as safeguarding the rights of minorities such as LGBT people, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities. We should have discussed the need to end corruption and to guarantee transparency, fighting poverty and organised crime, and all this according to due process and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="de">The concerns about the election results also need to be addressed transparently and solved in a consensual way before the next elections take place, so that Albanians can move up on the democratic and European ladder.</p>

      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank you, Commissioner, for your positive cooperation, and also for doing something you understood to be important, namely, travelling to Northern Kosovo, even spending a night there to make it clear to the population that you are right behind them. You made a speech at the university and opened EU offices there. I believe this was an important sign in making clear what the European Parliament stated in the past and reiterates now, namely, its support for an independent Kosovo on its way into the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are once again faced with a situation where Kosovo finds itself at a crossroads, particularly in relation to the members of all of Kosovo’s ethnic groups. In a few weeks, the International Court of Justice will decide and give its opinion on the position in relation to the declaration of independence made a little more than two years ago. I hope that this decision will provide a window of opportunity for placing regional cooperation on a new footing, but starting from the premise of Kosovo’s statehood and independence, making it clear that the common future for all states in the region – for Serbia, Kosovo and all the others – is as members of the European Union and that the problems that still exist will have to be resolved as they move in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">The wording of the resolution makes it clear: Kosovo’s future lies within the European Union. I am pleased that we have a majority in favour of calling on the five Member States who have not yet recognised Kosovo to do so soon and demanding that the Commission should start the process of visa liberalisation as soon as possible. It is important that the citizens of the country, in particular, the younger generations, should not be made to feel that they are living in an isolated state, while everyone in the surrounding regions will soon benefit from future changes. I believe this is the challenge. I hope that I will also receive a big majority in favour in tomorrow’s plenary sitting.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have also submitted a new amendment that expresses deep regret at the outbreak of violence in recent days and the hope that the matter will be investigated quickly and impartially and will not provide the basis for an escalation of emotions in the coming days and weeks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the international community’s hasty and inconsistent approach towards Kosovo – and I await the ICG ruling with great interest – over the past decade has created a problem that will cost hard-pressed European taxpayers a lot of money. Kosovo cannot join the EU because five EU Member States refuse to recognise its sovereignty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Corruption remains a huge problem in Kosovo, which is also a major transit centre for illegal narcotics and people trafficking. The economy is far too dependent on EU and Western aid, and there seems to be no easy way out of this impasse. Ten years ago, in a personal capacity, I advocated partition as an answer to the problem. This is a solution many Serbian politicians favour but one that few Western politicians would countenance for now.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group, the ECR, does, however, fully support Albanian EU accession once they satisfy all the Copenhagen criteria and, in particular, improve their poor record on fighting corruption and organised crime. There is also an urgent need to solve the boycott by the opposition Socialists of the Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speaking personally, I do find it hard to see how Albania can reconcile its full membership of the Organisation of the Islamic conference with future CFSP positions if it becomes a member of the European Union, although I am partially reassured by the fact that it is already a full member of NATO.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I wish to thank all my fellow Members from all the political groups, because I think that, together, we have managed to agree on what I would say is the right motion for a resolution on Albania’s progress towards accession.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thank you, Commissioner, for your comments. I feel satisfied that, on most counts, the Commission’s perception is in keeping with that of the European Parliament which, I hope, will vote tomorrow in favour of the resolution. I should like to add that, while debating the case of Albania and of Kosovo in general, and because we are debating the question of enlargement, I am convinced – and the motion defends this – that the prospects of the Western Balkans lie in their accession to the European Union which, under certain terms and conditions in an area which has suffered much, may safeguard stability and prosperity and friendly relations between peoples and states.</p>
      <p sl="el">What are these terms and conditions? That the procedure in general should respect international law, the UN Founding Charter and international agreements and conventions, given that a series of issues within this area touch on those I referred to. Secondly, progress towards accession on the part of Albania and other countries (in this particular case, Albania) may, under certain terms and conditions, also act as an incentive for addressing numerous problems which beset Albania from the point of view of democratic cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mapping out these problems was perhaps the easy part of the exercise. The hard part, as you identified Mr Füle and as other members have identified, is how to persuade, how to inspire the political powers of Albania and Albanian society to take action to resolve these problems. This is where we come up against difficulties; steps have been taken, there are still problems, laws have been passed, there are problems with their application (this level of bribery and corruption cannot go on) and, of course, there is the major political problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">My comment on this (we all know about the impasse) is this: I do not think that we can resolve it with excessive outside intervention, often perhaps with party political affiliations, unless the political powers themselves are persuaded (and this was where we focused all our efforts) that a solution to these problems would give them the opportunity to focus attention on the problems, on the criteria for progress towards their country’s accession.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we have received reports from the Committee of Nationwide Reconciliation in Albania, which actively combats blood feuds, that there are 750 children who are under virtual house arrest because of a customary law in the Kanun which has got completely out of control. The self-same non-governmental organisation (NGO) counted more than 30 vendetta killings last year. In contrast, the Albanian Government has reported considerably lower figures. Be that as it may, the democratic rule of law and Albania’s accession to the European Union in the longer term are by no means compatible with the cruel practice of blood revenge.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, that brings me to two questions which I should like to address to you. Is the Albanian Government making sufficient efforts to combat grotesque perversions of the Kanun? On the subject of grotesque perversions, I should add that another practice in evidence today is that of hiring hit men to allow blood feuds to rage on without bounds. My second question is: in what ways is the Commission assisting the Albanian authorities in effectively pushing back the tide of blood feuding? I am thinking, for example, of an educational programme, a back-up option which would not be without its difficulties. Thank you for your reply.</p>

Acts of violence against Hungarians have become almost daily practice. Hungarians are even afraid of contacting the police for fear of a repetition of the events seen in the case of the young men in Temerin. The use of their mother tongue is restricted and the public authorities do not provide services in the Hungarian language. Serbian authorities are now planning to act against the United Hungarian Youth Camp (Egyesült Magyar Ifjúsági Tábor) which has been organised annually for several years now, seeking to prohibit it.

The conditions for visa liberalisation have been met, as you have pointed out, and we are hopeful that this will take place this year. Naturally, there is still a great deal to be reformed. Mr Chountis has produced a good report, which indicates both the deficiencies and the areas of progress. The fight against corruption and crime must be pursued with all the resources available. The governing coalition of democrats and social democrats has clearly identified this goal. This is what we will judge them on.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately the political climate in the country is poisoned by the irresponsible antics of a small minority among the socialist opposition. I do not intend to speak for myself at this point, but will quote a number of well-regarded Albanian socialists, such as Mr Agolli, former President of the Parliament, Mr Belumbi, and the country’s President, Mr Maldani, all of whom reject the renewed boycott imposed by their representatives in the parliament. They say that Mr Rama’s actions are unrealistic, that the strategy is fruitless and that the Socialist Party cannot expect its 65 parliamentary representatives to do nothing forever. Mr Agolli also states that the repeated opening of the ballot boxes is unconstitutional. Another socialist, Mr Manani, has openly stated that the actions of his party leader, Mr Rama, are intended to overturn the Albanian constitution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Albania needs a fully operational parliament and a functioning opposition group within it that takes the task entrusted to it by the people seriously and that does not pervert the democratic system. The citizens of Albania have had enough of these disputes. They want their children to have a future, that law and order should be upheld in the country, that enterprises should be established there that will create jobs. They want their politicians to serve the people rather than following an incorrectly understood party line.</p>

Today’s discussion and tomorrow’s vote are very important and are a useful contribution to the process of stabilising Kosovo and the Western Balkans as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">If it is to honour the commitments it has made, Europe must work to ensure that three primary objectives are fully met in Kosovo: a stronger and more complete integration of the Albanian and Serbian communities, full implementation of the rule of law and the strengthening of Kosovo’s democratic institutions. Moreover, these are essential conditions if Kosovo is to move more decisively towards the European integration process.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, the European Union must be very demanding with itself and with the authorities in Kosovo, through its presence there, so that the democratisation process can move forward in the country and can embark on the road to European integration. We need to be aware that there are still many things to be done. The European Union must play an active role, which means also following the guidelines provided by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore believe that this much hoped for process – and I do hope that this motion is adopted by the European Parliament and that all of the groups come together in some way – has a very important role, which I believe is negotiation, dialogue and opening an honest relationship between Serbia and Kosovo for two reasons: to stabilise the relationship between the two countries and to prepare the entire region in the best possible way for a European future; and we hope that this will happen in the not too distant future.</p>

That is something which is very important to me, but I hope that the Albanian authorities – that is, the opposition and the government – understand that they have to stop being perpetually at loggerheads, because they have much to gain from EU membership. Here, I am echoing the words of Mrs Pack. The citizens of Albania stand to reap major benefits from freedom of the press, the equal treatment of women and an improvement in the status of gays and lesbians and of the disabled.

What was ultimately imposed was a partition.</p>
      <p sl="el">I think it is a good thing that we tell the truth.

We must not rely on the fact that states are unable to defend their sovereignty in order to create small, independent entities.

This involves not only cooperating with the International Court of Justice – something that is quite justified – but also suddenly promoting regional integration and seeking to resolve bilateral disputes outside EU territory.</p>
      <p sl="de">The expansion of the Copenhagen criteria may seem praiseworthy at first, but the same principles would also have to apply to Turkey and would certainly result in an immediate halting of negotiations. However, the recognition of Kosovo is obviously intended as a kind of acid test for Serbia. Some people would like the European Union to take on the role of the guardian of the Kosovar Albanians without taking account of the legitimate interests of Serbia. The declaration of independence by the Kosovar Albanians is, however, generally known to be clearly in breach of international law. As Mr Deva has already pointed out, it infringes UN Resolution 1244.</p>
      <p sl="de">Apparently, it is part of EU policy to legitimise this breach of international law, despite the fact that five EU Member States refuse to recognise the independence of Kosovo on good grounds.</p>
      <p sl="de">Brussels is constantly emphasising that it does not get involved in internal affairs. If that is the case, then we cannot dictate to the Serbs on the issue of the recognition of Kosovo.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We all know that the Western Balkans needs a European perspective. I am pleased that the two reports we have debated, as well as the resolution, confirm this perspective, and also that the Belgian Presidency has included the process of continuing EU expansion among its priorities.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The most important thing for Albania will be to secure the maintenance of a stable democratic political environment within the country. The resolution rightly applauds the progress achieved by Albania in many areas last year, and particularly in fulfilling the technical criteria for implementing a visa-free regime. However, without properly functioning democratic institutions and dialogue within such institutions, it will be difficult to secure further progress towards the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">All thorny political issues, including – and indeed particularly – those that have persisted since last year’s parliamentary elections, can and must be resolved only under the terms of the constitution and through respect for law in the country. All Albanian politicians should keep this in mind.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Three sentences on Kosovo. For Kosovo, the European process has already begun, but it will clearly take a very long time.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the situation in Kosovo is still unsatisfactory, not just because of the internal problems, with regard to which Mrs Lunacek provided an excellent report. It is essential that we should finally enter into a dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, and that Bosnia and Herzegovina should also be included. This should take the decision or opinion of the International Court of Justice as its starting point. We are deluding ourselves if we believe it possible to take the retrograde step of dissolving independence; instead, we need to take a step forward so that both countries, Kosovo and Serbia, can join the European Union, perhaps even doing so hand-in-hand. That must be our goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to Albania, relations between the government and opposition are strained and we must seek a solution. I regret to say that Mrs Pack, who is usually very balanced in her arguments, has become a mouthpiece for the government. I think this is a pity. The point at issue here is not to get involved in internal political disputes, nor is it to make speeches that may suit the Albanian parliament even though they will not be heard there, and I do not intend criticising the government at this point to balance things out. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament want to see a solution. We believe both parties, government and opposition, should adhere to what they agreed, namely the setting up of a committee of inquiry, and that they should both seek a solution for the future, in particular, in relation to the question of the elections and the legitimacy of the elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">My hope is that we will finally have a situation in Albania where elections are not disputed, but are accepted by both sides, government and opposition alike. That is what is needed. This cannot be achieved through one-sided party politics, but requires a shared solution from the government and opposition. This is something the European Parliament should support.</p>

Our understanding from this picture is that some of the old problems persist, but there are also new ones. This is a credit to both authors.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We must take into account that both Kosovo and, to an even greater extent in my view, Albania, are societies of great contrasts. Our efforts must be focused on helping them overcome these contrasts. This view can be easily understood throughout almost the entire text of the motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We can see that Albania is enjoying impressive economic growth while, at the same time, there is shocking poverty in many regions. It has adopted numerous laws, but their enforcement is poor. There is diversity in the media sector, while the media are subject to political pressure. The proper implementation of reforms in Albanian society might not take place if the well-known conflict between the two main political groups continues.</p>

      <p sl="it">I believe this is the case with Albania, which, as the report we are debating highlights, falls short of Member State standards in a number of areas. In particular, I would like to emphasise the problems connected with the large informal economy. Convergence Objective areas receive the lion’s share of the funds granted by the European Union, and considering that those areas are determined on the basis of GNP, just imagine the distortions there will be, to the detriment of countries which are active in combating tax evasion, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, visa liberalisation will mean the arrival of a new workforce in Europe, and in view of the current economic situation and unemployment rates, the impact would definitely not be positive.</p>

      <p sl="el">We need to be extremely careful in this endeavour. Kosovo is a very complicated issue. There is no room for short cuts. The reality is that the independence of Kosovo has been recognised by 69 countries and Taiwan since 2008, which is a much smaller number than many expected. Five Member States have not recognised it. At the same time, many consider that the opinion of the International Court on the legality of the declaration of independence will be largely challengeable and unclear. The security situation in Northern Mitrovica is again causing serious concerns.</p>
      <p sl="el">In this environment, I consider that the European Union risks not achieving the noble objectives that we all endorse if it follows a monolithic, one-dimensional policy. I therefore believe that it would be expedient if we were to encourage Priština and Belgrade to make a new attempt at talks, primarily and mainly on issues which are having a negative effect on their daily life and communications, such as local government, customs, education, energy, religion and culture.</p>
      <p sl="el">As far as Albania is concerned, Albania missed the first wave of liberalisation of visas in the Western Balkans and, because of the political crisis, it risks missing a second opportunity. I trust that the political leadership in Albania, especially the socialist party and its president, will demonstrate the necessary gravitas and responsibility in resolving the issue as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, despite the fact that we have a joint debate today, Albania and Kosovo are very different. What unites them is the European perspective, given and reconfirmed on a number of occasions. Kosovo is struggling to create state institutions that function well, while its independence is not recognised by five of the EU Member States. We cannot exert pressure on these countries to revise their decision, but what we should expect is to work together to produce an approach that would allow Kosovo to move irreversibly towards EU membership. The first important successful step should be visa dialogue and the beginning of talks on the stabilisation and association agreement, whatever we may call it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding Albania, the first and most urgent action needed is to find a solution to the lasting political crisis, which has the capacity to block the country’s EU integration process. In this respect, if we are serious about our support for Albania, it is our joint responsibility to facilitate an agreement between government and opposition. I have to express a certain disappointment in our fellow Members from the European People’s Party, where either they are not consistent enough or their political influence over the ruling party in Tirana and its leader, Mr Berisha, was simply too limited. However, I still hope that the two biggest European political families will resume their joint efforts with more success after the summer break.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the resolution on Albania contains some rather bitter pills, but this is surely entirely correct. It is quite clear that Albania needs an extensive and radical moral shake-up. Of course, we must not forget Albania’s history. I visited Albania more than 40 years ago. At that time, Enver Hoxha was dictator of his people. It was a terribly cruel dictatorship: terror, oppression and corruption, no judicial system, no freedom of the press, no freedom of opinion at all. Forty years ago, Swedish students – and not only Swedish students and intellectuals – considered Albania to be an archetypal country. It was at that time that Albania included atheism in its constitution.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I do not believe that it has been particularly easy for Sali Berisha to succeed in building this country up. That is something that we also need to have the courage to acknowledge from time to time. In my view, what is needed in a country that has been demolished and torn apart, in terms of its values, is for it to have a foundation of firm values. It is my inner hope that the Commission will focus on Albania acquiring a firm set of values, because it is only then, I believe, that it will succeed in tackling the horrific problems that it has with human trafficking and slavery. There is no greater shame for a country than that. We can talk as much as we like about economic growth and other things, but while people are being sold and treated like commodities, this is a source of shame that the Commission must make every possible effort to root out.</p>

I urge the majority to negotiate closely with the Opposition and to welcome the permanent support of the two main political groups in the Parliament in order to reach a political solution – a positive one for the country – to ensure that Albania has a stable outcome from this crisis and to guarantee that in all future elections, the democratic will of the Albanian citizens will be fully respected, while ensuring full and uninterrupted parliamentary activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the end, Prime Minister Berisha, instead of trying to pronounce my name correctly in the Albanian Parliament, you must realise that European integration is at stake. The free-visa regime might be only the first step but the Copenhagen criteria are the prerequisite.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think the report on Kosovo is very good but what I want to talk about is that the broad thrust of European policy towards the Western Balkans has long been the establishment of democracy and the promotion of stability. There are cases where the two do not coincide, where stability is actually the enemy of democracy because the status quo, though oppressive, guarantees stability in the short-term.</p>
      <p sl="en">For a long time, this was the case with Yugoslavia in general, and Kosovo in particular. There was a general assumption that, even while Yugoslavia was far from being a democracy, it was best to overlook the flaws because the alternatives were worse. With Kosovo, the opposite proved to be true. The treatment of the Albanian population by the Serbian authorities became intolerable, and an uprising followed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The outcome was limited Western intervention, then the reluctant acceptance of the proposition that the people of Kosovo would never again accept rule by Belgrade. If Serbia were to reassert its power over Kosovo, the result would be more stability, and independent status followed. But that can only be a first step. Serbia has still to accept the loss of territory, which is painful. Kosovo has itself begun the process of constructing democracy, but this will take time to mature, which is hardly surprising given the traumatic experience of its population, but neither democracy nor stability is helped by the refusal to recognise the independence of Kosovo. Recognition has to be the way forward.</p>

      <p sl="el">The objective of the European Parliament report should be to send out a positive message about Kosovo’s European prospects and, at the same time, to clearly reflect the situation in the European Union on the core issue of the regime.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today, there are five Member States which have not recognised the independence of Kosovo. Of course, we all agree that there is no turning back the clock and a commonly acceptable solution needs to be found quickly. Our objective, therefore, was to find a meeting of minds, common ground. We found this common ground in the decision on EULEX, which stipulated that the mission would be neutral on the question of the regime. I cannot therefore but disagree with the two core ideas in the Lunacek report: Firstly, that the Member States which do not recognise the unilateral independence of Kosovo should accept what the majority considers to be a fait accompli and, secondly, that only Serbia should make concessions.</p>
      <p sl="el">In order to find the compromises required by reason of their geography and common European future, all sides should be constructive. Furthermore, we continue to be firmly convinced that European integration also requires agreed, not unilateral, decisions in the case of the Western Balkans.</p>

It is very important for Albanians and most important for Albania’s young people to be able to travel and feel that Europe is closer to them. Tangible progress is being made in Albania in the battle against corruption. However, a great deal, of course, still needs to be done. Measures must be stepped up against organised crime and actions improved against money laundering, human and drugs trafficking. It is important that more far-reaching legal and administrative reforms are carried out and that the rule of law is enhanced.</p>
      <p sl="bg">As regards Kosovo, it must be given a road map by the European Union for introducing the visa-free regime. In addition to all the benefits, I think that it will also ease interethnic tension. It will give a signal that the European Union is an achievable prospect for Kosovo.</p>

This also involves, of course, protecting the rights of all national minorities, including their cultural heritage. Violence is unacceptable.

That is to say, the opportunity will be lost if we do not recognise that the international rule of law must prevail, and that international law is not a branch of statistics but that it is very precise and not based on majorities, percentages, or the number of Member States that do or do not recognise a state, and that it sets out very specific criteria.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to make a couple of reflections on a very good debate based on very good resolutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, referring to Mr Tőkés, towards the end of the discussion, we are talking about the enlargement process in general, so I think it is useful to say that what we need for that enlargement process is to deliver candidates who are a hundred percent ready to assume all the responsibilities of being a member of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need two things. We need more rigorous attention given to conditionality and, at the same time, a political steering of this process, because enlargement is not just a technical process. It is also a political process and yes, Mr Tőkés, I will make sure that not only Member States are part of the political steering, but also aspirant and candidate countries. They have a lot to say in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree with Mr Svensson that, while looking at ticking the boxes of the number of resolutions passed and the number of institutions established, we should not lose sight of the bigger picture. That bigger picture is that we are doing all that to establish a firmer foundation of our values. None of the legislation and none of the new institutions will solve the issues we are focusing on in today’s discussions, but this firm foundation of our values will be an appropriate basis for solving and addressing these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">This leads me to another point. Let me use this opportunity to show my appreciation once again for the initiative by the honourable Members, Mr Daul and Mr Schulz. I think it was unique and unprecedented and the European Council took careful note of it. I hope very much that this Parliament, through this kind of initiative, will continue to offer to be the place where we could help those who are not able, for whatever reason, to solve their domestic issues. I call on you to keep the consensus on these issues because this is a prerequisite for you to play this very important and very useful role.</p>
      <p sl="en">I heard the calls from Mr Ilchev that the parties should again sit behind the negotiating table. I think they should. We have not been able to solve the issues. There is political stalemate in Albania. I would like it very much if the Albanian political parties, instead of looking back to the past, were to look to the future and make sure – as Mr Swoboda quite rightly said – that in the next elections, we do not again face the same situation, where those who have lost question the results.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the issue of vendetta – the blood feuds – this is a phenomenon which the Commission is following very closely. It is a phenomenon which makes me very concerned, particularly about the effects on families and especially on children. It is true that this phenomenon has decreased over recent years but a coordinated strategy dealing with blood feuds – including crimes committed under customary law – remains to be adopted. I will send you more detailed information about what the Commission is doing in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Kacin referred to the violent shooting of Mr Miletić and others referred to the recent violent incident in Mitrovica. The Member States have condemned the violence and have made it absolutely clear that, in order to achieve the objectives in Kosovo, the violence cannot be tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Baroness Ashton, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, was in discussion with the leaders both in Belgrade and Priština to convey a strong message about showing restraint at this important time as we approach the ICJ opinion on Kosovo.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, in the background papers for our debates, there is often an unseen link between the tendentious analysis of the situation, the feelings of the authors and the vague recommendations. I would like to state some facts: first, the independence of Kosovo was prepared and declared in breach of international law. The basis in this case is UN Security Council Resolution No 1244, according to which Kosovo remains part of Serbia. The secession of Kosovo from Serbia results from the murky practices of secret diplomacy, based on a policy of double standards. Secondly, the creation of what are, in essence, two ethnically pure Albanian states alongside each other is only a temporary prelude to the creation of a greater Albania. The linking up of Kosovo and Albania was always the aim of the Kosovo separatists. Thirdly, the independence of Kosovo has been recognised by only a few European Union countries; mainly those that bear the most guilt for the illegal bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999. Fourthly, so-called independent Kosovo is completely dependent. An artificial, non-historical state has been created, which is not viable economically, politically or militarily. It exists today only thanks to foreign donations and international criminal activities. The expansion of the EU to include certain Balkan states only provides a cover for the attempt of the Kosovan ‘godfathers’ to secure subsidies from EU funds for Priština. No matter how well we – the European Parliament, the Union as a whole and Europe generally – manage to resolve the Kosovo problem, the basic fact remains unchanged: the secession of Kosovo was in breach of international law.</p>

    <intervention id="3-425" speaker_id="39725" name="Iuliu Winkler" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="ro">Today’s debate reconfirms the European Parliament’s position that regional stability in the Western Balkans and providing a definite prospect of integration to all the countries in this region are EU priorities. I firmly believe that the future of the Western Balkan states lies in the EU. However, the duration of the integration process depends on how they are going to tackle the problems inherited from the past as they look ahead to a common European future.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As regards Kosovo, while acknowledging the positive developments which have been made in the two years since the declaration of independence, it still must be said that 2010 is crucial for stepping up democratic reforms, kick-starting economic activity, consolidating and decentralising administration, with the aim of ensuring complete respect for the rights of ethnic minority communities. The extent to which a future in the EU becomes a reality for Kosovo depends, to a large degree, on the efforts the government and new administration make in establishing democracy, as well as in the stabilisation and association process.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Improving regional cooperation is instrumental in making the EU’s enlargement policy in the Western Balkans become effective. These efforts will only be successful if they enjoy the EU’s broad support, which also means through all Member States acknowledging the new geopolitical realities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your invitation to this debate, which I think is an extremely important one. It is fortunate that we are able to hold it on the risks, safety and regulation of offshore oil operations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After seeing the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, we obviously cannot remain indifferent when we think about the victims and the extremely serious damage – probably irreparable in some cases – caused to the environment in that region, and we now have a duty to learn every possible lesson from what has happened, in order to prevent a similar disaster from occurring in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that the situation in Europe is not the same. We already have stricter operating conditions. Our exploration and extraction takes place nearer to coasts and at much shallower depths than those at which the Gulf of Mexico accident occurred. Nevertheless, we can never be too careful, as the saying goes, and we are right to consider a more preventative policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to pay tribute to the dynamic and proactive approach of the Commission, which, as long ago as 11 May, took the initiative of consulting and interviewing industrialists and which will resume its consultations on 14 July – Commissioner Oettinger will explain this to you in more detail and better than I. I am told that a debate was already held in your Chamber on 18 May.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council has also examined the issue, and we held an initial debate with the Commission at our last Energy Council Meeting on 31 May. The initial informal contacts made with the Commission suggest that we could revisit the issue at the informal Council meeting in September, to ensure that pressure continues to be exerted in this area. We also addressed these issues at the various bilateral meetings held as recently as 28 June with the OPEC countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue now is to determine whether further legislation is needed in this area, in which there already exist several important regulations on the safe operation of platforms, the safety of workers, and so on. We already have, of course, the European Maritime Safety Agency and the Civil Protection Mechanism. Do we need anything else? Do we need to strengthen these regulations further? This is the question which we will have to ask ourselves once the Commission has finished its analysis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I said, the Commissioner – and, once again, he will explain matters to you better than I can – is continuing to analyse the legislation and consult Member States and industrialists. On behalf of the Council, I would simply ask that the Commission extend its range of contacts and approach other types of expert, in universities, for example, so that as many points of view as possible are expressed around the table. The idea is that, with the help of this comprehensive analysis – which I hope will be completed soon – we can envisage strengthening the set of EU regulations and legislation in this field, with a review of the regulation on the European Maritime Safety Agency being the first stage in this process. Furthermore, we will have to examine the issue not only of which platforms are currently in operation, but also of which ones are no longer in use and will eventually have to be decommissioned. Once again, this entails major risks and potential environmental risks and naturally raises the issue of financial liability and the technical arrangements for this decommissioning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are all the issues the Council would like us to be able to debate. I should like to assure you, in any case, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that the Belgian Presidency intends to ensure that this issue is rigorously monitored, and that it will continue to receive our attention.</p>

    <intervention id="3-431" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Minister Magnette, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time today the House has discussed this issue and the possible risks associated with oil exploration and oil extraction off the coast of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have not been idle in recent weeks. On the basis of a comprehensive hearing involving the oil companies active under European competence, we drew up an extensive catalogue of questions that dealt with all the safety issues. We received the replies in the last few days and we have also evaluated the results. Next week, we have another hearing with all 17 or 18 companies which extract oil under European competence and we shall address the weaknesses there. I have suggested an informal meeting in the next few days with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, or rather with their coordinators, to inform them of the initial results associated with these replies.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, the Commission services have begun examining existing legislation. They are considering risk management, prevention, damage limitation and follow-up measures. It is already apparent that the answers are not absolutely clear, and are therefore unsatisfactory. I am working together closely with my colleagues, Mrs Damanaki, Mrs Georgieva and Mr Potočnik, in their respective spheres of competence. What we want is a comprehensive position from the Commission with regard to all the issues, from prevention and reaction to questions of liability.</p>
      <p sl="de">The prime concern is safety, and safety must come first. I believe that safety always comes before financial considerations. You could also say that safety is absolutely non-negotiable. When it comes to operational and occupational safety, we already have standards that guarantee a high degree of prevention. In the environmental area, the question of liability follows the principle that the polluter pays. Yet here too, it is already possible to produce an interim result. My aim is to clarify the European legal framework and to bring it to a new level. For this reason, I am also holding a meeting on 14 July that is to be attended by the national supervisory and regulatory bodies, the ministries and specialist authorities. I intend discussing with them the options and necessary actions to ensure that European standards are brought to the highest possible level and apply uniformly across the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, I wish to address five central points where I believe action is necessary, from prevention and remedial measures to liability.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, new drilling activity. As you know, responsibility for approving and examining applications for new drilling rigs and new drilling opportunities lies with our Member States. My clear advice to the Member States today is that I would not recommend licensing any new drilling – namely extreme drilling – but suggest that such activities be shelved. This may constitute a de facto moratorium. It should be accepted. While the consequences are under detailed discussion, it is reasonable to expect that all those involved, namely the oil companies, accept that new licences are hard to justify while the debate is still in progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our governments will and must ensure that the industry adheres to the highest standards in terms of safety and prevention. This is a principle that is not negotiable in view of the extreme climatic and geophysical conditions that apply.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second issue is the level of prevention and a strengthening of controls. We must examine all emergency plans on the basis of best practice, where we can learn from others; approval procedures must include the ability to respond in critical situations. We must also consider the financial background, so that responsibility for damage, i.e. the principle that the polluter pays, does not just exist in theory, but can also be pursued in practice. In addition to the liability of the originator, whether culpable or not, we should also examine whether additional insurance solutions, mandatory insurance solutions or even preliminary solutions make sense, as appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I feel the usual division of labour between the national authorities and their EU counterparts is not really satisfactory. We need a new model, greater synergy and more efficient cooperation, perhaps even a system for auditing the auditors. In other words, in a few weeks’ time, I would like to propose to Parliament and to the Member States that national competence for controlling and auditing should remain in place, but that the verification of auditors and a common auditing standard should be established in addition at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Next, we should look at a stress test for existing legal provisions. My intention is that Europe should have the highest safety standards and legal provisions in worldwide terms. This must be accepted because the damage that could occur in the event of an accident, including the economic damage, far outweighs the cost of avoiding accidents.</p>
      <p sl="de">We then need to check whether the existing European Maritime Safety Agency, which has competence for shipping, also has the competences to inspect drilling rigs and platforms. We have competences in this field, but the issue is, I believe, how we are to extend these competences.</p>
      <p sl="de">We then need to look at the Member States, as well as Norway, the Mediterranean region, the Maghreb zone and, in our vicinity, Nigeria. I wish to stimulate worldwide debate that will make it impossible for similar environmental catastrophes to occur in this form in any region of the world, firstly, in the maritime regions accessible to us but, in future, worldwide too.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must give priority to thoroughness rather than haste. This is an extremely important issue and work is in progress on the legal, economic and technical fronts. Please give us another few weeks to produce a comprehensive plan of action that we can recommend to the Member States, the Energy Council, other European Councils and Parliament. I am counting on your expertise, interest and cooperation.</p>

    <intervention id="3-432" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am in full agreement with the statement of my colleague, Mr Oettinger. Let me add just a few points.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first remind you of an obvious fact which, however, has not been mentioned sufficiently these last few days. This dramatic accident happened at sea. What does that mean? Its consequences are multiple. Beyond the loss of lives, we had an unprecedented ecological disaster that affects the marine and coastal ecosystems, an economic and social catastrophe for tourism, for the fishing industry, as well as many other maritime and coastal activities. As Commissioner Oettinger said before me, it is a moment for us to analyse existing legislation, in order to check if it provides complete coverage for risk management and prevention. We also have to demand guarantees from oil companies, for full safety, referring to all their activities. This is very important. Full safety in all their activities and full application of the polluter pays principle.</p>
      <p sl="en">Referring especially to my portfolio, if we have a situation where European fisheries become directly affected by a spill, I, as the Commissioner in charge, will take the necessary steps to mitigate the impact on fishermen and their communities as far as possible and adequate.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I think that now is, above all, the moment to question ourselves on our addiction to oil and to look forward towards better management of the oceans and seas. This dependence on oil clearly comes at a price, which a large part of the population and of maritime stakeholders is no longer willing to pay. I am well informed about this. So we have to understand that there is great potential for future energy from the oceans. We need to put more emphasis on renewable ocean energy – not only offshore wind energy, this is obvious, but I am not only referring to this. I am referring also to sea energy, for example, energy coming from waves, tides, the exploitation of algae or thermal sea potential. This energy is cleaner and will help us to achieve our climate action targets and the diversification of energy sources. It also offers a huge potential for highly qualified new employment in maritime sectors and coastal regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe is the maritime continent par excellence and we should take the lead in the development of sustainable marine energy sources. We need the tools for a prevention policy as Mr Oettinger said but, at the same time, we need to allow balanced and sustainable exploitation of the marine sources. How can we achieve this?</p>
      <p sl="en">Integrated maritime special planning can give us this opportunity. It is the key instrument in reconciling conflicting interests in the issue of this space. It can anticipate future challenges and operational skills. Equally, our knowledge of the deep sea is dramatically poor and we have to understand this. Today, for example, nobody can say for sure whether the spill will reach European shores, which creates justified concerns for us. We clearly need to better understand the deep sea. This means that we need to increase our research activities and to develop our maritime surveillance capacities in terms of satellites and equipment in general and with regard to data gathering and modelling.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also seeing the need for international cooperation and understanding. So far, only the United States is directly affected but I think it is fair to say that this disaster is also a lesson in humility. We need to share experiences, best practice in governance and disaster response.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the integrated maritime policy of the European Union will help the Commission’s ongoing work and prepare the ground for a secured, balanced and sustainable use of the oceans.</p>

    <intervention id="3-433" speaker_id="28252" name="Richard Seeber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Magnette, Members of the Commission, firstly I would like to thank and congratulate Commissioner Oettinger for reacting so quickly and, above all, for contacting the responsible sectors and safety authorities. I believe that this is the only way we shall find a solution. However, I also believe that the all-embracing approach adopted by Commissioner Damanaki is also extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am against ad hoc legislation. However, catastrophes such as this suggest that the entire issue of energy should be examined. I believe we are all now aware that this dependence on fossil fuels has many associated risks and that when we consider the future of energy supply in Europe, we must always take these risks into account. That is why the vehement criticisms we sometimes make of renewable energy sources, whether the sustainability criteria for bio fuels or the negative visual impact of wind turbines on the natural landscape, must always be balanced against the fact that the alternatives are, in fact, the more dangerous, conventional energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I believe it is important, despite the differences between the USA and Europe, that we should carry out a thorough analysis of the situation and, as Commissioner Oettinger has said, that we should take a close look at specific aspects of the legal framework, because in Europe, we have a highly fragmented situation. This means that it can be very difficult for the individual to gain access to the law.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prevention and, above all, European cooperation are extremely important in the event of such a catastrophe. We must think this proposed solution of insurance or a fund through to its logical conclusion. I believe that this is the only way to offer the oil companies a certain level of security in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this disaster happened off the coast of the US, not the EU. It therefore affords us a real opportunity to learn some lessons and draw some conclusions. Mr Oettinger said that this is the second time we have discussed this issue. My committee has also held a major debate, and I am thankful to you that as soon as next week, together with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall learn the results of your analysis, enabling us to continue our work into the summer recess.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would support you on the imposition of a moratorium on extreme drilling in Europe. We need to wait until we have identified the problems. I would also support your call for European standardisation, stringent safety standards and a European supervisory authority. As you have said, what we need is a system for auditing the auditors. I like this idea a lot. We would be happy to work on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Damanaki, I liked what I heard from you: this disaster must spur us to change. The integrated maritime policy you have called for is a major project for the EU. I believe that harnessing the renewable energy of the sea, whether through deep-sea currents or other forms of retrieval that are yet to be invented, is a really key issue. I believe that the institutions, including the Council, have demonstrated a determination to prevent such a disaster in Europe, as has Parliament, and will be happy to cooperate with you in avoiding such an eventuality.</p>

    <intervention id="3-435" speaker_id="97076" name="Corinne Lepage" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, firstly, I should like to tell Mr Oettinger how struck I was by the difference between what he has just told us and what we have previously heard, and how happy I am to see Mrs Damanaki and Mr Potočnik, who are also interested in the subject, sitting beside him, because this shows the multifaceted nature of the problem facing us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is clearly no applicable EU text in existence today. We need to equip ourselves with a piece of EU legislation on this matter, perhaps by simply extending the scope of the legislation that already exists in other areas. I am thinking about Seveso II relating to hazards and about the directive on environmental liability and the remedying of damage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question of insurance and of a fund deserves to be examined, provided that this does not serve as an opportunity to reduce the liability of producers and operators. The ‘polluter pays’ principle must, of course, be applied. The moratorium is essential, but perhaps not only in extreme circumstances; we need a moratorium on new installations until we can be sure that we have the necessary technical resources to cap any leak. Once we have those resources, normal service can resume.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A final point on the post-oil era: it is absolutely essential, and we have here an opportunity to adopt a real cost-benefits approach on the basis of the actual costs incurred by oil exploitation. I think that, once we are able to assess the direct and indirect costs and benefits of the various energy sources, we will be well on the road to sustainable development.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I should like to thank the Commission – Commissioners Oettinger and Damanaki – for their contributions to this topic. We have indeed discussed this before, but what I am particularly pleased about is that the tone is different this time. In May this year, the tone was entirely along the lines of: you can sleep safely knowing everything is under control, the situation in Europe is not comparable to that in the Gulf of Mexico. We took issue with this tone, because, although the situation is not exactly comparable, there are nonetheless many oil platforms in the North Sea and we are drilling deeper and deeper in the North Sea in order to extract oil. That is a risk that we clearly have to be prepared for, and the Commission’s tone is now clearly different. The Commission is now talking about a moratorium, about supervising the supervisory authorities and about responsibility for good governance. That approach has received the support of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but let us now have immediate decisive action please. If we look at the European Maritime Safety Agency, for example, you said that you would look into expanding its mandate somewhat. You did not mention your colleague, Commissioner Kallas, although he, too, is already working on this. I have this to say to you: let us ensure that the Agency does not just look at the tankers, but the platforms as well. That is now possible and things are already under way. Let us regulate that. We need broader support for this approach.</p>

    <intervention id="3-437" speaker_id="28358" name="Konrad Szymański" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the responsibility of British Petroleum for the leak in the Gulf of Mexico is only part of the truth. The Department of Internal Affairs carried out an inspection of the installation two weeks before the disastrous leak. The United States market regulator approved the operation of the faulty installation 10 days before the accident.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite the increasingly strict and more complicated regulations governing offshore drilling, there was something on the government’s side which did not work. The accident in the Gulf of Mexico should not be a reason for closing similar installations around the world. A ban on offshore drilling in Europe or the US will have only one consequence – a significant increase in the transportation of crude oil in tankers, which will obviously cause damage to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to acknowledge the assistance given by Taiwan, which has sent one of the world’s largest oil-skimming vessels to the area. Today, the ship is cleaning the Gulf of crude oil very effectively. This often unacknowledged country has given another edifying example of responsibility for global affairs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, each day, we are given more information revealing the extent of the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the failure of the offshore platform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not forget, however, that other disasters of this type are occurring elsewhere. I am thinking in particular about what is happening at this very moment, and has been happening for a long time, in Nigeria. This is why, in addition to the moratorium on further drilling, I think we need to promote more rigorous rules – not just European rules, but international ones too – on the management of platforms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the case of the EU, I think that it needs to equip itself with the means to prevent this type of disaster, and I think that it is also clear that all this demands, as Mrs Damanaki said, a firm and resolute decision in favour of clean, renewable energy sources. The EU ought to set an example in this area.</p>

    <intervention id="3-439" speaker_id="28390" name="Pilar del Castillo Vera" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioners, Mr Magnette, there can be no doubt that the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico has raised awareness of these types of situations, while exposing the need to analyse them in depth and to take measures to prevent or counteract them.</p>
      <p sl="es">These things also occur in Europe. They have occurred. I am a national of a country, Spain, where not many years ago, we had a problem – in the north of the country – with spillages of this type due to problems with transportation, in this case, a problem with tankers.</p>
      <p sl="es">When we find ourselves faced with a situation of this type, the risk is to act emotively and without thinking all that much, and therefore without any balance in decision making, which may have undesirable consequences. I believe that what the Commissioners explained to us, the ten points that Commissioner Oettinger set out, is a very important and interesting approximation of the problem, and that it is along the right lines.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a need to act forcefully with regard to civil responsibility and partnership, arrive at joint positions with the International Maritime Organisation, harmonise the legislation of Member States better, etc., but this needs to be done in such a way that the actions we take do not have any undesirable consequences. What needs to be done therefore needs to be assessed very well, including economically, together with its impact.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the catastrophe at the Deepwater Horizon platform will remain probably as one of the biggest catastrophes in the 21st century in the history books of the world. It is about safety, security and prevention, and safety, security and prevention have a human face; all the industrial applications we use in any sector are human-designed, human-built and human-managed. Therefore, we have to make sure that industries throughout the sector and beyond the oil sector get the skills and knowledge they need to manage any consequences of any minor or bigger catastrophe in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have to learn a lesson to continue to face the long-term challenge of the post-oil age by diversifying our resources and technologies. For us, it must be crucial to rethink and support our strategic energy technology plan, including the deep sea technologies that were mentioned by Mrs Damanaki.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally colleagues, I have to say that this catastrophe, although it is not a natural catastrophe, has to be about solidarity and support. First, in order to re-establish nature, but then there needs to be solidarity and support for the employees of the company because the employees of the companies are victims – working elsewhere in the company. We have to go and ask for solidarity for the sector, within the sector, because we have seen that none of the sector’s players could solve the problem and we have to seek solidarity within Europe because BP is a European company; working people are there, European employees, and they have to have our solidarity to keep their working places for the future.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this Parliament keeps criticising the Commission and the Council, but I have to be honest and say that I am very impressed with the statements made by both the Council and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning first to the Commission. This is the Commission as I like to see it: powerful, ambitious and showing leadership. You have even used the word ‘moratorium’, which is music to our ears, but from your point of view, of course, that was an appeal to the Member States to hold back a little with new approvals. My question to the Council is: could you perhaps respond to that straight away?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Obviously, one important lesson of the oil disaster in Mexico is that we have to stop perpetually looking for fossil fuels in the most impossible places. As far as I am concerned, that is the most important lesson. What we need is a swifter transition to sustainable energy. I would therefore ask the Commissioners, when it comes to subsidies for coal in our Europe, for example, to show the level of determination and ambition which they expressed in their statements. That issue should keep you busy over the coming fortnight. Keep up the good work and keep toeing the right line.</p>

I think it is excellent and I do not mind telling you that Parliament will be keen to cooperate, particularly as regards the moratorium, the update and revision of the legislation, the supervision of the supervisory authorities, the revision and improvement of emergency plans, and the increase in transparency. An example of the kind of thing that Parliament’s role here might involve could be asking Member States to post all their inspection results on a website so that they are accessible to all.</p>

However, allow me to also give you a piece of advice. In September of this year, we are going to have a meeting of the OSPAR Convention. A ministerial statement will be issued on maritime safety and I think that you, Minister, should use the opportunity offered by this meeting to ensure that the convention contains adequate guarantees of an independent assessment of what actually happened and an independent and transparent assessment of the existing regulations. I think that you will be able to put in a great deal of work there.</p>

      <p sl="pl">All of us here are aware of the magnitude and enormity of the environmental disaster which has occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. Almost two months have already passed since our last debate on the safety of marine drilling platforms. In the meantime, there has also been a debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. For three months, millions of litres of crude oil have been flowing relentlessly into the Gulf, devastating the region’s entire ecosystem. The slick has already reached the coast of Florida, and is threatening Cuba and Mexico. Clearing up the results of this tragedy has also swallowed huge financial outlays. The oil company BP has announced that the costs of fighting the disastrous leak of crude oil into the Gulf have already reached over USD 3 billion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the light of this, I would like to express my support for proposals concerning the creation of a special fund and the need to insure against crude oil spills in European waters. I am of the opinion that oil companies, although they do minimise the risk, should also be ready to bear financial responsibility in the event of a catastrophe. Establishing a fund of this kind would offer a certain kind of protection and would be an expression of environmental and social responsibility for one’s own investments. I think it essential, too, that we introduce a uniform system of technical inspection of platforms in the territorial waters of the European Union and a regular and publicly available evaluation of their safety.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Damanaki and Mr Oettinger. Their words give us hope. Although the Gulf of Mexico is a long way away, the disaster may affect our animal life too, fish in particular. If the oil from the Gulf is driven into the open Atlantic, it could affect the spawning grounds of the European eel, for example, which was already threatened with extinction prior to the oil catastrophe.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not a natural event, but rather an unbelievable disaster triggered by human error. For this reason, we must do all we can to ensure something like this never happens again. We are responsible for the safety of European oil platforms. We need to put our laws to the test because European environmental liability provisions are not enforceable in the event of oil catastrophes on the high seas.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are over 400 oil platforms in the North Sea alone. In view of the fact that the European Union has 320 000 km of maritime coast, it is essential that we should move away from oil and towards a future based on renewable energies. I call on the Commission to propose concrete solutions and to act quickly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Magnette, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when catastrophes occur, there is an urgent need for clever solutions to ensure that such disasters never happen again. However, we should guard against over-dramatising the situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Oettinger, I have been extremely impressed with the way the Commission has dealt with this problem to date. I think it wise to analyse the problems and the facts of the case and then to identify solutions, rather than producing solutions before the circumstances have been fully investigated. This is very welcome. I believe that there is no alternative to this approach. After all, Europe also has 10 166 oil and gas extraction plants in operation, 80% of them offshore. This is an issue that must be taken seriously.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is also true that the problem just described has arisen in the US and that we have had no problems of this kind here in recent decades. This should not give us cause for complacency, but requires us to think carefully about what needs to be changed and where the changes are required. Above all, we should avoid following the principle of, ‘The catastrophe happened over there – the main thing over here is that we should make some changes and issue new recommendations’. The situation should not be played up or down, but rather we need a serious, thorough approach. I believe that the approach we are taking is completely correct and reasonable.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also very grateful to know that we, both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, will receive more detailed information next week about further developments. I believe that the Commission should continue with this considered, rational and serious minded approach. While it should not be goaded into hasty action, nor should it contribute to a trivialising of this issue.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, thank you Commissioners, as Commissioner Damanaki said, the oil slick does indeed threaten the Atlantic as a whole and threatens to reach our shores. I was delighted that Commission Oettinger has now started thinking about the proposal which I and Mrs Lepage made here, in this House, during our previous debate on a moratorium. However, Commissioner, this moratorium should not be temporary. We need a permanent moratorium, as the United States have for most of their fields.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am also delighted that you are debating the question of environmental responsibility. We need a change of framework. We need to know who is responsible and who needs to pay for such accidents. Once you have started this debate, you should also look at the question of environmental responsibility in connection with drilling for natural gas and CCS under the sea.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the environmental disaster playing out in the Gulf of Mexico in recent weeks must serve as a warning for us all. If a similar event were to occur in a closed sea such as the Mediterranean, which boasts an inestimable level of biodiversity that is unique in the world, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this connection, last week, I tabled a written question highlighting the fact that offshore oil platforms are subject to a less binding civil liability regime than large industrial plants. This means that if a spill occurs, the oil company is only responsible if it was at fault or negligent and only in that case is it required to pay for the environmental damage caused.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of the 103 industrial accidents that occurred in 2008, 17 occurred on oil extraction platforms. Even though platform supervision and control are the responsibility of national authorities, a European initiative aimed at increasing the safety of extraction rigs would certainly send out an important signal. Placing Europe’s environmental heritage at risk could prove an irreparable mistake for all of us and, above all, for future generations. Therefore, I say greater security and better controls for the common good.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the demise of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform has caused the greatest oil disaster in our history. To date, hundreds of millions of litres of crude oil have poured into the Gulf of Mexico causing massive losses to sea life, as well as land animals. The global consequences for the ecosystem are disastrous.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU must make a constructive contribution to consolidated legal regulations for oil extraction so that oil companies cannot cut corners in relation to the quality of materials used or the safety measures they apply. Cost efficiency cannot be used as an argument in the face of possible threats to the health of people and wildlife caused by negligence. In addition, greater focus on renewable energies can provide an answer to increasing energy consumption worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="de">My message to the Commission is that we must bring about change in this area, moving away from fossil fuels and towards biogenic fuels. We need to reduce our existing dependency in this area.</p>

This information confirms that the Commission quickly took a series of steps after the catastrophe in the Gulf. The truth is, however, that the results of talks and the decisions made are still very much preliminary. Let us remember we are talking about safety and responsibility in the extraction of crude oil. Mistakes in this area cause gigantic losses in nature, as well as financial losses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, this should be a strong inducement to the European Union to introduce a temporary moratorium on new drilling. Until we are sure that extraction is going to be safe, we should be particularly cautious.</p>

      <p sl="it">Research on new energy sources is needed. However, putting the ecosystems of our land and our seas at risk must be countered by supervisory limits established by national and European authorities to avoid an unjust and aggressive oil prospecting and extraction business. Italy has just recently closed the regulatory gaps which meant that some platforms were able, in the past, to encroach on our most beautiful coasts. I would like to thank the Italian Minister for Equality, Stefania Prestagiacomo, for this, and I hope that all the national regulations will protect the well-being of our lands, their respective habitats and the quality of life of citizens who live in areas that may be subject to these activities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, since the Deepwater Horizon oil platform sank in the Gulf of Mexico, millions of litres of oil have been escaping into the sea on a daily basis.

      <p sl="ro">I, too, wish to thank the Commission for the statements which have been made.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There is no production method which is 100% safe. There is always a certain degree of risk. However, the question is how big a risk do companies take in each case. Production costs can be astronomical, depending on the area’s geological features, which can make a company take on large risks to make sure they achieve a profit. It costs us much less to increase production safety measures than to look for solutions after the event.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the legislation must be sufficiently stringent to prevent such accidents. We must also ensure that companies operating in European waters have the financial capacity to bear the costs of losses inflicted on the environment and society in a maximum risk scenario.</p>

During the present economic and financial crisis, there are relatively few opportunities for investing in the oil industry’s infrastructure.

    <intervention id="3-454" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate. Mrs Damanaki, my staff and I have noted your contributions and your constructive proposals and I shall be happy to return to these in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to comment specifically on four points. Firstly, while respecting the competences of our Member States, I would expressly advise them not to implement new approval procedures at present. I believe that a moratorium on processing applications for new drilling rigs and making the relevant decisions is a reasonable response at present and that for this reason, new projects can be put back to a later date.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are working on an energy strategy for 2020-2050. The decisive factor here is the role that oil will play in the coming decades. The fact is that the worldwide trend is towards greater demand for energy from oil. I have my doubts about whether more oil is needed in Europe. My aim in our strategies for 2020-2050 is to manage with less oil and to justify this approach and make the appropriate provisions. In other words, I am looking for a way out of oil consumption. This can be achieved in industry, private households, heating and other areas, such as oil-powered generation of electricity, but clearly, one area remains sensitive: the transport sector. Despite the expansion of our rail networks over the coming decades, oil will continue to be the key source of energy in air transport, for both passengers and cargo, and in the surface transport of heavy goods. Energy efficiency can be increased, reducing demand, and some demand can be shifted or avoided, but without oil, air travel and road transport by heavy goods vehicle will be impossible in the coming decades.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as cars are concerned, we are also pursuing the theme of renewable energies in the transport sector, setting ourselves a target of 10% renewables by the year 2020. At present, there are over 200 million cars registered in the Member States of the European Union. If we succeed in moving five million of these to electromobility by the year 2020, this will be an enormous success.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this still leaves 200 million running on oil with diesel and petrol engines. In other words, electromobility is on the way, but, whatever efficiencies we may achieve, oil will remain essential in the decades ahead if one accepts current individual mobility patterns and if one has an interest in car production. For this reason, we will continue to need oil for a relatively long time into the future and should not allow our dependence on third countries to rise to 100%, particularly since third countries often fail to satisfy our control and safety requirements to the same extent as Member States and the companies working here in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to mention liability and damage. I support full compensation and the principle that the polluter pays, whether culpable or not, as well as corporate liability, up to and including personal liability.</p>
      <p sl="de">Establishing preliminary solutions right from the outset would generalise the principle that the polluter pays and cause some of the costs to be passed on to the public, thereby reducing the companies’ interest in avoiding damage.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we should look at the question of whether we should propose compulsory insurance according to the cause and extent of damage. Thirdly, the question arises whether tax legislation in our Member States makes enough provision for possible liability and damage, and then fourthly, in my opinion, comes the question of the contributions to be levied in forming the fund.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to consider the topic of employment. BP, Shell, Total and others are large European employers that provide huge numbers of jobs, meaning that people’s livelihoods are at stake. I believe it is important to sustain jobs in the energy sector. I do not intend to speculate here, but the business sections of the European press are full of the question whether BP will remain an autonomous global company based in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue at stake there is market value and certain possible changes. Clearly, if BP is based in Europe, we can hold it to account, while a change in the shareholder structure would tend to weaken Europe’s position in all questions of safety between policy and private business – I will not go into the assumptions that might be made in relation to Chinese state-run companies.</p>
      <p sl="de">We shall be happy to report back to you in the coming days through the coordinators for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and I shall then return to this House in the autumn with our comprehensive proposals.</p>

We will return to this, and this is not the end of the procedure. I would also underline that the expansion of EMSA’s remit to drilling activities will be our first priority. We have to do this, and we completely understand that we have to do this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning people and demands for real and tangible results as regards renewable energy, I would just say that the EU 2020 strategy, the Commission’s strategy, focuses on giving research the funding and motivation to achieve results.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me in turn to express my satisfaction with this debate. This was my first debate under this Presidency, and I must say that I consider myself very lucky to have been able to take part in such a rich and lively debate which shows both a very broad consensus amongst Members and a fairly strong convergence with the proposals put forward by the Commission. For my part, I shall ensure that the debate is held at the Council and that this broad consensus and convergence is reproduced there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can clearly see, at the end of this debate, how a broadly accepted policy for Europe should look, and we can clearly see that, ultimately, as the saying goes: ‘Every cloud has a silver lining.’ If this disaster, which has occurred a long way from us, enables us Europeans to take stock of our body of regulations, to ensure that these are now strengthened, even though we are not facing a disaster, and to make sure that such disasters cannot occur, well some good will have come of it, and we will at least have the merit of having learnt every lesson we could from it. As many have said, what we will need to do is to review all our preventive rules, to examine them after having cooperated fully, of course, with the sector, with the public authorities and the regulatory authorities, but also – and I am emphasising this point for the benefit of the Commission – with independent experts, so that we can be sure that we have heard all possible points of view on these issues. If necessary, we should continue this process until we have a set of regulations that will almost certainly ensure – because there is no such thing as certainty in this area – that such accidents can never happen again. The proposal being made by the Commission to consider a moratorium is a fundamental proposal and, once again, I will ensure that the Council holds this debate and that a decision is taken as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second fundamental principle is the polluter pays principle and, therefore, the proposal of a form of insurance which offers two advantages: firstly, it ensures that if a disaster does occur – which we obviously do not want – those responsible for it will not be able to escape their financial obligations. This is crucially important. Secondly, if the insurance system is sufficiently well designed and sufficiently powerful, it will have the advantage of acting as a deterrent so that anybody considering venturing into hazardous drilling activities will be dissuaded by the insurance conditions imposed on them. This is an additional advantage of this type of system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, of course, it will be necessary to revise and review all the regulations relating to liability and the mechanisms for intervening in the event of a disaster. I have already just mentioned that it would be useful to review the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) rules, to ensure that they, and our civil protection mechanisms, provide all the resources we need to react in the event of a disaster. Finally, and above all else, what this disaster reminds us is that we in Europe showed particular foresight when, in December 2008, we adopted the climate and energy package, those famous 20/20/20 targets. It is, in some ways, a happy coincidence that, at the very moment when the previous US Administration was deciding to embark once again on risky drilling operations, in Alaska no less, and in the most extreme conditions, Europe was doing exactly the opposite, and seeking to procure the means for true energy efficiency and for a genuine transition towards renewable energies. We can only be pleased about this, and we must go on saying it; we must go on letting those around us know that this commitment we made nearly 18 months ago is getting stronger by the day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">30 June was the deadline by which all Member States had to submit their national action plans for the development of renewable energies. I do not know if all the Member States have submitted their plans, Commissioner. I am sure that the Commission is exerting legitimate pressure on them to obtain these plans within the time limits. Belgium submitted its plan 48 hours late, for which I apologise, but it has been submitted. These are documents which show that, this time, the fundamental industrial transition is under way; that this time, each Member State has examined all the internal processes required to complete this transition and, at the same time, has acknowledged its potential and the enormous amount of work involved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same applies to the assessment of energy efficiency. As you know, Commissioner – as perhaps you also know, ladies and gentlemen – the Presidency is very keen for us to make rapid progress in the area of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is the policy of all policies. Renewable energy policies are all very well, but it would be even better if no energy was consumed at all. We know that, when it comes to buildings – and this is in spite of the regulations that we have recently adopted, on the energy performance of buildings, for example – heating, industry and even transport, we can still make huge savings in Europe. This has been demonstrated by a large number of studies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we look at the assessments made of the regulations on private vehicles – on cars, for example – we can see how effective these regulations are; they have played a big part in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels, and particularly of oil, by European motorists, which demonstrates how relevant this policy is. As you know, Commissioner, we are awaiting the first results of the assessment of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan so that we can start work on a second, highly ambitious, plan as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will also re-examine, Mrs Damanaki, offshore renewable energies. As you know, Belgium is particularly keen on the North Sea for obvious geographical reasons. A short time ago, we, along with eight other Member States and another non-Member State, which also happens to have platforms and engages in oil exploration and drilling – Norway – took the initiative to sign, all 10 of us, an agreement to jointly build a wind farm in the North Sea. This is one of the largest ever renewable energy development projects. At the same time, we are also starting to consider the development of other renewable energy technologies on these North Sea wind farms to harness the power of the sea for energy generation. This is another issue to which we will return, although a major debate will still carry on in the meantime, because we will have to finalise the 2011-2020 Action Plan during this Presidency; in other words, we will have to realise our vision of energy for the next 10 years. This means translating those famous targets in the 2020 package into specific, concrete proposals, and providing associated funding solutions. We will also have to start the debate on the 2050 road map, the vision for 2050, which is, without doubt, the cornerstone of all the commitments we have made. Some scientists are saying today that Europe has a serious chance of achieving 100% renewable energies in 2050 if an effective energy efficiency policy is implemented and renewable energies are developed. This means that we will be free of fossil fuels in about 40 years’ time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is another debate which we will have to conduct and launch with the necessary ambition.</p>

      <p sl="lt">There has been much talk about what we should do to avoid events such as those in Mexico in the future. This is particularly relevant to us in Lithuania, because the oil exploration platform of a non-EU Member State is located close to our coastline. In the case of an accident on this platform, we would have an ecological disaster on the shores of the EU, the world’s most polluted sea. Moreover, there have, as yet, been no agreements with the states responsible for the platform on the clean-up of the aftermath of any accident on this platform. Another similar case may arise were there to be an accident in the Nord Stream pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea. All three cases mentioned are linked by one thing – the environmental impact assessment procedures carried out are paid for by the clients and therefore are not independent or objective. I call for discussions to commence on the establishment of a system ensuring independent environmental impact assessment. An essential part of such a system would be a fund financed by interested companies and administered by independent institutions which would fund environmental impact assessments, thus ensuring their objectivity. On the other hand, we must ensure that these rules on objectivity are applied in environmental impact assessments carried out not just by the EU, but by third countries as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, since we last discussed Kyrgyzstan in plenary on 20 April, further dramatic developments have unfolded in the country. In early June, the southern provinces of Kyrgyzstan witnessed a serious outburst of interethnic violence, which led to the tragic loss of hundreds of lives and many more injured, as well as hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the past few weeks, the provisional government has struggled to restore control over a situation which ran the risk of spilling into outright civil war and regional destabilisation. In this critical context, the peaceful and orderly conduct of the constitutional referendum on 27 June came – as I mentioned in a statement on 28 June – as a welcome development towards the re-establishment of the constitutional order and democratic process in Kyrgyzstan. The remarkably high turnout and the overwhelming support for the constitutional reform demonstrate the resilience and desire for peace of the citizens of Kyrgyzstan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The quick return of refugees from Uzbekistan and the relatively calm security situation currently prevailing throughout the country are encouraging signals. The remaining challenges, however, are considerable. As the country prepares for parliamentary elections in October and moves on towards further stabilisation, severe humanitarian needs, deep interethnic tensions and the weakness of institutions remain. Moreover, the political and economic situation of the country continues to be very fragile and violence could resume.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that the European Union has been active throughout this crisis. We have followed the events closely from the very beginning, and the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 June discussed the situation only days after the first outburst of violence. It will revert to it again in July. The EU Special Representative, Ambassador Morel, has been twice to the country. He has had extensive discussions with the Kyrgyzstan authorities and other international stakeholders, including the UN and the OSCE. His team has been substantially strengthened to help him pursue his active role in this critical period.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its response, the EU has not spared its diplomatic and humanitarian efforts. The Commission swiftly provided humanitarian aid. Commissioner Georgieva has just returned from the region, where she was able to take stock on delivery of aid and further needs on the ground. The Commissioner knows the area very well. I am delighted that she is with us for this debate. I pay tribute to the incredible work that she has done there and elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also in the process of stepping up our efforts to support the stabilisation and democratisation processes initiated by the provisional government, notably by assisting in the preparation of the forthcoming parliamentary elections, strengthening key institutions and supporting interethnic reconciliation and civil society initiatives, as well as social stabilisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The emergence of a stable and democratic Kyrgyzstan in a hitherto authoritarian and unstable part of the world is a goal we are ready to support. As regards the security aspects and possible EU engagement, we are liaising actively with the UN and OSCE together with others. We are looking carefully into initiatives currently on the table, including the OSCE proposal for a police task force.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to security, as for all other areas for EU engagement, our course of action has been that of close and constant coordination with the international community. We are in touch with the Kyrgyzstan authorities, as well as with the OSCE and UN, regarding the intention of Bishkek to set up a national commission to investigate the June events in the southern provinces. International experts and assistance have been requested.</p>
      <p sl="en">Establishing the facts constitutes an indispensable preliminary step towards fighting impunity, encouraging reconciliation between communities and preventing such events from occurring again. We will therefore insist on the need to ensure the credibility and impartiality of any truth finding commission, be it of international or national character. We will support international efforts. In this regard, coordination with the OSCE and the UN is key.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward very much to hearing honourable Members’ views on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the Parliament for this – I was going to use the word ‘timely’ – discussion but given that a soccer game is going on at this precise moment, it may not be as fortunate as we would have hoped. Yet I am impressed that there is a very long list of speakers and I am very grateful for everybody who is in the room and is watching on the screens tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the High Representative reported, the eruption of ethnic violence in the south of Kyrgyzstan has now calmed down and the humanitarian phase is largely over. When I was in Osh, I could see the return of vendors on the street and people venturing out again, although there was still occasional shooting in some of the neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to confirm that our humanitarian response was swift, appropriate and well-targeted. On 16 June, we provided EUR 5 million of emergency assistance which was immediately deployed for experts in Osh to coordinate and we used the three organisations present there – the Red Cross, ACTED and Médecins Sans Frontières – to deploy this assistance. I can say that we did help save lives and provide food, water and shelter but, more importantly, we had a physical presence that, in the eyes of the people in Osh, was the main contribution to safety and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through me, people send their gratitude to the European Union. Today, beneath the calm, there are deep tensions and fears that the violence may return again. A mother of a five-year-old girl who was shot in front of her eyes told me: ‘How can I live with myself if there is no justice?’ There are thousands of people like her, and their patience is wearing thin. There is little confidence among the population that the government can control the situation in the south if it explodes again, and humanitarian organisations are stocking supplies to be ready in case violence returns.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this environment, as the High Representative stressed, there are two priorities for our support: restoring trust among the main Uzbek and Kyrgyz ethnic groups and restoring the livelihoods and housing affected by the conflict. Of those, reconciliation is by far the more difficult and the more important objective. Both the government and the people in Osh firmly believe that the chance of success for reconciliation is much higher with the support of the international community. As the High Representative reported, President Otunbayeva has already asked the EU for help with an international inquiry into the source of the conflict and an international police contingent to train and reinforce local police. I would like to add that this is also the strong wish of the people in Osh who I met: they very explicitly asked for help with the inquiry and help with the police.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish by assuring you that the Commission will make every effort to help Kyrgyzstan in the tough months ahead. We will support the restoration of livelihoods through cash-for-work and cash-for-food programmes, the rehabilitation of damaged houses and the provision of construction materials to families – Osh is a very cold place in the winter and that has to be done quickly – as well as legal and psychological support to victims. In addition, the instrument for stability will provide EUR 7 million for elections, legislative support and social and physical rehabilitation. An international donors’ conference will take place on 27 July and the Commission will take an active part in it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was very touched by the vote of confidence the Kyrgyz authorities and ordinary people have in Europe. Europe is perceived as neutral and caring, supportive of human rights, supportive of democracy, and able to galvanise the international community to help this small island of democracy at the heart of Central Asia which is surrounded by authoritarian regimes. The discussion this evening in the European Parliament proves this confidence and the value of this confidence, and I would very much like to thank you for it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight that the situation in Kyrgyzstan reflects a reality which, for too long, has not been given the importance it deserves. The reality I refer to is the instability in Central Asia, which is unfortunately increasing, while hopes for democracy and economic progress, at least in many of these countries, are especially fragile. In recent months, Kyrgyzstan has suffered as a result of harsh conflicts that will leave a legacy of interethnic strife, at least in the immediate future, making the stabilisation of that country even more difficult than it was in the past.</p>
      <p sl="it">As has already been said, the role of the international community and of the European Union in particular is to aid Kyrgyzstan as much as possible in three ways: firstly, by providing immediate aid for emergency supplies and rebuilding the damaged homes; secondly – as regards the European Union within the framework of the Central Asia strategy and the instruments implemented in that context – by providing financial aid that is as long term as possible; and, thirdly, by providing political support to aid the process of restoring constitutional order and the development of the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="it">The constitutional referendum held in Kyrgyzstan on 28 June, in what were clearly very difficult conditions, may be regarded as the first step on the road to restoring constitutional order. The elections of 28 June also received the approval of the OSCE observation mission, which obviously took into account the special conditions in which the referendum was held.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new constitutional order in Kyrgyzstan will be directed more towards a parliamentary system than a presidential system. This will perhaps allow for greater recognition of the various ethnic groups in the country and of the need to obtain the consensus of the various groups in such a divided and composite country. The European Union and Kyrgyzstan are bound by a partnership and cooperation agreement that provides for regular meetings by a parliamentary cooperation committee. Our hope is that our inter-parliamentary relations will resume as soon as possible, with the participation of a democratically elected Kyrgyz parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">As has already been said, in the immediate future, Kyrgyzstan needs stability and our political and financial support: let us not stint on either.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank the High Representative and the Commissioner for their rapid and coordinated response. As the Commissioner has said, what is needed is a ‘swift, appropriate and targeted’ response. According to my information, this is precisely what has happened.</p>
      <p sl="de">These ethnic tensions are particularly regrettable. We must remember that in this part of the world too, borders have not been drawn precisely according to ethnicity. This is actually a good thing. If we were always to follow the principle of ethnicity, we would never be able to draw up borders. However, failure to respect this principle can lead to ethnic tensions when combined with social and economic difficulties. We hope that all those involved, including all neighbouring countries, will now put these tensions behind them and make a new start.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton has mentioned our Special Representative, Mr Morel, whom I hold in high regard. Perhaps the time has come, as I mentioned before, to revitalise the Central Asia strategy that we followed under the German Presidency in particular, since I believe that this is a very important region; located near Afghanistan and between Russia and China, the region is fragile and full of tensions and is of particular interest to Europe. I believe that the commitment we are demonstrating in this case is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="de">How many of us were worried about the referendum? I must admit that I myself was not convinced by the timing. However, it is now clear that the time was right and that the correct action was taken. Sometimes we also tend to think in categories, holding on to a belief that strong men and women are needed to develop a country so that democracy will eventually follow. The new interim President – a woman with vision, strength and decisiveness, as well as a determination for greater democracy – has shown that it is possible to have both. This could also serve as a good example for the surrounding region. They do not necessarily need long-term presidents who will remain in office forever. A country can also be helped by the combination of democratic principles and an individual with a clear strategy – in this case a woman. We hope that the President and her country will achieve this with the support of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any more pogroms in Central Asia.</p>
      <p sl="it">Central Asia is a region that presents a high risk of interethnic conflicts. The peoples are very mixed, and the borders were drawn up under the Stalinist regime. Just consider that Kyrgyzstan has a Kyrgyz exclave in Uzbek territory, and there are four Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory, including one that is inhabited exclusively by Uzbek citizens living in Kyrgyzstan who are of Tajik nationality – this shows the complexity of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">We now have 300 000 people who are displaced. One hundred thousand people have taken refuge in Uzbekistan and very many have died: we do not even know how many, possibly even 2 000. What can be done? First of all, as the Commissioner stated, it is very important to guarantee justice, because – as the experience of other countries demonstrates – there can be no reconciliation without a form of justice. Therefore, we need to persevere with this committee of inquiry.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second point: while continuing to provide humanitarian aid, we also need to deal with a number of political issues. Mr Swoboda mentioned one, namely, that we must confirm to this interim government that it is, in fact, doing a good job. The referendum was a success not only from the point of view of its content, because it redresses the balance of the relationship between the Presidency and the parliament, but also because of the way in which it was organised and because of its high turnout.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to understand how we Europeans should respond, if we do respond, to the OSCE request to send international police forces: shall we leave policing entirely up to the Russians, or will there also be a European contribution?</p>
      <p sl="it">The third point: what is the United States doing? It has a very large military base in Manas, but it seems to me that US influence in Central Asia is declining in general. I think it is important for us to harmonise certain issues with the US Administration as well. As for the 27 July donors’ conference mentioned by the Commissioner, I would like to understand what Europe’s priorities are here. I believe that we need to invest, above all, in education and in strengthening the civil society that exists in Kyrgyzstan. It is active, as the high turnout at the referendum showed.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by emphasising that the European strategy of taking a regional approach to Central Asia is certainly the right one. This is a region that needs to be considered in its entirety. I think that in the medium term, we will gradually need to apply this strategy to Afghanistan, too, because we cannot have one policy for Afghanistan and another for the countries of Central Asia – for the other countries of Central Asia. This is a paradigm case for the prevention of conflict, a little like what EU-FAST turned out not to be for Haiti, through the coordination of civil and emergency protection. We now have the legal instruments: the citizens wanted them, and we need to prove that we are up to the challenge.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, it is extremely important to discover the origins of this violence. I know what Alain Délétroz, Vice President of the International Crisis Group, thinks. He says that these events recall what happened in the Western Balkans in the 1990s. These atrocities, which have been described here and about which we have read in the newspapers, recall the horrendous cruelty that was witnessed in the Western Balkans. There is reason to suspect that these acts were meant to provoke. We are not at all convinced that this is about genuine ethnic tensions: it is more likely to be about ethnic tensions that have been stirred up because southern Kyrgyzstan is a very poor and deprived region.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would especially like to bring to the High Representative’s attention and that of Commissioner Georgieva the fact that human rights defenders are now in an awkward position. I think it seems that we are now looking for the guilty in the wrong place. There are witness statements that certain individuals, who have gone to look for evidence and to document these brutalities, have themselves become the targets of official action.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I myself have appealed on behalf of the human rights defender, Azimzhan Askarov. He was detained and is still under arrest, as far as anyone knows. He collected evidence of the events surrounding these brutalities. In that sense, he might be dangerous as far as some parties are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would ask the Commission and the High Representative to give their special attention to ensuring that human rights organisations are able to act effectively, as they probably now have the best opportunities to discover what is really going on and to try and establish peace and stability.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, two weeks ago, I was in Uzbekistan. I had meetings with senior ministers in Tashkent who briefed me extensively on the refugee crisis arising from the recent violence in southern Kyrgyzstan. I have written to the High Representative in detail on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Uzbek Government has little hesitation in blaming former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev for playing a pivotal role in this uprising in the cities of Osh and Jalalabad in southern Kyrgyzstan. They point out that the Kyrgyz and Uzbek population in these cities have lived together in harmony for millennia. The ministers I met are convinced that the level of violence and brutality perpetrated against innocent civilians was horrific and could only have been carried out by experienced mercenary killers – perhaps veterans of Afghanistan or Chechnya – and they reckon that about 2 000 people were killed. Apparently, many of the victims were shot by trained marksmen, pregnant women were disembowelled, young girls were brutally raped and murdered, and babies were decapitated and their bodies hurled into the river.</p>
      <p sl="en">This level of violence would be bizarre and unlikely in an uprising involving local Kyrgyz youths alone, although teenagers and young men from both the Kyrgyz and Uzbek populations did get involved when they witnessed the extent of the violence that was taking place. The general view in Tashkent is that this uprising was planned well in advance and financed by Bakiyev with the orders on the ground in southern Kyrgyzstan being relayed by his family and loyal supporters.</p>
      <p sl="en">The resulting exodus of refugees across the border into Uzbekistan numbered in excess of 100 000. These refugees were accommodated in 15 camps set up near the border. The Uzbek Government provided a good level of tented accommodation, sanitary facilities, food and medical aid for this vast influx of people, but the numbers far exceeded anything they could ever have predicted and they are having difficulty sustaining the cost of the operation. They are particularly desperate to receive financial aid to purchase foodstuffs. They fear that the refugee problem may be long term, as many of the displaced Uzbeks are afraid to return to their homes in Kyrgyzstan because of the massive violence they witnessed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 15 refugee camps in Uzbekistan are now crammed full with elderly people, women, children and many wounded, all of whom are receiving proper medical attention from the Uzbek authorities. Some of these refugees have now returned to Kyrgyzstan, but many have taken their tents with them and set up camps just across the border, ready to flee back to Uzbekistan again at the first sign of trouble. They are terrified to return to Osh or Jalalabad, where more than 75% of Uzbek homes and most Uzbek businesses have been destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Uzbek Government is, of course, grateful for the EUR 5 million offered in aid to the Kyrgyz and Uzbek governments by the EU. They urge the UN to provide personnel to oversee the distribution of all aid on the ground, but they reaffirm that they require around EUR 5 million a day in Uzbekistan alone to deal adequately with the refugee crisis. They have all the supplies of grain and the other essential foodstuffs and medicines in Uzbekistan, but they cannot sustain the distribution of these commodities without financial support. The Uzbek Government stresses the need for an international inquiry into the circumstances surrounding this uprising, and I am delighted that we will support this in this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is only two months since the revolutionary events in Kyrgyzstan led to the overthrow of the corrupt Bakiyev regime and the formation of a provisional government. Unfortunately, however, as we pointed out at the time and just before the recent violence, one group of looters was merely replaced by another as reports of corruption and cronyism quickly emerged relating to elements in the new government.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent violence directed against people based on their ethnic group is a further nightmare for the ordinary people. It was not spontaneous, but was whipped up. There are credible claims that Bakiyev elements, in association with criminal gangs, were responsible.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is very significant is that Uzbek and Kyrgyz neighbours in many areas attempted to help each other in opposition to these pogroms. It is the coming together of working people and the poor – both Kyrgyz and Uzbek – that lays the basis for a solution, linked to radical demands to bring the wealth of the nation into public ownership so that it is utilised, for a change, for the benefit of the majority of the ordinary people, rather than for the corrupt elites that have dominated society up until now.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the horrors that took place in southern Kyrgyzstan in the middle of June have left a traumatised society in their wake. Can the international community or the European Union offer any perspective in this social climate of impunity, in which both the Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities regard themselves as victims par excellence of a veritable orgy of murderous violence? To this basic question I received a resoundingly positive answer, as well as a number of bright ideas, yesterday morning from a Western aid worker based in Bishkek with whom I had a telephone conversation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is of paramount importance for the future of Kyrgyzstan is to carry out a thorough, independent investigation into the horrors of last month. We really must put an end to the prevailing culture of impunity in the country, in the interests of establishing a reliable authority there and in the interests of ethnic coexistence. I should therefore like to see the European Union take the lead by initiating an international investigation, and I understand from the High Representative and the Commission that they will be strongly supporting such a move. This thorough investigation into the events will be the basis for a new beginning, because the stories and testimonies are conflicting and because no one trusts the authorities there to carry out a proper investigation. As a practical suggestion for the kind of assistance that Europe could lend to the suffering civilian population of Kyrgyzstan, my contact in Bishkek highlighted structural aid for the country’s food supply and educational system. Mr Rinaldi spoke about that earlier on. Education is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude, I would urge the Council and the Commission to pay attention to the fundamental right of religious freedom in Kyrgyzstan. The Religion Act of 2009, another relic of the Bakiyev regime, should immediately be sent for legal review. It is time for Europe to show Kyrgyzstan the way forward in this area too, while deploying humanitarian and educational efforts in the country. I have to pay my compliments to both the High Representative and the Commissioner for this European commitment which, to my delight, has also been welcomed appreciatively by the people of Kyrgyzstan. Keep up the good work.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, over the past year, I have often felt here, in the European Parliament’s building, that maybe it is pointless for us to speak about events that take place outside the European Union. However, these events in Kyrgyzstan are completely different. No civilised country, and certainly not the European Union, can ignore such ethnic genocide and such a tendency to drive hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes, which is what we have seen in Kyrgyzstan. However, in order to solve these problems, we first have to understand the reasons. As a member of Jobbik, I can see four main reasons.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The first and most important reason behind these problems is Stalin’s unjust ‘divide and conquer’ principle. Under this policy, borders were drawn without taking into account ethnic regions, presuming that this would generate ethnic conflicts. The second reason is that valuable areas were not divided fairly between states, again resulting in unfair borders, potentially capable of creating conflict. The third reason which, unfortunately, has not been mentioned yet, is the existence of radicalised extremist Islamic groups, probably most prevalent in the Fergana Valley, which have also been the source of various problems. The issue of water is also very significant in Kyrgyzstan. Cotton accounts for ninety percent of Uzbekistan’s exports and it is well known that if Kyrgyzstan cuts off the water supply, it will only be a matter of months before Uzbekistan’s economy collapses. Most importantly, and we really have to say this, these problems must be remedied because, ladies and gentlemen, unless steps are taken, we will see further genocide again and again. We need to take action because we are fully aware that this Central Asian or Inner Asian region, not only Kyrgyzstan, but also Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, is regarded as an unstable area. In order to prevent conflicts, we must first and foremost guarantee fair water distribution. Second, we must help ensure, in one way or another, that border crossing is eased between these countries and we must help eliminate ethnic problems and tensions. We have to achieve some form of regional cooperation between these countries, namely Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. We have to make sure that they are interested in peaceful co-existence. We have to establish a system built on mutual trust. The European Union has a particularly important role in this, as I am absolutely certain that the role of mediator must be played by the European Parliament and the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was very pleased with the outcome of the national referendum on 27 June. The excellent results show that the people of Kyrgyzstan want to play an active role in political decision making and support a new constitution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our cross-party resolution on the current situation in Kyrgyzstan should be seen as a helpful step in this direction. We expect the interim government to restore public order by legal and peaceful means and that it will do everything in its power to promote reconciliation among its citizens. Even though the immediate emergency now seems to have passed, I believe it is very important for the European Union to continue to support the people of Kyrgyzstan, as well as others, by backing this interim government and helping it achieve stability. In my opinion, the reconciliation of the various ethnic groups must be the top priority in the development of Kyrgyzstan, so that the people can live together in peace.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our concern in the European Parliament is to ensure that a new inter-parliamentary exchange should take place immediately after the planned parliamentary elections. This is one of the keys to fruitful cooperation between Kyrgyzstan and the European Union. I believe it to be of fundamental importance that the European Union should take an all-embracing approach in its dealings with Central Asia and that we should not focus exclusively on individual regions. Open dialogue must always be at the heart of this. In this way, the European Union will be seen as a political partner, in addition to its role as a partner in economic and development issues. From our perspective, democratisation and respect for human rights provide the basis for peaceful coexistence in all countries. This resolution draws attention to the continuing fragile situation in this country.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Baroness Ashton, Mrs Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, Kyrgyzstan frequently appears on the agenda of the European Parliament and the specialist Committee on Foreign Affairs. This indicates the importance we attach both to this country and to the European Union’s policy in Central Asia as a whole. The events going on there are very fast-moving and conflicting. The attempts to stabilise the new government were accompanied by an outburst of heavy ethnic clashes during which, according to various estimates, between 300 and 2 000 people died, while 100 000 sought refuge in neighbouring Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Incidentally, we must pay tribute to the Uzbeks for their composure which has prevented the conflict from escalating. On the other hand, a suitable response from the Kyrgyz authorities led to order being restored relatively quickly. However, achieving lasting stability in this part of the country requires the instigators of the conflict and the perpetrators of the crimes to be identified and punished.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The country’s interim leadership must also be given lofty praise for showing determination in defending the political reforms carried out in the country and for not using the clashes in Osh and Jalalabad to postpone the scheduled referendum. Indicative of this is that literally days after the clashes in Kyrgyzstan, the referendum was held successfully and changed the balance of influence of the various institutions, giving more powers to the Kyrgyz parliament and government respectively at the expense of the presidential powers.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In addition to this, an important step was also taken to give greater legitimacy to the interim president, Roza Otunbayeva, who was confirmed in this temporary post, following consultations, until the end of 2011. Parliamentary elections are also envisaged for the autumn. I am emphasising these facts because our position must take all details into account. The European Union responded quickly and appropriately, which I would like to thank you for.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, the time is coming when we will need to review our current policy and look for opportunities for the European Union to make a more serious commitment to both Kyrgyzstan and the Central Asian region. We have the necessary financial instruments available. However, as in other regions, we must work from now on in such a way that transforms us from a main donor into a genuine political player, along with Russia, China and the United States. It seems to me that we are the very ones who can help overcome the biggest shortage in the region, which is the shortage of democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, as many Members have already said, the situation in Kyrgyzstan is still fragile, and I am sorry that the resolution does not reflect the speeches made here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If I may be so bold, I should like to ask who stands to gain from an increase in violence in that country. Who stands to gain from the failure to establish democracy there? Who stands to gain from preventing the provisional government from completing the process of restoring democratic constitutional order and the rule of law? Who stands to gain from the ethnicisation of violence? Anybody who knows a little about that country just needs to ask themselves these questions to realise what the situation is. How can the fact that the referendum on 27 June took place in peaceful conditions, with a high turnout rate, and with over 90% voting in favour of the new constitution, be regarded as anything other than a miracle?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, Baroness Ashton, Mrs Georgieva, the EU must commit itself fully to Kyrgyzstan, but without interfering, and must provide all the assistance necessary to ensure that the people of that country, irrespective of their origins, do not become the victims of political and diplomatic issues which have nothing to do with them. Let us not betray the trust the Kyrgyz people have in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I do not think any of us can fail to be sympathetic to the people of Kyrgyzstan for the recent suffering they have endured: 2 000 dead in rioting and 400 000 people displaced – mainly from the Uzbek community – placing enormous pressure on Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an immense crisis, in the words of the Red Cross. This country is already the poorest and the smallest of the former Soviet republics. It is tragic for a country that aspires so earnestly for parliamentary democracy to be in this kind of state. Indeed, the trigger seemed to have been the constitutional changes that they wished to aspire to. It is also one of the few Muslim nations in the world to be headed up by a woman; let us hope that Iran follows shortly. This lady, Roza Otunbayeva, is the first president of an ex-communist central Asian country – and good for her.</p>
      <p sl="en">All democratic nations should be doing all they can to support an aspiring parliamentary democracy of this sort, but it is swimming in a sea of powerful autocratic neighbours and with the ever-present threat of radical Islam on its borders. This nation is a bulkhead of democracy and deserves our support.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fear it has become a pawn in larger power games. It is now part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which China and Russia use to dominate the Central Asian landmass and whose agenda should be regarded with some suspicion. China and Russia have incentives to destabilise the country to threaten the presence of an American airbase there as well, with covert backing of opposition forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I conclude by saying that all democratic nations should support this brave, aspiring but deeply troubled nation.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Five years after the change of power in Kyrgyzstan, the new revolution has brought about a more severe political crisis, with consequences for the wider region. It is important to note that, despite the crisis, the referendum on constitutional changes – which will be followed by parliamentary elections in the autumn – passed off peacefully and democratically.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In addition to democratic elections, further stabilisation requires an objective examination of the causes of the tragic conflict in the southern part of this country, efforts to reconcile the Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities, the prevention of further humanitarian disaster and the effective coordination of international aid.</p>
      <p sl="sl">At the same time, we need to pay more attention than we did five years ago to assisting with the introduction of good governance in the long term. Police or legal assistance alone are not enough. The activities of the international community, including Turkey, should lead to the earliest possible opening up of Kyrgyzstan’s borders with all of its neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I am pleased with the European Union’s prompt involvement and I am convinced that we will be able to ensure, as indeed we must, that the pace and effectiveness of our action brings added value. This time, it is humanitarian concerns that are paramount, but we will not be able to address them permanently unless, at the same time, we act with a clear political concept.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is clear that Kyrgyzstan is in need of substantial international assistance, that the political changes that have occurred since the referendum will not bring rapid or positive results by themselves, and that this crisis is in no way in the interests of the European Union. I hope that we will be successful in this undertaking.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The situation in Kyrgyzstan has resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. In this situation, the European Union and the European Parliament must both understand that if we are willing to sacrifice human rights for stability in certain parts of the world, it will not be a matter of the right to vote or to be represented, but of the fundamental human right, which is the right to life.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EU has provided funding and humanitarian aid. I would also like to thank Baroness Ashton very much for the fact that we really did respond very rapidly. However, this is only the beginning, in my opinion.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EU has to understand that its strategy for central Asia is very weak. We should allocate more funding and more political importance to this region, which really is a region that sees the European Union as its shining example, as many previous speakers have pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I recently visited Kazakhstan and Tajikistan with some fellow Members of Parliament, and we indeed saw for ourselves that these people believe we can provide them with real assistance.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, therefore, this is what the EU should focus on. We should increase our influence, since there is a threat here from Russia and China, of course, who are waiting for us to slip up so that they can step in as the powerful guarantors, ensuring stability, peace and cooperation in the region.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We really must get to grips with the fact that this region is extremely important for us, whether as a transport route between China and the EU or as a region with huge natural resources – indeed vast natural resources – which the EU also needs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Stability in this region is therefore also important for us. We also need to secure peace in the region because it includes Afghanistan. That is also an issue we must not forget.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also have a question for Mr Stevenson, who is not listening now, but I hope it reaches him. He made comments to the effect that the unrest was actually caused by certain supporters or family members of the former President Bakiyev.</p>
      <p sl="sk">My question is: can we actually exclude the possibility that the family of former President Bakiyev was involved? It is absolutely necessary to mount a thorough investigation into what happened, in order to determine where the truth really lies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It seems to me we are all saying what has caused the present crisis in Kyrgyzstan. The authority of President Bakiyev had come to be so hated that he was overthrown, but there have also been massacres and a humanitarian catastrophe in the Fergana Valley, in particular, in the region of Osh and Jalalabad. The significance of the Fergana Valley for the sub-region has already been pointed out here, how it is so important because of its sources of water, but it should also be noted that the massacres were, in part, inspired by radical groups – names being mentioned here are the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the Islamic Jihad Union. They were financed – according to some – by sources which include the son of the overthrown President Bakiyev.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A referendum has been held on changes to the constitution. We welcome the fact that as many as 90% of those who voted supported the changes. The country is now led by President Otunbayeva, who is a strong woman who wants these changes. She has the support of the majority of society, and she wants the Kyrgyzstan parliament to be strengthened. This is a great success of the current authorities in Kyrgyzstan. We should support this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The way the referendum passed off peacefully and the good assessments it received, including from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, create the impression of stability, but in fact, the stability is very fragile and very superficial. The causes of this include erosion of state structures in Kyrgyzstan and the elections due to take place on 10 October, which do not allow faster reforms to be made, and also the economic and social crisis, as well as informal authority structures within Kyrgyzstan and groups which could be called criminal groups. On top of this, of course, there is the humanitarian disaster, which we are trying to tackle, but which, of course, has still not been overcome completely.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, these problems are being made worse by the somewhat inaccurate approach being taken by Russia and China, the main players in the region, and which, of course, is different from the approach of the United States. We have already said, here, that Russia, for reasons which include the presence of a US base at Manas, has a different approach to Kyrgyzstan, and that obviously has an enormous influence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I very much support what the Commissioners said about the need to intensify the humanitarian aid, and that we should also appoint an independent commission to investigate the causes of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I have followed the events of recent months in Kyrgyzstan closely, in particular, when the name Roza Otunbayeva began to appear in the media. Ten years ago, she was a colleague of mine – she was the ambassador for her country in London. The Lithuanian and Kyrgyz embassies were next door to each other. We often met and chatted. I got the impression that Roza Otunbayeva is not just an experienced diplomat, but a strong politician with democratic views, soberly assessing the situation in both her own country and the world. I feel that her election as President of Kyrgyzstan should stabilise the situation in the country, help kick-start reforms and improve relations with neighbours near and far.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Kyrgyzstan is becoming the first parliamentary republic in the region and it should no longer be run by family clans. However, the situation remains particularly complex. Ethnic Uzbek refugees, who have not yet returned to their homes, ignored the referendum. The risk of unrest remains, especially in the run up to parliamentary elections in the autumn.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The European Union Member States urgently need to agree on specific mechanisms and measures for EU involvement, which could be implemented should the conflict continue to deepen. An EU crisis reaction mission should play an important role there. We need to strengthen the coordination mechanisms between the United Nations, the EU and OSCE.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I call on Kyrgyzstan’s law enforcement authorities to bring to book the perpetrators of the bloody events, while ensuring them a fair trial. Ensuring people’s rights to health care, education and work would be the best way of uniting society, injecting democracy and combating corruption and radicalism.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been shocked by recent events in Kyrgyzstan – the violent outbreaks, human slaughter, the burning of houses and the flood of thousands of refugees leaving their homes in an effort to escape the violence – and am filled with sympathy for the victims. At the same time, these events in Kyrgyzstan throw light on the situation in Central Asia, which should not leave us unconcerned here in the European Parliament. On the contrary, we should turn all our attention to the countries of this region. We should consider not just those countries that are rich in mineral resources, making them of particular economic interest to us in Europe, but, in line with the strategy for Central Asia adopted in 2007, we should deal with all countries equally. I believe that this is our duty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The states of Central Asia, which managed to throw off Tsarist and then Soviet rule less than 20 years ago, have a difficult legacy. The borders drawn up arbitrarily by Stalin with no concern for the homelands of the peoples living in the region clearly make coexistence difficult both within the borders of these countries and beyond. Poverty, corruption, disregard for human rights and minority rights, authoritarian regimes, economic conditions in countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which force hundreds of thousands to emigrate in search of work, and conflict resolution through the use of violent force, all mean that there is a question mark over how the countries in this region are to develop in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union cannot stand idly by while this happens. If we want to ensure that these states do not end up adopting fundamentalist structures and that the people there are not permanent victims of dictatorial regimes, then our complete commitment is required. In addition to answering the urgent need for material help, we need contact with these countries, offering active support for the democratic forces developing there. Let us allow President Roza Otunbayeva the chance to bring peace to Kyrgyzstan and to begin the establishment of stable political conditions. The resolution debated today and voted on tomorrow should be followed by actions, so that the people in Kyrgyzstan and the other Central Asian states do not feel that we are leaving them alone to find their future path or abandoning them to undemocratic forces. These countries have high expectations of us Europeans and we should not disappoint them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the origin of the situation in Kyrgyzstan lies in the completely arbitrary and intentionally incorrect drawing of boundaries throughout the region of Central Asia several decades ago, creating a number of minorities. This, together with poverty and the struggle for water and for land suitable for development, has created a powder keg, which has, unfortunately, exploded once again.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that if lasting peace is to be established throughout the region, then these central issues, above all, the minorities issue, will have to be resolved. Following the admirable rapid action by the Commission, we shall also have to deal with these issues in the region in the future. The countries will have to protect their minorities and create the right conditions that will allow the members of these minority groups to feel secure in the region. Once a new political leadership comes to power in Kyrgyzstan, we shall have to address this question with the politicians responsible. I think that a situation in which minorities are disadvantaged creates the preconditions for radicalisation and, as the region also shows, when religious radicalism is added to the mix, the result is a powder keg that can, unfortunately, explode very quickly indeed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, our exchange today underlines the European Union’s very deep concern as regards the situation in Kyrgyzstan and the importance for us to remain closely engaged in helping the country move forward towards peace, stability, interethnic reconciliation and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been widespread agreement that our efforts should be placed firmly within the broader international context. I believe that it is important, and I trust that honourable Members agree, that we continue to coordinate very closely with the United Nations and the OSCE and, as Mr Rinaldi said, that we also look to the fact that justice is going to be extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members know, as things stand, the exact causes of the crisis are unclear. Honourable Members have raised the issue of the role of the former leadership within this. Honourable Members have also raised their concerns about ensuring that justice is done and that we have the kind of inquiry that could be of great significance. In that context, the involvement of human rights organisations is something which I pick up and take forward as an important aspect of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members have noted too, security in the south has recently improved, but we are all aware that there is a risk of the resumption of violence and regional spillover; the potential for this still persists. I am very well aware that the interethnic resentment remains very high. We have to be very vigilant and continue to discuss, debate, watch, engage and work with our partners on the ground to ensure that we are able to do everything we can to help this democracy grow and flourish.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that the Representative, Pierre Morrel, will do what he can to continue that work on the ground. For my part, I will do my utmost, working with Commissioner Georgieva to ensure that the response that we give is commensurate with this challenge. In doing that, we will certainly take into account the very thoughtful views that honourable Members have given tonight as we move forward.</p>

    <intervention id="3-486" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kristalina Georgieva" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank honourable Members for the very useful direction that you have provided for us in your speeches tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me touch upon four points that have been raised. First, a number of Members talked about the importance of the referendum and the right judgment that was made. I would like to elaborate on that by praising Baroness Ashton and Ambassador Morel because the EU in fact – and I learned this in Bishkek – was instrumental in gathering international support to keep the date of the referendum as it was. That was the right judgment because it boosted the legitimacy of the government substantially and it also served as a magnet to refugees to return.</p>
      <p sl="en">That takes me to my second point – the situation on the other side of the border. Almost the only people on the other side of the border in Uzbekistan are those who needed medical attention. The vast majority of those who crossed the border did return, although – as has been said – there is still a fear of events unfolding at too critical a time. When 40 days from the massacres have passed and mourning is over, there is fear that around 15 to 20 July, there could be a return of violence, as well as when the country gets ready for the elections prior to 10 October.</p>
      <p sl="en">That takes me to my third point. I would just like to share with you that President Otunbayeva praised President Karimov of Uzbekistan for his appropriate reaction and for the support that they have received from their neighbour in suppressing violence. But, having said that, President Otunbayeva continues to call on us – on Europe – for support in the days ahead because of her worry that democracy may be struggling in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish with a point related to priorities and how we move forward. The country will need help. It is a poor country. I used to work there in the 1990s and I can see how much progress has been made on democracy and how the country still has a long way to go on development. It is of concern that some of the donors – including some European donors – have been in the process of actually reducing their programmes. I just want to share with this House that it is the wrong time to decrease support for development in Kyrgyzstan. We will, of course, convey from the Commission to the donor community that, in our judgment, this is now the wrong time to reduce support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kyrgyzstan is, to a great extent, a clan society, and the pursuit of parliamentary democracy there is not going to be easy. Mrs Otunbayeva is a brave woman who, during her inauguration, which I was honoured to attend, turned to us and said that she would have a short run as President. She pledged to step down at the end of 2011 but promised that it would be a substantive run and asked us to help her to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think she deserves this help and that, if we stand by her, there will be a fair chance for this country to leap forward – for its people, but also for stability in this region that would benefit all of us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this session on human rights and HIV/AIDS. It is a timely debate, as we are only 11 days from the opening of the 18th World AIDS Conference, which will take place in Vienna.</p>
      <p sl="en">The spread of HIV continues to cause considerable suffering. The impact of HIV is worse in situations where human rights are not respected, and we know that conflict situations can lead to an increase in HIV infections, especially when sexual abuse against women and children is common. In the absence of proper anti-discrimination laws, people living with HIV are often too frightened to come forward for help because of fear of stigma.</p>
      <p sl="en">In countries where homosexuality is criminalised, some face the additional fear of imprisonment and, in extreme cases, even the death penalty. Human rights should empower individuals, including people affected with HIV. The right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health implies that those who are affected by HIV must have access to information as well as to effective prevention and treatment options. Affected people should not be discriminated against because of that status.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, we know that HIV infection is used in some countries as a reason to exclude asylum seekers from their right to seek protection. Infected persons may lose their right to work; infected children are sometimes excluded from school. The European Union has been at the forefront of the defence of the rights of HIV-affected and infected people. The European Council adopted conclusions in November 2009, with an EU programme for action to confront HIV/AIDS through external action, including the need to address the human rights aspect.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has been very active in promoting freedom of travel for people living with HIV. Our stance is that HIV-specific restrictions on entry, stay and residence based on that status are discriminatory and do not protect public health. We therefore welcome the recent modifications of the regulations in the US and in China as positive signs. In the last months, EU representatives, both in Brussels and in partner countries, have made several démarches on this issue, including voicing EU concerns about the criminalisation of sexual behaviour among consenting adults – Uganda, Burundi, Malawi – or harassment of AIDS activists by police and judicial authorities in Senegal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent adoption of an EU tool kit to help promote and protect the respect of human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people will further consolidate EU action in this area.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I want to thank Mrs Ashton very much, because – although everyone is watching the match outside – we in here are debating the rights of people who are suffering from AIDS. We are debating, because it is a very distressing matter for all of us. Although recent years have seen progress in treatment and prevention, we now have just under five years to reach the Millennium Development Goals, in which Member States of the United Nations undertook to restrict the spread of HIV/AIDS and to reduce the number of new infections.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Meanwhile, the truth is that the number of people infected with the virus is rising. This concerns some regions in particular, and certain social groups among women and girls. Therefore, in our resolution, we declare and give strong support to three types of action. Firstly, legal measures intended to encourage countries at particular risk from AIDS to make the fight against AIDS a priority and to prepare plans for fighting the disease, including the preparation and introduction of anti-discrimination laws intended to protect those social groups which are at risk.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, we strongly emphasise educational measures. It is particularly important to ensure access to education and provision of information about HIV in order to turn discrimination into understanding and acceptance. This is important not only in developing and underdeveloped countries, but in European countries, too, it is still a painful and important question.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Apart from educational activities, we emphasise the importance of access to certain drugs. For example, in the autumn, a free trade agreement will be signed with India. One of the fundamental problems we encountered during our visit to India was when people emphasised how the country produces very cheap drugs which can help prevent and fight AIDS. When the agreement with the European Union is signed, this will be restricted, and so this issue, too, must be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, listening to Baroness Ashton’s introductory statement, I can only say that I feel I can go home. My work is done. I have rarely listened to someone on this side of the House sitting in her position that understands not only what we have done, not only what we are doing, but what we need to do to protect those who are most vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I am really pleased that the Parliament has decided to take a rights-based approach, because once you have rights, those rights can be enforced by you, by civil society acting on your behalf, or can be enforced by your government – and I speak also as Parliament’s rapporteur on the review of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, with AIDS and HIV, the numbers are growing: currently over 33 million people are living with AIDS and HIV. In 2008 alone, 2.7 million people were newly infected, most of those in sub-Saharan Africa and most – 60% – women and young children. There is quite clearly so much more we need to do. We need to empower individuals about the choices they have, about their bodies and about denying the rights that others wish to force upon them – particularly men – or those, like transgendered people, who are often sex workers and have no choice but to yield to the demands of others. That is why I am particularly pleased that we have made reference to those who are primarily affected by this.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are elevated levels of infections amongst sex workers, men who have sex with men and deny their own sexuality because of a low esteem level, transgendered people, prisoners, injecting drug users, migrant populations, refugee and mobile workers in nearly all regions. In our own near neighbourhood, Ukraine and Russia, as well as other countries, there are epidemic levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is, however, not all a negative story: the EU has led on this and will continue to lead, and I hope we will lead at the 18th Annual Conference in Vienna.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just want to say this. Behind all of those statistics of millions, imagine that there is one life affected with the reality of living with AIDS and HIV. Think of the lost generations, lost lives, lost lovers, lost parents, lost brothers and sisters, lives often lost by the loss of the other. Think of the waste – the total, abject waste of life from the preventable transmission of the HIV virus.</p>

I have to say that one of the last things that Michael Cashman just said – that this is a preventable disease – gets me very frustrated.

      <p sl="de">I will look at a couple of key words, starting with stigma. Mrs Kolarska mentioned discrimination and it was also mentioned by you, Baroness Ashton. Even within the European Union, there is still stigma. Look at the fact that within a number of Member States, for example, homosexual people are still not allowed to donate blood. Or that there are still Member States which, against all the rules and all the principles that we stand for, ask people for an HIV negative declaration before they allow them to enter the country, even within the European Union. Those are the things that we should address when we are telling other countries in the world how to behave better. So, if we welcome the lifting of the travel ban in the US, we should apply the same principles within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to stigma, there is also the problem of narrow-mindedness regarding sexual morals. I am always shocked to find that there are still people in this House who feel that they cannot endorse the kind of resolution that we will be voting tomorrow because it makes reference to sexual and reproductive health rights and sexual autonomy for women. If we simply recognised those principles and notions, and if we had the support of all the Members in this House, then we could already eliminate so much misery. I fail to understand how people can refuse to endorse these principles and still look people – mainly women, I have to say – in the eye who are suffering from these debilitating diseases. I think that autonomy and rights for women are something they have to come clean on. Recognise the fact that women are in charge of their own bodies and that they decide – not only outside the European Union, but also inside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are all things that do not cost a penny – access to medication and to adequate health services. It is basic. Within the European Union, we consider that a basic human right, which is also the theme of today’s debate. Why, then, do we deny that right to other people or consider it a privilege or a favour? No, it is a fundamental right. In addition, if you are practical, we are in the midst of an economic crisis which hits countries outside the European Union particularly. A healthy labour force is the first precondition for economic development, let us face it. Let us invest in health.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to appeal to those countries who are currently considering cuts in their budgets for development assistance and, in particular, assistance to public health. That should be one of our priorities, and we should not be talking about budget cuts. We should be talking about support to those countries, not forgetting, at the same time, to appeal to the responsibility of the national governments.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I would urge all members of all groups across this House to endorse the resolution tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will wholeheartedly support what has been said by the three colleagues from three other political groups about HIV and AIDS and I would also like to thank the High Representative for her approach to this question. The resolution that we are going to adopt tomorrow will be a very important contribution to the 18th International AIDS Conference, which will be held in Vienna later this month. There, we can indeed emphasise how important it is that the European Union is going to work with those countries who still have laws and policies which are real obstacles to taking care of people who have HIV/AIDS. These are important obstacles in the prevention of this disease. In our resolution, we state that there are still 106 countries of this kind. It is a major task in our foreign policy and our development policy to emphasise that we need evidence-based approaches to HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should deal with prejudiced ideas and discrimination that still exist. It is very sad to see that many countries still criminalise same-sexual behaviour. We have to tell these countries that it is not something that can be adopted on the basis of traditions and culture. It is about treating human beings in a decent way, it is about their rights, and the rights-based approach is the right one.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, we must repeat these statistics to everyone, after all, because they cannot be repeated enough. In 2008, there were 2.4 million new cases of people with AIDS and 2 million deaths, and the toll is rising year on year. Today, there are 33.4 million people with the disease, and that is just an estimate. Two thirds – I repeat, two thirds – of these people do not even have access to treatment. We are talking about a disease whose increased incidence is inversely proportional to the access to treatment. It is estimated that more than 22 million of the total number of people infected live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are other imbalances, too: for example, the number of women with the disease continues to be much higher than the number of male sufferers. It is now a matter of urgency, as it was yesterday and the day before that, to commit to prevention, access to treatment and a response based on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We call for the Commission and the Council to take up their stated commitments and come to view AIDS as a global priority for public health. We therefore need policies to reduce vulnerability and combat different kinds of discrimination, such as the kind faced by blood donors from infected people, even within Europe, merely because they have a sexual orientation that is different from the norm. Existing support has clearly proven inadequate, and so it is necessary to strengthen the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and to recognise that general cuts in funding for sexual and reproductive health programmes in developing countries has only aggravated this situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are proud of Europe as a champion in terms of development aid, but this champion cannot be two-faced, and that applies to all of us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to compliment Baroness Ashton for her good work in getting to grips with her brief. In the very short time she has been here today, she has acquitted herself very well.</p>
      <p sl="en">My experience of HIV/AIDS goes back to a couple of years ago, when I worked on a voluntary basis in Malawi. I saw there at first hand the devastation of HIV/AIDS amongst children, amongst adults. It is a country of 12 million people, with a life expectancy of 42 years and one of the highest prevalences of HIV/AIDS in the world, with almost three quarters of a million children suffering from HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that 86 000 people die per year from it, and another 80 000 at least get HIV/AIDS annually.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only 50% off those who need ART have access to it, so an awful lot needs to be done. Three things must be done. One, medical care: firstly to try and prevent it, secondly to treat it when it occurs. Secondly, education: so, again, people will know how to prevent it and also have a more compassionate attitude to those who have contracted it. Thirdly – and Baroness Ashton referred to this – the elimination of certain practices based on the rights of certain mere individuals within tribes who have free access to do as they will with young girls and widowed women. This has to stop, and that has to be brought home to the tribes themselves. I think through the EU, we might help in eliminating that traditional practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I also want to say that, in doing that, we need to work with the authorities on the ground. One thing I did notice in Malawi: I used to buy the paper every day, and I read several articles which were critical of NGOs because of their failure to work in conjunction with local groups. So to avoid what would be seen as intellectual or cultural colonialism, we work with the people to ensure them a better life and also to eliminate this scourge of HIV/AIDS.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very happy that we will have a common resolution, hopefully with the votes of a large majority of this Parliament, on this resolution. It is – as has been said – in the preparation of the 18th International AIDS Conference in Vienna – which is my home town – and which has as its topic, ‘right here, right now’. It is about a rights-based approach to HIV and AIDS, something that has been missing in the past. As we all know – and as has been said by all of the speakers here – that HIV and AIDS leads to the fact that people affected by it – people infected – are seen as people sidelined. They are marginalised. They are not seen as somebody who is in the mainstream of society. This is the need: to make them the focus of attention, the focus of prevention and the focus of health care.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to remind everybody that even the WTO, in its Doha Declaration in 2001 on TRIPS, made it clear that primacy of health has to come before commercial interests, which is especially important in countries like Africa, where 60% of people infected are women and girls – those who traditionally have less access to health care and have less money. So the whole issue of patenting medicine, of making medicine available for poor people – poor sections of the population – is key in the struggle against AIDS and HIV infection. As has been said before, women and girls are more affected now than at the beginning of the epidemic, when it was mostly gay men. But it is not a disease that mostly affects gay men any more. In the world context, it is mostly women and girls who are affected – and men as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I ask everybody – and I really plead to those who have not signed up for the declaration – to vote in favour tomorrow, to make it clear that sexual and reproductive health and rights are for everybody, and especially those affected by HIV and AIDS.</p>

      <p sl="sk">AIDS continues to be a deadly disease and, despite medical progress, is still killing millions of inhabitants of our planet. The HIV virus attacks the immune system in such a way that the patient sooner or later dies from another infection, for example, tuberculosis or another concurrent infection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">According to epidemiological studies, the vast majority of people are infected during unprotected sex with an infected person.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, let us be honest. If we ask who these infected persons are, then I think the answer is that they are usually male or female sex workers, who have numerous sexual contacts every day, often without using any form of protection. They then become a breeding ground for spreading the disease, and let us not be so naive as to imagine that more frequent medical checkups, for example, once a week, will solve anything.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I speak as a doctor, and I know as a professional that when you examine someone on Monday, and the next check will come a week later, they may get infected in the intervening period and then become a source of infection themselves.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another risk group, as Mr Cashman pointed out earlier, are citizens who are sex workers, often with a homosexual orientation. As we know, there exists in this community – because it is a closed and small community – there exists the practice of frequently changing partners, and it is only a matter of time before people in such a community become infected.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We therefore have to do something, and I support research into new cures. Of course, antiretrovirals are often not completely effective, and I hope that within the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Science and Research, which European science also supports, we will discover new molecules that will really bring a cure to these infected people.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I have a lot more comments here. I am in favour of us, as Europe, providing major assistance to Africa. There are millions of people, especially in the sub-Saharan region, and it is our moral duty to help Africa.</p>

      <p sl="it">That is why we must not lower our guard. That is why there needs to be more prevention, more information and more rehabilitation but, above all, more resources, and those resources need to be utilised properly. There needs to be support for families, because the problems of AIDS victims become family problems, and action needs to be taken to make a series of behaviour and lifestyle choices healthier and more appropriate. The aim is to have a measurable health result, and the specific aim is to ensure that, in time, these problems are increasingly reduced.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in recent years, the majority of new infections have affected 15 to 24 year olds. It is young people in particular who underestimate the potential risk of infection. This is a consequence of ignorance of the disease. They are too young to remember the information campaigns of the 1980s and sex education is not a mandatory component of the curriculum in schools.</p>
      <p sl="de">A Eurobarometer survey in 2005 showed that the majority of European citizens would be in favour of increased EU involvement in combating HIV/AIDS. However, this survey also reveals the problem of half-truths that are still prevalent among the population.

      <p sl="el">A second point to which we must give due attention is the fight against the social exclusion which results from making contamination known, as a result of which approximately 30% of the people in the European Union who have the virus do not know that they are carriers and this increases the risk of transmission.</p>
      <p sl="el">Given these two objectives, the virus must be fought as a global health priority. The Commission and the Council must take responsible action and promote financing for programmes. That is crucial. The emphasis must be put on guiding and informing young people and, finally, public awareness must be increased and the public must be properly informed, so that the risk of social exclusion is significantly reduced.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to assure you as well that we will maintain and increase our dedication to defending these rights inside Europe, but also as part of our relations with third countries, whether they are close to our borders or on other continents. Unfortunately, I will be in the Middle East, so I will not be able to participate in the Vienna conference, but my colleague, Commissioner Dalli, who of course carries a portfolio for health and consumer policy, will represent the European Commission and will speak at the opening session of the conference.</p>

      <p sl="en">If I may, I will conclude my remarks by doing something that honourable Members have also done in this debate. My personal story of this starts by remembering that there has been an important football match in South Africa tonight. I recall that when I was in South Africa a few years ago, I was taken for a drive outside of Johannesburg up into the country. The person driving me was talking about the problems of HIV and AIDS in South Africa – an issue which has been taken up by many people and not least by someone I have had the privilege of working with, Annie Lennox, the singer.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we drove through the countryside the driver said, ‘pick a village, pick any village that you like in the next hour’. We drove along and I said I saw many villages but I would choose that one. I pointed to a village, we drove into the village and he drove me to the graveyard. He said that in Africa, the tradition is that you do not lay the headstone for one year after the death of a person, so any crosses that you see, small crosses, represent people who have died within the last year. I went to this graveyard and there were hundreds of them. He said to me very simply: those are the victims of AIDS.</p>

In Malta, the importers of medicinal products and the Nationalist Parliamentary Secretary have agreed to reduce the price of 63 medicinal products. It is astounding when there are over 3 000 medicinal products that are distributed in Malta. This means that only 2% have actually been targeted. Amongst the medicines which have been reduced in price, two were taken as examples forwarded to the Commission comparing the exorbitant prices in Malta and Belgium. Zocor 20mg has been reduced, but it is still 240% more expensive in Malta than it is in Belgium. From the other examples provided, all remain more expensive in Malta, the highest being Tegretol 200 mg, which is 150% higher in price, and Lexotan 3 mg – 113% higher. The lowest is Actonel 35, which is 20% higher in Malta. The fact that medicines have started to decrease in price, although not enough, only illustrates how right we have been not to accept the excuses put forward by a number of medicine providers.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the entry into force on 1 August 2010 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and the role of the EU (2010/2772(RSP)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to discuss the issue of cluster munitions. I believe this is an important moment to do so, less than one month before the entry into force of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As this House knows, this Convention, originally a Norwegian initiative, will prohibit all use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions. Similarly to anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions pose – as honourable Members know – a serious threat to the lives of civilians by causing indiscriminate damage, particularly affecting children.</p>
      <p sl="en">The very nature of cluster munitions goes against basic humanitarian principles. Not only do they release small bomblets over a wide area with indiscriminate effects, they also leave behind a large amount of unexploded ordnance that can explode at any time, even decades after a conflict has ended. That is why the European Union is committed to making every effort to achieve a complete ban on these deadly devices.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Convention on Cluster Munitions was agreed in December 2008. In only a year and a half, 106 states have signed the convention and 36 have ratified it. In a way that reminds us of the inspiring dynamic triggered by the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Landmines, we can expect significant progress in our common efforts to reduce – and eventually eliminate – the production, use and transfer of cluster munitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union as a whole is fully committed to tackling the impact of cluster munitions on civilian populations through all possible means. Although not all EU Member States are party to the convention, there is a general understanding that the EU can, and must, play an active role in this area. As this House knows, the EU also continues to support the wider negotiation of an additional protocol on cluster munitions to the UN Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons. The aim here is to expand the body of international norms spanning this category of weapons and to reach out to a large number of countries. I think we can be very clear on this point. The Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons is a UN Convention and therefore, a truly multilateral instrument, negotiated in the widest forum. Its provisions, and those of its additional protocols, contribute to reducing the suffering of combatants and civilian populations in areas of conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore very important that the EU supports this convention and its protocols. This is exactly what we have been doing since 2007 through a specific EU joint action that supports the universalisation of the convention and its full implementation. In the negotiations on the additional protocol on cluster munitions, the EU is pleading for a prohibition and not only a restriction of the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of certain cluster munitions that cause particular humanitarian concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recognise that the scope of this protocol could not be as wide as the Convention on Cluster Munitions, but if we could achieve a protocol in the UN context with wider participation – in particular, with the participation of those states that produce and have stocks of these weapons – it would help us to get closer to our objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the next steps on the Convention on Cluster Munitions as such, I am pleased that preparations have begun for the first states-party meeting, which will take place in Laos in November 2010. The Santiago conference in June already demonstrated a high level of commitment from large numbers of states, as indeed was the case for representatives of civil society. Many EU Member States played a very active role as Friends of the Chair in the discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to concrete assistance to third countries, let me emphasise that the European Union has been very active. We assist third countries in getting rid of their stockpile of cluster munitions, we help them to clear affected areas, and we provide assistance to the victims in countries such as Afghanistan, Laos, Cambodia, Lebanon or Sudan. Over the last 10 years, the European Union has devoted more than EUR 300 million to its work in the field of anti-personnel landmines and explosive remnants of war – including, sadly, the daily threat posed by cluster munitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much look forward to this debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, thank you, Baroness Ashton, for your sympathetic words. I agree wholeheartedly with what you have said and believe that we should emphasise what the European Union has achieved in the area of eliminating these weapons.</p>
      <p sl="de">War and civil war are always the worst case scenario, particularly for the people affected by them. However, within this worst case scenario, there is another type of weapon which is even more perfidious, and which has a particularly destructive, long-term effect, namely cluster munitions.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is important that we should be able to state that this convention will come into force on 1 August, on the one hand, while, on the other, taking this as the right opportunity for the European Parliament to play a special role by putting our own house in order, specifically by calling on those Member States who have not yet signed or ratified this convention to do so as soon as possible, let us say, by the end of the year. Although it would have been wonderful, I assume that we will not manage this by 1 August, because some national parliaments are already in recess.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have touched on another point, namely, the demand that the European Union, which is now a legal personality, should sign up to this convention. Perhaps this is a way to encourage the remaining Member States to take the same step on a bilateral basis. I hope that in this way, we will soon make the European Union and its Member States into an example for third countries, encouraging them to destroy their stocks and to eliminate cluster munitions in the countries where they still exist as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, cluster munitions destroy lives and the environment in a disproportionate and immoral way, without distinguishing between military and civilian targets in theatres of armed conflict. The idea that these arms provide security for the states that own them is false and backward and violates international humanitarian law and interferes with global security. Moreover, the principal victims of these weapons are developing countries and their people.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Convention on Cluster Munitions obliges States Parties to gradually destroy their stockpiled weapons and to be responsible for disposing of unexploded munitions and for protecting and supporting their victims. The convention enters into force on 1 August, but only 11 EU Member States have ratified it so far. It is urgent that all Member States do so, so that we can make an effective contribution to curbing the use, sale and transfer of these weapons everywhere and succeed in prohibiting and eliminating them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another nine EU Member States have already expressed their approval of the convention, but they have yet to ratify it. My country, Portugal, was one of those that allowed itself to become bound up in lengthy legislation after signing the convention in December 2008. Almost two years later, the Assembly of the Republic has still not been called upon to give their decision. This tardiness is all the more embarrassing given that Portugal is positively committed to promoting the convention alongside other Portuguese-speaking countries, and now Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde have announced their ratification for August, when the convention enters into force, before Portugal itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These delays in ratifying the convention are unacceptable. This is why we are also asking the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Mrs Ashton, to speed up the process so that the European Union can accede to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union must be at the forefront of this process, and the seven Member States which have not even signed the Convention must be called to account. This resolution by the European Parliament, whereby we name them, is a step towards this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, cluster bombs have killed and injured thousands of civilians during the last 40 years and sadly continue to do so today. We must remember that a third of all recorded cluster munitions casualties are children. Take the case of a Vietnamese girl helping her father with the gardening one day. She was the victim of a cluster bomb and lost both her legs. The tragedy is that she was considered lucky: four out of ten cluster bomb accidents result in death.</p>
      <p sl="de">After years of campaigning, we finally now have a convention which can help to deliver change. It is absolutely vital, first and foremost, that all EU Member States sign and ratify the convention as a matter of urgency. Sadly, as Mrs Gomes says and as this resolution states, only 11 Member States have ratified the convention so far.</p>
      <p sl="de">As we move towards the entry into force of this convention on 1 August, I would like to see a concerted effort by Parliament and the Commission to convince all EU Member States to sign and ratify it. EU Member States that have signed should work quickly to put into place national legislation to implement it and destroy their stockpiles, as Spain has already done.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2002, I was Parliament’s rapporteur for its report on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2006. The EU will soon sign this landmark convention. It will be a total contradiction if we then failed to take action on cluster bombs. Looking to the future, it is important as well that the Commission and the Council include a ban on cluster munitions in a standard clause in agreements with third countries. I would like to hear the High Representative’s plans to take this forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">The convention also establishes a new humanitarian standard for the assistance of victims in Article 5, calling for guidelines and good practice, including in the areas of medical care, rehabilitation and psychological support. Also important, as the High Representative has mentioned, is the clearance of the millions of unexploded cluster munition remnants that are left behind after conflicts. Article 6 of the convention calls for each country to provide assistance for clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and information concerning various means and technologies related to the clearance of those munitions.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must do all we can to save the lives of thousands who have yet to be killed and injured and to help those who have been. We know enough about the horrific effects of these weapons to know that even those who have not signed the convention should never ever use them again. I urge you all to support this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, my first encounter with the issue of cluster munitions was more than four years ago, when a group of civil society organisations approached the Austrian Parliament, of which I was then a Member, asking us to organise an event around the issue in order to get the convention off the ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">The group included victims, people who themselves had lost a leg or had suffered other serious health problems because of cluster munitions. They showed us photographs illustrating what happens when a bomb of this type detonates. Hundreds of tiny, coloured fragments are produced that are then left lying about, possibly for years – hence the term cluster munitions. Children playing on the site at a later time can be attracted by the bright colours, picking the fragments up only for them to explode in their hand, causing them to lose an arm or a leg.</p>
      <p sl="de">This made such an impression on me that I started a campaign in Austria and I can say that, after some initial resistance, my country was one of the first to sign and ratify the convention. That is all very well, but so many of the Member States of the European Union have still not signed up. I am very pleased that we have succeeded in convincing a majority – five groups – to support this resolution, particularly because I know, Mr Gahler, that there were some points of concern within your group. I would also like to thank you for agreeing to the naming of the Member States who have not yet signed and ratified the convention and who are not yet prepared actually to destroy their stockpiles and to declare that they will never use these weapons again.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, I have two specific questions for you: the demand that the EU should sign up to this convention as a legal entity and that, in all negotiations with third countries, you should add the prohibition of cluster bombs and cluster munitions to the standard clause which already includes the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I would ask that you answer these questions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank the previous speakers for their contributions, which I expressly support.</p>
      <p sl="de">As already explained, cluster munitions are indeed among the most brutal weapons in existence. They were certainly still in use by some EU Member States and the USA until recently. I could mention the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. It is quite shocking that – as has already been stated – statistically, the victims of cluster bombs and cluster munitions are 98% civilians, 27% of whom are children.</p>
      <p sl="de">How are we to view the prospects for the continued use of these weapons? It is certainly remarkable that Deutsche Bank is investing in the production of these dreadful weapons through its subsidiaries. It has been proven that business relations exist between Deutsche Bank and leading suppliers and manufacturers of cluster munitions, including L-3 Communications and Lockheed Martin. I find it shameless and inhumane to knowingly seek to make money from the death of civilians. The use, production, storage and transport of these weapons must be prohibited; the same goes for the trade in such weapons.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, all EU Member States, along with all other countries, must sign and ratify the agreement on cluster munitions in full by August of this year or, if this is not possible, as Mr Gahler has stated, they must do so at the earliest possible opportunity. There should also be a moratorium on the use, production and distribution of cluster munitions until the agreement is ratified and work should begin as quickly as possible to destroy the existing stockpiles of cluster munitions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very pleased with this cross-party cooperation and support for the agreement on cluster munitions in the form of this joint resolution and welcome it on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. We believe that this resolution represents a major success in the fight against these murderous weapons.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, indeed, as my honourable friends have said, only 11 Member States out of 27 have ratified this very important convention banning the use, production, storage and transportation of cluster munitions. No one disagrees that our ambition must be for all the Member States to ratify this convention.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, the question arises as to why the other Member States have not yet ratified the convention, despite the fact that it enters into force on 1 August. The main causes are reasons of national security and, to a great extent, in certain instances, they are justified, especially where neighbouring states outside the European Union are demonstrating increased aggression.</p>
      <p sl="el">Therefore, to close, if we really want all the Member States to ratify this convention and to have the maximum possible results in these very important Union policies, we must also convince neighbouring countries demonstrating tension and aggression to move in the same direction, especially those who want to join our European family.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Cluster munitions are among the most dangerous weapons for civilians because they are used over extensive areas against scattered, mobile targets that are difficult to see.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As has already been said, up to 98% of the victims are people not involved in military conflict, in other words, civilians. A large proportion of them – 27% – are also children.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In addition, perhaps 30% of cluster bombs do not explode but remain in the earth in the form of mines, posing a danger to civilians long after the conflict has ended.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Despite these sad statistics, many Member States of the European Union have not signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which bans their production, storage and use, because they follow their own economic – and this is very sad – their own economic interests in relation to the production and export of these munitions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I profoundly disagree with such an approach, and I believe that humanitarian interests and the protection of civilians should come first.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, it is therefore the task of the European Union to put pressure on all states, and particularly on EU Member States, to sign and ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this evening, we have spent some time discussing what you might call the dark side of modern life. A few moments ago, we were discussing the destruction of life throughout the world because of HIV/AIDS; now we have the same destruction of innocent civilians by cluster munitions. It is good I suppose, with new instruments being made available with the Lisbon Treaty, through Baroness Ashton as High Representative, to at least try and bring solutions for these terrible problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we will have to put our own house in order first and, as the speakers have said, only 11 of the 27 have signed the convention, which is not good enough. So the High Representative will have to use her influence to ask the others: ‘Why not?’ Then try to eliminate the barriers to their signing up.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only then can we move forward with what we spoke about today, the European Union speaking with one voice to the rest of the world. If we cannot speak with one voice by putting our own house in order first, how can we go to the rest of the world saying that a new Lisbon Treaty has created new instruments and that we are going to lead in terms of giving a good example all around the world? So, put our house in order first, and then we can deal with the rest of the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this has been a very important debate, and I have taken note of your remarks and, of course, your concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me begin by saying that the European Union will maintain its engagement to attain a complete ban on cluster munitions through our active political outreach in the framework both of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. We will also continue to provide international cooperation and assistance by mainstreaming our activities against cluster munitions in our development and in our cooperation policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I might address two or three of the key points that have also been raised in this debate. First of all, the decision on accession to the convention by the European Union in the post-Lisbon era, of course, depends on the Member States, because it comes within their remit. Members are absolutely right to raise that as an issue that we will need to consider very carefully.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I can say, though, that the position, as I understand it, of a number of Member States is that we have 11 Member States who have ratified as well as signed the convention, but we have a further eight Member States who have signed it but not yet ratified it – so that is 19 Member States – and therefore eight Member States who have done neither at this stage. Members have made their positions very clear in wanting to see as many EU Member States as possible continue to take forward both the ratification and the signing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to address briefly the point that Ms Lynne made about assistance to third countries and, as I said in my earlier remarks, the importance of bringing what we do to support third countries as part of the mainstreaming of our policies – this whole post-Lisbon opportunity – to bring together different policies. We want to continue actively, through the external action instruments that we have, to contribute to the disposal of unexploded ordnances, anti-personnel mines and abandoned ammunition stocks precisely for the reasons, as Ms Lunacek vividly described, of what happens when these brightly coloured bomblets appear on the ground. There are many cases, particularly of children who have been devastated either by the loss of limbs or, occasionally, loss of life as a consequence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We mostly make use of our geographical instruments in response to the needs that are expressed by our partner countries, and we also make use of the humanitarian aid instruments, for example, in Lebanon or Sri Lanka, and also to make sure that we are dealing with issues on emerging crises as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have mentioned that we spend about EUR 330 million in our commitment to support countries that have been directly affected by mines and cluster munitions. I described Afghanistan, where we have spent EUR 22 million, and Lebanon (EUR 7 million), and future projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Laos and Cambodia are under preparation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to make the point that, although I have given that figure, it is difficult to quantify the exact figures for our programmes, and the reason is that during operations on the ground, we do not make distinctions between what we clear. The point is that we clear it and that, I hope, will be well understood by Members.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final point I wanted to make is that we are trying to ensure that we assist and support the timely signature and ratification of the convention by Member States. We have coordination meetings among EU disarmament experts which take place every month, and the issue of the universality of the convention, as well as the state of preparedness of what I described earlier as the first states-party meeting, are regularly discussed. We have decided to contribute to the greatest extent possible to the preparatory committee to be held in September in Geneva, in order to ensure that we get good progress when we have that first states-party meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">Though the hour is late, this has been an extremely important debate and I am very grateful for the contributions that have been made.</p>
