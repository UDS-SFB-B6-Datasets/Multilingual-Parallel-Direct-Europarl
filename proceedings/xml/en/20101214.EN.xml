      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Gál, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2009) – effective implementation after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (2009/2161(INI) (A7-0344/2010).</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon brought with it the vision and idea of a strong Europe in respect of Community powers. To the citizens, it offers the promise of the fulfilment of this vision. This also applies to the protection of fundamental rights, and therefore, in contrast to previous years, this year’s report deals with these new legal bases and with the strengthened and newly established powers and institutions, and provides a close examination of the situation thus created. The aim of the report is to offer a new and comprehensive approach in the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Since December 2009, the protection of fundamental human rights has rested on multiple pillars within the European Union. On one hand, it is based on the Treaty of Lisbon, and on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has now become legally binding. The Charter has become a standard for the creation and application of EU laws by both the EU institutions and by the Member States. A similar pillar of the Community legal system will be our accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, a process that is currently under way, but the system of human rights guarantees enshrined in the Member States’ own legal systems will remain a similar pillar. These legal bases will also be reinforced by the established Community institutions, both at Community and Member State level. At Community level, I would like to mention the Commission, the portfolio of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, the Council working group, Parliament, and of the agencies, I would like to highlight the role of the Agency for Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The aim of my report is to raise awareness in order to ensure that these existing institutions and mechanisms operate in an efficient and transparent way, whether in the monitoring of decision making or legislation, data collection, or information transfer, and that they do not accord priority to some rights while neglecting others. It is important that the individual institutions not only report, but also respond to and comment on each other. They should make use of, and build upon, each other’s work in the field of the protection of human rights, and should take their decisions coherently, objectively, and on the basis of facts.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thus, in this report, we reviewed what Parliament expects from these institutions. We commented on the Commission communication issued in October, which follows a similar concept. One of the principal aims of the report is to emphasise that the current fundamental rights structure must begin and end with the individual, that is to say, the citizen. This means that we must provide citizens with sufficient information to ensure that they are aware of and understand their opportunities and are able to make use of them. The system of protection of fundamental rights must be comprehensible, accessible and effectively useful, as the entire structure is only worth as much as the citizens of the EU can assert from it. In achieving these goals, the aforementioned institutions and the Member States must assume a balancing role to ensure that the EU can increase its credibility in the eyes of the citizens. Finally, my report focuses on those areas which not only require rapid action but also medium to long-term strategies, such as the integration of the Roma, the fight against child poverty and the issue of language use among minority communities, to name but a few.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I hope that with the report that will be adopted tomorrow, we will be able to send a readily comprehensible and clear message to the aforementioned institutions: to the Commission, the Council, the agencies, the Member States’ bodies and courts, so we can make this system even more effective. In this, I request your support for tomorrow so that in the post-Treaty of Lisbon period, now that the foundations, the institutions, are already in place, we can act in this spirit.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the debate today on the fundamental rights situation in the European Union is very important, not only because it comes 10 years after the proclamation of the charter – the anniversary of the charter was at the beginning of this month – but also because it is the first discussion in Parliament dedicated to that which the rapporteur, Ms Gál, calls the ‘new post-Lisbon fundamental rights architecture’. She is absolutely right. We have started with a new beginning for the meaning of human rights and fundamental rights in Europe. I would like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their very valuable contribute to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now have a legally binding charter which is part of the EU’s primary legislation. What we need to do now is to put the charter into practice. It was precisely for this reason that, in October, the Commission adopted a communication on the strategy for the effective implementation of the charter. The key objective for the Commission here is to make the rights enshrined in the charter as effective as possible for the benefit of all the people living in the EU and, as Members of this House, you represent those people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The charter must be our compass and we must lead by example, in particular, when we legislate. This applies to the Commission’s internal preparation work and to adoption by the European Parliament and the Council, as well as to the application of the new rules by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has enforced a systematic assessment of the fundamental rights impact of new legislative proposals through a fundamental rights checklist to be used by all Commission departments. I am pleased to see that Ms Gál’s report supports this approach. It highlights, in particular, how important it is for the European Parliament and for the Council to pay attention to compliance with the charter throughout the legislative process. Not only must the text on the table comply with the charter, but the effects of later amendments to that text must be taken into account as well. Each institution therefore needs to think about how to ensure that amendments to legislative proposals are properly assessed. I welcome the call in the report for improved cooperation among the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to see how the charter is applied when Member States implement EU law. I would like to reiterate in this House that I will not shy away from starting infringement proceedings whenever necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also highlights the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights. The speedy accession of the European Union to the Convention is a high priority for the Commission. Negotiations are well under way, and are moving forward in a swift and constructive manner. If everything goes well, as seems to be the case, I hope that we will be able to reach a final agreement in the first half of 2011. So things are moving quickly and they are moving well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also fully share the objective of ensuring smooth cooperation with international organisations. We do this as a matter of course, on a daily basis. The Commission already takes into account the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child when it prepares new proposals which can affect children. Recently, we also had a discussion about the disabled, and it is clear that in that field, too, we are applying the United Nations Convention in the Member States and at European Union level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur spoke about the Agency for Fundamental Rights, which has a key role to play in providing us with comparable and reliable data on the situation in the 27 Member States in areas where the EU can act. There, too, we want to work not only in theory but in practice. I have, for instance, asked the agency to contribute to the work of the Roma task force. The Commission is in favour of extending the mandate of the agency to ensure that it can also provide its expertise in the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. To make this possible, on 2 December, the Commission adopted a proposal to amend the multiannual framework, which lists the thematic areas in which the agency can work.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should now like to move on to something new, which I think tallies perfectly with the rapporteur’s line, and that is the momentum created by the Lisbon Treaty which we have to uphold. With this in mind, in spring 2011, the Commission will publish its first annual report on the application of the charter. The idea is for this to be published as an annual report every spring. I believe this would be the time for Parliament to come in and provoke a real debate on how the charter is being applied in practice. When we prepare our first annual report on the application of the charter in spring 2011, I will pay particular attention to the European Parliament’s report, and to Parliament’s other fundamental rights activities. This will not only allow us to hold a debate on human rights outside the European Union, as is customary in this House, but it will also allow us to hold a yearly debate on fundamental rights and how they are applied by the different governments inside the European Union, as well as to see whether the European institutions are doing their jobs as they should be.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Kinga Gál for her report and, in particular, for the focus she placed on such an important subject, that is, the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union and its implementation. I believe that Kinga Gál’s concentration on this issue was crucial this year. I would like to make a point on how important it is that we keep considering human rights as fundamental human rights, because sometimes I fear that not everyone interprets the concept of fundamental rights in the same manner. First of all, it must be made clear that human rights do not mean that we should ignore the concept of, say, subsidiarity, or that we should trample upon the different values that Member States embrace. Unfortunately, there are some who are attempting to manipulate the issue of fundamental rights to do just that. The European Union should leave it up to the Member States to deal with ethical issues such as euthanasia and abortion. Secondly, we should take care to ensure that fundamental rights are indeed fundamental rights and do not include other rights which, albeit important, are not fundamental and therefore risk being unrealistic when viewed in today’s context. A case in point would be the rights that are connected to immigration issues, which are of considerable importance, yet are not always fundamental rights. Finally, we must seek to adopt reasonable positions on, for example, security and the importance of data protection. Therefore, to conclude, I believe that we need fundamental rights, yet at the same time, we must ensure that they are both logical and realistic.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, as I think she has managed to fulfil the main aim of the report, which is specifically to clarify the roles which individual institutions and mechanisms will play in the new post-Lisbon architecture of fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I consider three areas contained in the report to be of key importance. It is important for the Union to defend not only the rights of its citizens, or the people on its territory, but also to become a global leader in this area. The newly-established European External Action Service can play a key role from this perspective. I would therefore like to call on the Commission to ensure that the structure, resources and activities of the diplomatic service are established in such a way that European diplomacy can effectively promote fundamental rights abroad as well.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Secondly, following Lisbon, democracy and human rights have a new expression via the European Citizens’ Initiative. The initiative boosts the role of EU citizens, who can use it to initiate the adoption of European legislation. Thirdly, I would like to express my satisfaction over the fact that the report calls on EU Member States and institutions to redouble their efforts on raising public awareness of fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for being responsive to our comments, and for the fact that the report also contains the explicit reference we requested to the fight against poverty and social exclusion in the section mentioning the activities necessary for the protection of fundamental rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, tomorrow afternoon, we will be able to share our thoughts on the human rights situation in the world, but this morning, we are focusing on the state of play as regards these rights in the European Union. Discussing the European Union first and the rest of the world afterwards is the right order in my view because, before criticising others, we should put our own house in order. If we really want to be taken seriously, we must not turn a blind eye to human rights violations on our own soil.</p>
      <p sl="de">This resolution, for which I want to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms Gál, focuses on the way forward for EU policy in the field of human rights protection and advancement after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. It deals not only with who bears responsibility for what, but also focuses on the topics that should be at the centre of our concern in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would just like to emphasise two aspects. I was happy with the support given in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the idea of a kind of freezing mechanism, by which national contested policies or decisions can be frozen by the Commission until it has taken a formal decision as to whether to start the infringement procedure. I believe such a mechanism will bring added value in creating a more credible fundamental rights policy within the European Union. I hope, therefore, that the entire House will lend its support to this mechanism when we vote tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other aspect relates to the right and the duty of this Parliament continually to analyse the human rights situation in the Member States and to be critical in expressing its views, including naming and shaming when necessary.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is a very good report, and the first one after the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, for her hard work, receptiveness and fruitful cooperation. I would like to come back to four messages contained in this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first concerns our requirement for the Commission to fulfil its role with respect to the new resources at its disposal and to the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The situation of the Roma people has sadly been the first practical case, and the Commission has, in the end, only gone halfway on this matter, basing itself solely on the Free Movement Directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has sidestepped the non-discrimination issue on the basis of Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but it cannot be so half-hearted in future, with the ratification, by the Union, of the European Convention on Human Rights, and I am delighted to see the Union’s commitment to seeing this through.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The added value of this report also resides in the fact that it emphasises the need for early detection of potential violations through the implementation of a warning system. This system makes provision, among other things, for measures suspected of constituting such violations to be suspended while the accelerated procedure for determining whether they are contrary to fundamental rights is carried out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also insist on the need to set up a prevention system on the model, for example, of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism within the United Nations Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes, as you have already mentioned, Mrs Reding. In that respect, the signing of EU readmission agreements represents a real challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are blindly endorsing these agreements when the actual terms of their implementation are being decided in joint committees from which Parliament is excluded.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, now that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has become legally binding in Europe, we are dealing with two systems for the protection of human rights which are, to a certain extent, in competition with one another. One of these systems is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the case-law of the Court of Justice, and the other is based on the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. I think the fundamental challenge identified in the Gál report is that of ensuring coherence between these systems, both in terms of content and in institutional terms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Charter of Fundamental Rights must not be interpreted in such a way that it results in the presumption of new competences for the European Union. Article 51 states this very clearly, but I think it is worth reminding everyone, particularly the Members of this House, that issues relating to marital law, criminal law and the legal protection of unborn life cannot be regulated at EU level, either directly or by the actions of any court or tribunal. This politicisation of human rights protection instruments can lead to only one thing – a fall in trust in the international judiciary.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like, in turn, to thank our rapporteur for her willingness to listen and for her work, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the quality of this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For us, this report is important because it draws conclusions from one of the few positive outcomes of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, if it is effectively implemented. Indeed, the effective implementation of fundamental rights in the European Union is an important, if not fundamental, issue for the European Union’s future. However, using flowery language will not be enough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, soon, accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, will provide us with new tools in this area and will enable the European Union and its Members to reach a new stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many say that human rights are part of the European Union’s essential values but few recognise them as being truly universal and indivisible. Indivisible, meaning that all the human rights enshrined in the Charter, but also in the European Convention, and in all the European and international conventions that stem from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, have the same value, whatever they may be.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Civil and political rights are no more important than economic and social rights. The right to live in dignity is just as important as religious freedom for instance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Universal means that human rights are the same for everyone, regardless of their nationality, regardless of their legal status. However, we know that the right to education and the right to family life, here too for instance, are constantly flouted in nearly every Member State. The situation regarding the Roma people is unfortunately symptomatic of this. So yes, the Commission must resolve to start infringement proceedings and to be as strict as it is on economic matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Universal also implies that human rights have the same value throughout the world, meaning that the European Union must attach the same importance to human rights as it does to economic or diplomatic issues in its foreign policy and partnership agreements. This is not the case in countries such as Tunisia, Libya and Colombia, and I could mention many more. So yes, this is a fundamental issue; the European Union’s credibility and the future of its foreign policy are at stake.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, as a Hungarian and a female politician, I am proud that it was a Hungarian female Member, Mrs Kinga Gál, who created with considerable effort this very significant work on a better assertion of human rights, and brought it before the European Union. For this, I would like to thank her.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What I find lacking, however, is an emphasis on traditional civil and political liberties, and there is hardly anyone in a better position here in the EU than we, Hungarians, to emphasise that in the European Union, the problem does not only lie with discrimination against minorities or the integration of the Roma when it comes to human rights, but with the freedom of expression, assembly and speech, and nothing illustrates this better than the situation in Hungary between 2002 and 2010. The Human Rights Committee of the Hungarian Parliament recently adopted a very thorough and detailed report, which demonstrates through court judgments, reports of the ombudsman and other means that the Hungarian socialist governments between 2002 and 2010 maintained their power by grossly and continuously violating human rights. My question to the rapporteur, on the one hand, is whether this particular Hungarian report can finally be presented to the European Union in the current situation, and whether the European Union will investigate it, because that would indeed be a realistic indication that there has been some measure of change in the field of human rights. On the other hand, if we are able to speak of an increased possibility to assert human rights in the European Union at all, how could we better avoid incidents like the one where people were shot in the eye in Hungary in 2006, particularly if the Vice-President of the LIBE Committee is still an individual who, at that time, was a member of a government that had people shot in the eye?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one can only remark favourably on a report such as the one so ably put together by the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, which has the strong point of describing the situation regarding the implementation of fundamental rights both accurately and in detail.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to raise a few minor points regarding the implementation itself. Thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now obligatory, and the Lisbon Process, which cannot now be halted, there is no doubt that this support for wellbeing and the person derives from a set of values that is truly shared, as is shown in tangible terms by the real results achieved.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, we must bear in mind the Treaty of Lisbon, the Stockholm Programme, and fundamental principles such as solidarity, integration and the fight against organised crime and terrorism. We must bear in mind that the principle of subsidiarity obviously cannot stand in the way of the implementation of fundamental rights in a Europe of the people.</p>
      <p sl="it">A few days from now, we shall approve a new dossier and the new regulation regarding the legislative initiative in favour of citizens against the trafficking of human beings. These dossiers are integrated with each other and definitely form an updated legal frame of reference. All the measures have a precise objective: to value human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that the power to make checks and apply real sanctions must be properly implemented in 2013, the European Year of Citizenship. This could certainly be an important factor to really assess the significance of the measure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, pre-Lisbon, post-Lisbon, we have very little to be proud of. In Europe, you can still be discriminated against if you are a woman. We have heard it said here in the Chamber today: a woman cannot choose what to do with her body. You can be discriminated against on the grounds of age, disability, religion, belief, sexual orientation. On the supply of goods and services, there is no movement on the Council directive. If you are in a same-sex partnership or a civil partnership or a marriage, you can be discriminated against by a Member State on the precept of the concept of subsidiarity. On that basis, you can promote inequality.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a two-speed Europe where some people are equal and others are not. We sit here and do nothing while we see rising xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and transphobia and, yes, look at what is happening to the Roma.</p>
      <p sl="en">Have we learnt nothing from the Second World War? Have we learnt nothing from the 1930s when we turned away and did nothing because people were different from us? Can we not see that religion, decent religion, is being used as an excuse to increase discrimination against LGBT people in particular? Can we not see that to diminish the rights of another is ultimately to diminish our own? We have nothing to be proud of.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is patently clear that the Treaty of Lisbon takes a different approach to fundamental rights from that we have previously been used to. First of all, of course, because of the European Union’s accession to the European Court of Human Rights, which has brought about a strange situation in which courts are competing with each other. It is still unclear exactly what turn things will take in this respect. I fear that, with the EU’s accession to the ECHR, we may have landed in a legal minefield. Could the Commissioner comment on this?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second point concerns the lasting impact of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on European law. I have a specific question for the Commissioner concerning a judgment handed down on 9 November 2010 by the Court of Justice of the European Union. This is about the joined cases of Volker and Hartmut Eifert, under references C 92/09 and C 93/09. In brief, these cases were about the right to privacy versus the right of public access to European funding streams.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In these judgments, the Court decided that the right to privacy outweighs the general European transparency interest. I was very surprised by this judgment and I would very much like to know the Commissioner’s point of view on this matter, in the context of the lasting impact of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter on current and future EU legislation.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Gál, on preparing a good report. It is true that we have a new situation in the European Union as far as the protection of human rights is concerned. It seems to me that freedom is expanding and that that is a good thing. The report is quite contemporary, or modern; it even speaks of a third generation of human rights and the like.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, protecting human rights and freedoms also includes righting the wrongs of the past.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We may have highlighted many third generation rights, as they are called, in this report, but we have forgotten some issues, such as returning property that was confiscated by totalitarian regimes to its owners or giving a dignified burial to the many people who were brutally killed in Central and Eastern Europe in 1945 and only given makeshift graves.</p>
      <p sl="sl">For that reason, we, the present generation of political decision makers, are responsible for righting these wrongs of the past. Only then will we be able to speak with a clear conscience about new, third generation human rights and freedoms, as they are called, for the present and for the future, too.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, with the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has also become legally binding, and it created the possibility for infringement procedures to be launched in the case of its violation. In some Member States, the social tensions that have arisen in the wake of the crisis have brought about a restriction of democratic rights, instead of steps having been taken in this direction. They have brought about the restriction of the freedom of the media, the restriction of the right to strike, the circumvention and limitation of social dialogue, the strengthening of discrimination, and the shattering of the foundations of the rule of law and legal certainty. The Commission, in its role as the guardian of the treaties, has an obligation to be mindful of such signs. We believe that the creation of the portfolio of a Commissioner for fundamental rights is an important step, and we call on Mrs Reding to regularly monitor the Member States and call attention to cases where fundamental rights and the basic principles of democracy are violated, in order to ensure that these are not only mandatory for candidate countries before their accession, but also later on, as the failure to do so would further undermine the credibility of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Kinga Gál for her report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We currently have a community of values and principles, reflected in a complex system of human rights protection, which includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the most progressive regional code of human rights. Member States must abide by the Charter’s provisions when applying EU legislation. The Charter’s provisions can be applied directly by national courts, thereby also giving them great responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, we have the European Convention and the case-law of the Court of Justice in Strasbourg. They provide a guarantee for individual rights in Member States. The European Union’s accession to the Convention will ensure that the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights is also applied to the actions taken by the EU as an institution and by a Member State which applies EU legislation. We certainly must monitor closely the reform of the Court in Strasbourg and its impact on shortening proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thirdly, at national level, Member States have the duty and opportunity to implement directly the provisions which guarantee fundamental rights, to apply them in their own countries through the decisions of their own institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Therefore, both legal and institutional mechanisms exist. The keyword is implementation, which must be rapid and effective for victims. Another keyword is coordination between the institutions which deliberate on the violation of rights and award damages.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into EU law does not extend the scope of the EU’s competences and complies with the principle of subsidiarity, since the Charter is an integral part of EU policy. I therefore call once again upon the Polish authorities to meet their obligations and adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Poland’s opt-out from the Charter has no substantive justification. It is a political decision which compromises my country and is detrimental to Polish citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Adoption of the Charter is particularly important in the context of the upcoming Polish Presidency. All Europeans must have equal rights, regardless of where they live and the extent to which their country is in thrall to the clergy. Unfortunately, even the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland does not always understand this. In my opinion, respect for the rights of women, the only majority to be discriminated against, is particularly important. I therefore call once again for a European directive on violence against women, including sexual and reproductive violence, as practised by certain Member States with the full sanction of domestic law.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the forward-looking part of the report has already been pointed out by many of my fellow Members. Finally, we have a report that encompasses the various issues related to human rights without giving preference to one area to the detriment of another. I am particularly pleased that that the report specifically highlights non-discrimination and equal opportunities. The report is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is the point of my speech. Adherence to, and enforcement of, the Charter can only be successful if European society recognises that all human beings are equal, and that this equality can only be realised through equal treatment. If anyone is put at a disadvantage in any respect through no fault of their own, they must be given appropriate and proportionate assistance so that they can become persons of equal value, citizens of equal value. The road that leads to this goal is a difficult one, and deliberate work will be required to complete it. Mrs Gál’s report is a significant milestone along this road. I am grateful for her very significant work.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to point out one danger. The combination of different forms of combating discrimination may lead to discrimination. There was also talk of this at the OSCE meeting last week in Vienna.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is a paradox, but as anti-discrimination policy becomes an ideology, people begin to discriminate. We see how the actual concept of discrimination goes beyond its definition. If the European Union has any serious shortcomings in this area, it is in the need to restore the original meaning of the word ‘discrimination’, because it is no longer understood either by human rights activists or sometimes even by our own EU Agency for Fundamental Rights. I am therefore calling for democratic control of this institution. If this does not happen, it may even become a financially costly burden, detracting from the reputation not only of the European Commission, but, indirectly, of the entire European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the rapporteur has done an excellent job. However, to quote a popular Hungarian saying, unless it is implemented, it will be worth as much as horseshoes on a dead horse. I do not see a political will in the European Commission to enforce these rights and to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States. I have much faith in Mrs Reding. She has more courage than all the male Commissioners combined, as she dared to oppose Mr Sarkozy, even though Mr Barroso had tried to dissuade her from doing so for a long time. In the upcoming period, she will be faced with a considerable challenge, as the Hungarian Government assuming the EU Presidency is committing serious infringements of fundamental rights. It is restricting the freedom of the media, abolishing the rights of trade unions in relation to public servants, and it fails to protect private property when it appropriates the private pension savings of three million citizens. This government is violating fundamental rights, and you, Mrs Reding, must have the courage to initiate an infringement procedure.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, notwithstanding the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and the national constitutions, serious violations of human rights persist on a daily basis in the European Union and in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my country – Italy – there is a regime in force in which freedom of the press is violated, political parties take part in elections by submitting fake signatures, State secrecy covers up violent attacks (including by the Mafia), our Prime Minister – though not for much longer, we hope – profits from international cooperation with regimes like those in Russia and Libya, as was also confirmed by WikiLeaks. The European Union cannot allow itself to turn a blind eye to all of this.</p>
      <p sl="it">For these reasons, I support the report, which contains many of the amendments submitted by me and approved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Amongst these, I should like to single out paragraphs 20 and 40, which call for human rights violations to be monitored and penalised, and for national legislative proposals with the potential to violate human rights to be frozen before they become law, until the EU approves them.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also supported the incentive to use Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union to address human rights violations and to bolster the mandate of the Agency for Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report makes numerous positive references to minorities, rights, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, immigrants and asylum seekers, freedom of the press and social rights. For these reasons, I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we are all aware that many kinds of discrimination still exist in the countries of the European Union, affecting different sections of the population and cultural minorities. However, we cannot forget that there is general discrimination against women: discrimination against women continues to make itself felt to a greater or lesser degree in many different areas in the EU Member States. Women workers still have difficulty in getting jobs and in being promoted in their careers, and they still fall victim to low wages and other forms of discrimination that always affect them. The gender pay gap in the EU stands at about 18%. Urgent measures are therefore needed to combat these discriminatory situations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, accession on the part of the EU to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms also conceals the risk that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) will be able to pass judgment on any EU legal act; the judges of the European Court of Justice have already warned against taking this step.</p>
      <p sl="de">I very much doubt that the ECHR will always pass neutral and appropriate judgments. Its President has himself admitted that he would examine cases brought by asylum seekers more closely than other cases. Preferential treatment for certain complainants is not fitting conduct for a neutral judge. The ECHR is currently attempting to suspend the Dublin Convention and prevent deportations from Austria to Greece. Why is this? Is Greece unsafe? Do we really want to be subject to a court that wants to ban the cross in classrooms? The cross is the symbol of Christianity, one of the foundations of Europe and of our fundamental values.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the European Court of Human Rights clearly has no respect for such human rights, I cannot see that it is possible to recognise it here as an approved and appropriate decision-making body.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the European Union has always been ready to criticise countries outside its borders in order to promote fundamental rights. In the case of its own Member States, however, it has often been powerless following their accession. This should not be the case any longer, as today it is not only economic principles that bind us together. The report of Mrs Kinga Gál summarises the most urgent and most important steps in the development of internal fundamental rights protection. We need an effective rights protection system, and thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, we will now be able to establish one. Violations of the fundamental rights of citizens cannot remain without consequence. We must be able to hold those committing infringements to account at both Member State and European Union level.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I can only agree with Mrs Reding in that the Commission should exercise the right to initiate infringement proceedings in all justified cases. The addition to the set of available procedures of a procedure with a blocking effect can serve as an effective tool in the protection of rights against Member State measures violating fundamental rights. Yes, we need to protect persons with disabilities, we need to eliminate discrimination and, last but not least, we need to protect European linguistic diversity.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, the issue of human rights must be addressed at European level and the Member States themselves must also take responsibility for guaranteeing the fundamental rights of their citizens. At European level, for instance, it is very important to establish a European Union strategy on the rights of the child, because not all Member States are capable of guaranteeing the protection of children’s rights at national level. It is therefore necessary to develop practical measures to combat child abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Disabled people, who still suffer from discrimination in their social, professional and cultural lives, are another priority. We must therefore establish a concrete system of EU legislation on the rights of disabled people and develop an EU strategy on the disabled.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to stress that combating trafficking of human beings, especially women and children, is still a huge problem and one of the worst violations of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is also very important to combat poverty and social exclusion, particularly as regards elderly people, who have suffered most during the recession.</p>

    <intervention id="2-034" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank all the committee members who worked alongside the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, on these areas, as well as all those MEPs who took the floor today in this House, thereby showing that fundamental rights are very important. I can only support what has already been said by several MEPs, namely that it is high time that we focused on fundamental rights within the European Union in order to be credible and be able to talk about fundamental rights outside the European Union. This issue has been somewhat neglected. It will no longer be in future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that the Commission’s annual report on the application of the Charter, which will elaborate on all the observations made by everyone regarding specific types of discrimination, will truly enable us every year to discuss what is not working and try to correct it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Correct it how? There is this idea of a ‘freezing mechanism’, as the rapporteur called it, this prevention system where one would intervene with regard to a measure being taken in a Member State up to the point at which it is implemented. I have asked my experts to analyse this, and the institutional issues that such a mechanism raises are very complex. For the time being, although we will have to continue the analysis and see what is really happening, it seems to me that there is no legal basis to act in such a way and that a change in the Treaty would be needed to activate such a prevention mechanism. It is an attractive idea. We will carry on looking for a mechanism that could be used without changing the Treaty so as to deal with the most pressing issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Charter is not applicable in absolute terms, because this is a common misconception. It is applicable only when Member States implement European rules, for instance, when a European directive that has been decided between the Council and Parliament is then integrated into European law. In that situation, the Charter does apply, but not in absolute terms. In absolute terms, that is to say, for all other cases, jurisdiction lies with the national courts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When the European Union becomes a member of the Council of Europe Convention, there will be an extra dimension that we will then have to implement, and it concerns the way in which we manage our rights policy. This is what seems to me to be of utmost importance, beyond all the specific questions that have been asked – and I will respond individually to the MEPs who asked them – I think that the main issue is the fundamental one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Outside the EU, in our Member States, within governments, the importance of the Charter has not yet been fully realised. Therefore, we have some work to do to raise awareness so that this culture of rights, this policy of values exists throughout Europe, so that, when a law is passed, when a law is applied, people everywhere ask themselves if it complies with the values we have subscribed to; that is to say that, as political leaders, we must ask ourselves almost systematically, when we act, whether what we are doing is compatible with the fundamental rights we have subscribed to.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This seems to me to be the most important element. As a matter of fact, I can tell you that the Commission is due to take a decision today on whether to scrap the exequatur, in other words, that a proposal will be submitted to make court rulings valid anywhere in Europe. This is a decision of major importance, and for the first time, when proposing this new legislation, we focused on respect for fundamental rights. We did not just carry out an economic analysis, or study the impact on the market; we also studied the impact on values.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you can tell, we are gradually moving towards this new policy, and I think that, between us – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – we should ensure that this annual report on the application of the Charter, which I will submit on behalf of the Commission and which Parliament will criticise or approve, is a great moment of truth and an opportunity to take a close look at matters. This is also about truly showing to the outside world, to our voters, that the Charter is a living entity. The Charter is not merely a text; it is there to be put into practice. And if it is not put into practice, the elected representatives of the people will say so loud and clear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is what we must try to establish during the two or three years before the next elections. I think we can achieve this goal gradually, with the first exercise of this kind in spring, then the establishment of a tradition in this House, so that no one can ever say again, when you examine human rights outside the Union on Wednesdays or Thursdays, ‘You have not put your own house in order’. Let us do it together!</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the encouraging words and the words of support. I would especially like to thank Mrs Reding for the openness and cooperation in which we have been working together for quite some time now, and for the clear and specific answers and messages. I believe that the considerations of the shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members are, after all, all included in this report, and that acceptable compromises have been reached. Therefore, I cannot accept the letters of amendment that have now been re-submitted to the plenary, as I think that this report is acceptable as it is. I would like to point out that we should by no means throw the baby out with the bath water in the general fundamental rights protection system, and therefore, we should always be mindful of the concrete facts and attempt to translate the expectations we are debating here today into something tangible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am therefore pleased that in tomorrow’s plenary sitting, we will see these concrete facts in the topic of combating human trafficking, where special protection will be provided to child victims in the field of victim protection. This will also be under debate now with the adoption of the Citizens’ Initiative, as a result of which we will truly be able to speak of a citizens’ Europe, as these European citizens will be able to influence the legislative procedure. However, I also consider it symbolic that we will debate on and adopt the report on the situation of human rights in the world tomorrow. The fact that the Hungarian Presidency is also setting its priorities in a similar spirit, and is placing emphasis on the strengthening of an EU that is close to its citizens, is welcome. However, I would like to remind my fellow Members that we should avoid employing double standards, especially here in this House. I say this to my fellow Members who assisted, perhaps for years – and here I address my Hungarian socialist fellow Members – in the gravest human rights infringements, and are now criticising others with unfounded accusations only to regain the voter confidence they may have lost due to these very infringements of human rights. I thank everyone for their cooperation and assistance.</p>

How can we reproach or teach someone outside the EU if, in our own Community, the law is regularly violated? So far, Latvia, a Member of the EU, has not implemented a resolution of the European Parliament of 11 March 2004, where Parliament ‘proposes that the Latvian authorities envisage the possibility of allowing non-citizens who are long-time inhabitants to take part in local self-government elections’. Three hundred and thirty-five thousand permanent inhabitants (15%) of Latvia lack their basic rights, but it does not worry anyone. The European Parliament can discuss cases of breaches of human rights everywhere except in its own territory. I have voted in favour of Kinga Gál’s initiative.

      <p sl="en">I would like to use this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for shedding light on such an important issue. The Lisbon Treaty has redefined competences and responsibilities in many fields and, among them, made the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. The European Parliament has been acting as watchdog of fundamental rights and the Lisbon Treaty has consolidated the fact. I very much support the notion of enhancing the role of the European Parliament with regard to a systematic approach to legislative proposals and amendments. While we are critical of human rights violations around the world, we must apply the same scrutiny to what is going on within the borders of the European Union. There is no reason to be overly pleased, as we receive signals of racism, xenophobia, sexism and other forms of discrimination in the Member States far too often. The work ahead of us remains vast, but I am more than sure that consistent work on upholding fundamental rights in the EU will help us prevail.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Union, as a community of states that offer a high level of protection of human rights, always boldly raises its voice against serious infringements taking place in other parts of the world. The European Parliament usually condemns practices that show complete disregard for the universal fundamental principles of human rights, wherever they may occur, in commendable unison. It is less often, however, that we respond with similar determination to infringements within the borders of the EU, even though this would be the most effective way to send out a message to those countries around the world that do not respect human rights. A common EU action would achieve the greatest result if we voiced our dissatisfaction with the same determination and peremptoriness within our own area in respect of the assertion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In very few cases do we call ourselves to account in connection with these ideals, which are an integral part of the European spirit, and which have been legally binding for a year now thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. And in the event that we actually do so, we come across as powerless and impotent in the absence of appropriate sanctions. This, in turn, inevitably affects the force and credibility of our criticisms toward third countries and our foreign policy efforts for the promotion of human rights and democracy. I do not believe that Europe can give these up in the future.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, today is an important day for all victims, because today we shall adopt the European Protection Order, which is a significant step forward in terms of their rights. Victims are unfairly forgotten about, and it is paradoxical that aggressors often have many more rights and that there is more said about aggressors’ rights than victims’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, Parliament will honour all victims, reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims, that this European Protection Order will protect all victims equally in the European Union from this day onwards.</p>
      <p sl="es">We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must say that, following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency, and many conversations with the Commission, we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy with. This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that today, Parliament will reflect the decision made by those committees and by those of us who produced this report, which was adopted by a huge majority. This would send a clear message to the Council about what Europeans want, which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice, to be protected, and for a victim who has a restraining order against her aggressor in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to another country.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have an obligation to facilitate access to justice for Europeans, and especially for victims, who are the most vulnerable. The protection of all victims, without exception, has been my beacon throughout the development of this report. I therefore wanted to include victims of terrorism, people trafficking, organised crime and honour crimes, along with a special chapter for minors, who are the most vulnerable victims, and we never think about how to protect them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Although this order will protect all victims, women who suffer from domestic violence will benefit most from this instrument for judicial cooperation, as their aggressors will not be able to travel through Europe with impunity, and will know that they will be pursued in the same way as in the country where they attacked their partners.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament must therefore send a clear message to the Council today about what we want. We will therefore vote with our eyes fixed on the victims, on those who suffer, on those who need us to protect them, on those who are afraid and need to live in freedom and hope.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid and never dare to take that one step further. We need to be brave, the Member States need to be brave, and I hope that the vote today will be a majority in favour and encourage those who still have doubts as to whether this instrument will open a door for victims. I also hope that in the near future, the Commission will put forward wide-ranging legislation in favour of victims’ rights, for which it has my full support and, I am sure, Parliament’s support.</p>
      <p sl="es">I repeat: this small but major step that is the European Protection Order will improve protection for all victims, preventing further crimes and relieving the consequences of those that have already been committed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, we have an obligation to remove the obstacles that have so far prevented real protection across Europe. Through our vote today, we have the opportunity to save lives, which is what we are going to do, and we should be genuinely proud of that.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this proposal for a directive that we are bringing to plenary today to keep away aggressors who pursue their victims until they kill them, wherever they hide, is a clear message that Parliament must send to European society and to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are not going to remain defenceless against the crimes that are still repeatedly committed on a daily basis in European countries, and remain hidden in the shadows of people’s homes. These crimes also remain in the statistical shadows, as if the law of survival of the strongest took sole precedence at the heart of cohabitation, but we are trying to enforce the Charter of Fundamental Rights that we adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="es">Did it not occur to those drafting Chapter I of the Charter that a threat to physical integrity and dignity could come not only from the public institutions and the state, but also disguised as affection? For the 25% of European women currently suffering some form of violence, their torturers have private names, and defending themselves against the attacks does not allow them to be citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">According to non-governmental organisations, more than 2 500 women die every year in the European Union without us having asked ourselves whether those crimes can be prevented or avoided. European women have therefore welcomed the initiative by the Member States and the Spanish Presidency to bring a European Protection Order before Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are creating a European area of security: the European arrest warrant means that none of our countries can be a haven for criminals. Let us create a climate of mutual trust; through the protection order, we are creating an area of justice and freedom, because the victims of these crimes can be received in any country without having to go through further proceedings, as my co-rapporteur, Mrs Jiménez-Becerril, said.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about ‘private terrorism’, which is the name now given to this continuous crime of attacks hidden in the privacy of the home. We are also talking about preventive measures from a different source. Not all countries have or are going to have the same legal traditions: the more progress we make, the more an instrument that can provide for our diversity is and will be necessary The Council’s legal services have taken this view, as have Parliament’s legal services. Where does the resistance lie? Ladies and gentlemen, it does not lie in the complexity of our legal system, which will continue to exist.</p>
      <p sl="es">The law is not a tool for creating conflicts, but for resolving them. This has been the view of the conservative governments that have supported the initiative based on sound judgment. If we were talking about guarantees and fundamental rights when we talked about terrorism, how could we have implemented international agreements if it was not because we were talking about security? Are 2 500 women every year not a security problem for Europe?</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not the first time in history that the law has faced a challenge. We therefore regret the Commission’s position throughout the procedure, because we cannot talk about legal basis when we are talking about political will. Let us not invoke the law just when it suits us.</p>
      <p sl="es">This text is the result of an agreement. The improvements that we have incorporated regarding the right to information, translation and procedural guarantees have taken into account the fact that this is a recognition instrument, and Parliament has decided that it is a priority for the Member States to put the existing data on the table out in the open.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have not forgotten about victims’ rights to psychological assistance and legal aid. We will continue to fight for these things, and let us hope that they will be included in the next package on victims.</p>
      <p sl="es">We would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for the work that it has done, along with all the shadow rapporteurs and our team. Through this vote today, we want to send a message to the Council that this is Parliament’s will; now it is up to the Council to take on its responsibilities. We will not succeed in tackling prevention if some Member States believe that we do not have a problem because we do not have the data.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now it is the Council that is going to decide whether Europe is truly getting involved in combating violence and defending fundamental rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the protection of citizens, in practice mostly women, subjected to or at risk of violence is very high on the agenda of all the institutions working on this subject at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that it be on the agenda because we share the same objective: providing protection for victims in the best possible conditions across the borders of the EU. That is also why I have supported the aim of this protection from the outset, and that is the reason why I am preparing the ambitious package on victims’ rights to be adopted in spring 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am fully aware of the work of the co-rapporteurs, Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Romero López, and of both the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who have added a lot of value to the ongoing work in order to improve the protection of victims. I look at some of the proposals you have made: for instance, that victims do not have to bear the costs, that they receive translation and interpretation services or that delays in the recognition procedures are reduced. I am ready to work on an effective and legally sound mechanism designed to help victims benefit from civil law protection measures across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have been working on the procedural rights for persons who are accused. The corollary of this is that we work on the rights of persons who have been victims, because we very often speak about the accused in court proceedings but forget that there has been a victim, so we have to ‘re-put’ the victim at the centre of attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Commission’s future victims package will build on and develop the excellent work undertaken by the Spanish Presidency, the Belgian Presidency, the Council and, of course, the European Parliament. All this work is very important. It will be put together so that when the victims package is on the table, it will be comprehensive, it will be complete, and it will make a real difference to all victims – be they women, children or men, although most are women and children – to enable us to quickly come up with concrete measures which are applicable and do not create legal uncertainty. Thank you for this work. It is going to be taken into consideration when we prepare the victims package.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, roughly 8 000 Romanian women in Spain have benefited this year, as victims, from protection orders which are valid in Spain. They must also be extended to Romania and other Member States in which they travel.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to unofficial estimates, there are roughly 100 000 women in Europe benefiting from protection orders which are valid in the state that issued them. The draft directive changes the limited, territorial aspect of these protection measures. The instrument being introduced will ensure that a protection order issued in one Member State will be recognised in the Member States in which the victim travels so that the area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality and the victims of violence or other victims can live and travel without fear.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Parliament’s desire is for victims’ protection to be extended. This is why, after this directive, we are asking for and anticipating from the Commission that the next step will be to extend protection to victims in this common area of justice and security. We are therefore awaiting the package with eagerness and interest in spring 2011.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to end by reiterating that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) gives its support to protection for victims, this draft directive and extended protection for victims.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal for a directive – for which I should like to express my great thanks to the rapporteurs, with whom I worked as a shadow – Parliament is supporting and expanding the Council’s proposal, which was designed to protect people across all 27 Member States who suffer forms of persecution or serious and repeated threats from known and previously identified persons – often ex-boyfriends, husbands or partners – who threaten their physical and sexual integrity, dignity and personal freedom.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, the number of attacks and killings – particularly against women – is on the increase. Their complaints are often not taken seriously enough by the police and the judiciary, and protection orders and measures against the aggressor are currently only valid in the country in which they are issued. Commissioner Reding, the measure under approval may not be perfect, but it plugs a legislative vacuum.</p>
      <p sl="it">After all, in creating the European area of freedom, security and justice, we have always acted empirically, at times pushing matters through where necessary. Indeed, we believe that this initiative is important because it will allow all citizens of the European Union – men and women – and all European residents to travel freely across borders, taking their human rights and their rights to protection and security with them, as stated in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament intended as the legal basis, in order to give a more coherent direction to the structure of the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="it">Through the establishment of the European Protection Order, the protected person is guaranteed to be looked after even in other Member States, through a fast and free-of-charge procedure. Each Member State must appoint a competent authority to inform victims of their rights, carry out campaigns, collect statistics and inform the person as soon as their national protection order has been issued. Furthermore, it gives a great boost to the creation of the European legal area and the implementation of freedom of movement, and it also applies the ordinary legislative procedure involving codecision between the Council and Parliament for the first time.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope that the Council will confirm this commitment and I hope that the Commission – though showing particular attention to the coming ‘Security for Victims’ package of measures – does not miss this particular chance to respond right now to this extremely serious situation, which is also demonstrated by European and national statistics. Amongst other things, this could lead to important legal convergence among Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore suggest that we avoid any delays and make a specific commitment to this particular type of victim protection.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I want the European Protection Order to be particularly effective in preventing violence against women and to serve as a helpful prelude to the proposal that the Commission is preparing in order for us to have a similar instrument for all types of crime.</p>
      <p sl="es">I regret the fact that the drafting of this text has been so difficult and complex, despite the fact that we all share its central objective.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also have liked this order to have incorporated two issues. Firstly, the European register of protection orders, with the corresponding privacy guarantees, in order to prevent bureaucracy for the beneficiaries and have the orders applied immediately. Moreover, this would reduce the cost of the processes that have to be carried out by the competent authorities, and would ultimately provide standardised, constantly updated statistics.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I believe that we should have made an effort to explore cooperation in this field with third countries, especially if we pay attention to the statistics regarding the origins of the victims and their possible changes of residence.</p>
      <p sl="es">The incipient European External Action Service has thus lost the opportunity to publicly introduce itself with a mission such as this, which Europeans understand and which solves problems that are real to all Europeans at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think that we in Parliament need to be very responsible and act within the mandate that we have been given, which tells us that, at European level too, we must protect women who are victims of violence and put a stop to murderers.</p>
      <p sl="es">As has been said, this is about combating a type of social terrorism, which is chauvinist violence. We must not, therefore, get caught up in statistics or legal ins and outs. We are talking about justice, basic rights, life and death, defending those that must be defended against their attackers, and, most importantly, not having to regret the fact that 2 500 women every year are victims of the legal lethargy in which we are all immersed.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are all aware of the legal difficulties and that this is an innovative exercise in the post-Lisbon interinstitutional dynamic. However, those difficulties should not, under any circumstances, be an excuse for not moving forward. The protection of the rights of the women who have been or could be victims of violence and murders and the prevention of such acts cannot be subordinated to a few legal issues. We need to adopt the political will required by the urgency and importance of this case.</p>
      <p sl="es">It goes without saying that it is important to do things well but, above all, it is essential that we do them and, in my view, that is the fundamental vision that we can send to both the Council and the Commission through this text that I hope we are going to adopt. It needs to be understood that under no circumstances can we paralyse initiatives because there are technical difficulties that we have not been able to resolve before.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the two rapporteurs and both the Spanish and Belgian presidencies for the work they have done in order to continue making progress, working and overcoming the scourge of what is, I repeat, chauvinist violence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have been following the trialogues closely and would like to thank my colleagues, especially from the EPP and S&amp;D Groups, for the work they have been doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a lawyer in the UK, I have had experience over the years of providing legal advice and support to people who have been victims of domestic abuse, stalking or harassment by a relative or a former partner. I have seen at first hand the distress that physical, psychological and sexual abuse can cause and the state of vulnerability of its victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully support the aims and objectives of this proposal. However, I also have to express concerns regarding the legal base and scope. It seems clear to me that this proposal has a criminal base only, through the use of Article 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. By their nature and by law, some of the offences that this proposal intends to cover are civil law matters, yet there is a noticeable absence of the use of Article 81.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst I do not object to EU legal cooperation, I strongly believe that we need to ensure that the legislation we produce at EU level is legally sound, robust and can be effectively implemented at Member State level without compromising existing Member State legal systems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I support the protection of victims. However, when I first came across the European Protection Order, I thought it sounded scary, like the European Arrest Warrant, which, in my opinion, is one of the most intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women. We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism – and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that. Let us be clear and honest here: the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law. If proof were needed, we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK, for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life. We have a saying in England: ‘once bitten, twice shy’. We have been bitten once by the European Arrest Warrant. I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, taking the proposed amendments into account, there is no mistaking the fact that the directive in question is one of the first initiatives aimed at achieving these important goals. We should ensure not only that the victims of violence are safe from further harm in their own country, but also that they benefit from such protection measures throughout the European Union. For this reason, I believe that we should support the rapporteur’s position.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be noted, too, that the initiative has a deliberately broad scope. Although the majority of protection orders issued relate to women who are victims of gender-based violence, the initiative can cover all victims of violence – children and adults of both sexes, provided the perpetrator has been identified. In this context, the Stockholm Programme states that the victims of crime, including terrorism, who are most vulnerable or who find themselves in particularly exposed situations, such as persons subjected to repeated violence in close relationships, victims of gender-based violence or persons who fall victim to other types of crimes in a Member State of which they are not nationals or residents, are in need of special support and legal protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In connection with the above, the European Protection Order should apply to the victims of all crimes, including human trafficking, the victims of female genital mutilation, forced marriages, honour killings, incest and other crimes of this type. This initiative should therefore be supported, and I lend my full support to the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, one hundred thousand people are currently benefiting from the European Protection Order. One of them is Rasja, who would like to move to Spain with her children. If the order pronounced against her stalker in the Netherlands does not relocate with her to Spain, she and her children, too, will become a sitting target there, unless the Spanish authorities recognise or enforce the same order. Fortunately, however, Spain does recognise it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This protection also applies to those being persecuted for exercising their right to free speech. They have to be able to speak in other European countries with the knowledge that those who have threatened them will not be sitting there in the audience. The European Protection Order makes that possible; it is a splendid initiative and one that has been supported by the Dutch Government. Unfortunately, with the new coalition, the status of people enjoying such protection has undergone a 180 degree reversal: women, men and children who are having to live in fear every day are callously being left high and dry. It is simply unacceptable that an individual’s safety should stop at the border.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For the sake of one hundred thousand people, I am now saying ‘yes’ to the European Protection Order. I expect all governments, including that of my own country, to do their utmost to increase the safety, protection and freedom of their citizens, so that all people can live in freedom and security.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that this directive on the European Protection Order to safeguard victims is another sign of a momentous shift in real guarantees, above all for women, but not exclusively so, as has already been said.</p>
      <p sl="it">The guidelines for this measure had already been developed, firstly by the Treaty of Lisbon, and then by the Stockholm Programme. In particular, I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero López, on their diligent work and on tackling the many problems encountered in the Council to smooth the way for this particularly important proposal, for an area of freedom, justice and security that will really serve citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">The proposal combats domestic violence firmly and determinedly, has quite a significant range of measures and a scope that appears to be wholly consistent. These ready-made, timely and effective precautionary measures lead us to believe that this proposal could also be used effectively to protect victims’ families.

      <p sl="it">I should like to conclude, Madam President, by affirming how important it is to have close cooperation between the Member States as well as great sensitivity for the application of this measure in practice, just as it is crucial not to forget the importance of psychological support for the victims.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the European Protection Order is an important step towards the protection of victims throughout Europe. We are now sending a powerful signal to the Council and the Commission that the European Parliament is keen to have this protection order and that it should enter into force soon. We should now try to overcome the opposition that there is to it in the Council as well as all the legal reasons that the Commission is putting forward for opposing it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important that the directive should be applied over a wide area. It must incorporate not just orders in respect of criminal acts but also various other kinds of protection order. It should not involve any sort of legal hair-splitting. This protection order should also be flexible enough to take account of the differences in national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important that Parliament focuses attention not only on the victims of gender-based violence, but on other victims of violence. The directive needs to spell out what a victim’s rights are and what the procedures are for lodging a complaint, and these are some of the things that I myself have tried to highlight in Parliament’s position. It is also important that the country in which the protection order is being requested informs its citizens of these procedures.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When the protection order enters into force, the work will not have really stopped there. The authorities need to be educated, and we cannot be completely satisfied with an information campaign that is simply restricted to the framework of the present one.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the provisions included in the report under discussion today fill me with great enthusiasm. The guarantee that protection granted to victims in one Member State will also apply in any other European Union Member State to which they are forced to travel for fear of repeated violence represents an opportunity for them to lead a normal life. The European Protection Order will mean that protection measures adopted in one EU Member State can be recognised, applied and enforced by courts in another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is more, extending the application of the directive to the victims of any kind of violence, not just the victims of gender-based violence, represents a further milestone. All victims deserve respect and expect that the perpetrators of their suffering will be punished fairly. It seems to me that only a protection mechanism which follows the victim can be fully effective and prevent a repeat of the same offence, as well as offering real protection to the victim. I am delighted that Poland was one of the countries that put forward this initiative.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, if the European Union is to become a genuine area of freedom, security and justice, we must eliminate the differences still persisting in this area between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Victims of violence must be protected against the perpetrators not only in their own countries, but must have protective measures made available to them throughout the EU. Although this is a broad proposal, it directly concerns women who are victims of domestic violence. It is good that this also provides an opportunity to deal with the situation of other potential victims, whether victims of human trafficking, forced marriages, honour killings or incest, or the situation of witnesses or of victims of terrorism and organised crime. I personally very much applaud the effort to provide the best possible protection to victims also by ensuring the necessary legal certainty, among other things. Victims should be able to rely on clear rules and should always be informed about the measures that are available to them in their country of origin and in the countries they want to move to, or to which they have already moved.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs. However, the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking, in which a person has been a victim of violence by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place. Obviously, this is a matter of fundamental importance for hundreds of thousands of women in the European Union and therefore I fully support its content.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, however, these measures do not take into account the victims of organised crime who, in the majority of cases, do not need to be defended from an identified or identifiable person, but from organisations against which a restraining order certainly cannot be applied. Therefore, I think that the European Parliament should regard this directive as a first step in implementing the Stockholm Programme, which talks expressly about measures to protect the victims of criminal activity, and it seems to me that Mrs Jiménez and Commissioner Reding are of the same mind.</p>
      <p sl="it">I appeal to the European Commission to ensure that the package of measures to protect victims, which is planned for 2011, also protects victims of organised crime and victims injured in the course of duty on a European level.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction. The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States. The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter, but it was not possible to achieve this. A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence, stalking and, above all, exploitation of minors, which I consider to be very, very important. It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular. However, there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also, to some extent, represent a means for Member States to avoid compliance with the directive. Therefore, in a year’s time, we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further, because all victims in all countries need the same protection.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to support the idea contained in the draft European Protection Order.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The protection of persons under threat at the level of individual Member States appears to be insufficient in many cases. Thanks to the openness of the European space today, young people often enter into international marriages and international marriage commitments. Not all of these commitments last long, however, and the children often then become hostages to disputes between their parents. Hostile parents often refuse to respect the decisions of courts from other countries granting custody of the children to one of them and simply take justice into their own hands and carry off the children of former partners to their own countries, exploiting differences between the legal systems of individual Member States to overcome valid court decisions. The victims of this European legal anarchy are often small, innocent children. I hope this problem will be resolved by the European Protection Order.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, even though some measures have been taken in recent years to protect victims, many of the people affected often feel left in the lurch. While lawyers and judges hear a great deal in their training about the rights of defendants, they learn very little about dealing with victims. This is not the only area where greater awareness is necessary. It is also needed in medical training so that the use of violence can be better recognised. For child victims, the matter of the statutory limitation of civil compensation claims in the case of sex offences is essential. Only those who have an unblemished criminal record are allowed to work with children. If, for example, forced marriages are now being prosecuted in Liechtenstein, even without the consent of the victim, and it is possible to take legal action in the case of genital mutilation performed on a minor, this clearly shows the potential danger of the much lauded multicultural enrichment. In my opinion, it is important to take this development in the EU into consideration, as well as its significance in the fight against human trafficking.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, as a lawyer, I have dealt with cases of victims of violence against women and children for over ten years, whether it was domestic violence, rape or trafficking in women; and I had the opportunity to see for myself that the protection order, which is the topic of today’s debate, is one of the important and indispensable means of protecting victims, but it is far from being the only one. Complex measures are required, such as legal advice, psychological support, support to the children concerned, and it is very important to listen to the victims, who are, I am sorry to say, the greatest experts in terms of what they need.</p>

Safeguarding life, physical and psychological integrity, as well as sexual integrity and freedom, are priority objectives where victim protection is concerned. With our political support for the European Protection Order Directive, we have given the issue the visibility it deserves and provided a Europe-wide, comprehensive package of special protection measures that are effective within the Union and grant legal protection and assistance for victims of crime, in particular, violent crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The right to protection from violence is a basic human right regardless of ethnicity, legal status or immigration status, and it is therefore a moral duty for all of us to uphold this right within and beyond national borders.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, we know that there are no legal measures included in the package that is being prepared for victims. This has just been criticised by the European women’s lobby in Parliament: there is talk of good practice and coordination, but we still have a long way to go</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say that the origins of the violence that we are experiencing are not exotic: it is our own violence. I would like to say to the Council and the Member States that violence that comes from other cultures also requires a legal instrument. It is not possible to combat genital mutilation, honour crimes and all the harassment suffered by women from other cultures without an instrument of this nature.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why it is so important that they are also included, and Parliament has worked, through all the amendments from the shadow rapporteurs, to ensure that all these victims are also included in this legal instrument.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why it is so important that we work together on this issue, and why we regret the fact that Parliament and the Commission have not agreed on the same text throughout this procedure. Even if Parliament and the Commission had agreed on the same text, we would still have a battle to fight.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, it does little to help victims of violence to consider that delaying the initiative by two, three or four years would be better for them, because that is not the case.</p>
      <p sl="es">You said during your previous appearance that we had not realised the significance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We did realise its significance. The problem is that it has to be applied; the problem is that we need to take measures, and sometimes when measures need to be taken, they are legal measures, and sometimes there are obstacles in their path. The greatest obstacle is political will.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why it is so important that we all agree on an initiative of this nature, and it is now up to the Council. It is now up to the Member States to decide whether this instrument is really one that is going to be effective for victims and necessary. We believe that it is, which is why we have defended this instrument and why we are here. We also defend its urgency.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why we wanted Parliament to vote in favour by a huge majority, so that the countries that have not yet decided or have decided that they are against this initiative will see it as the only procedure that can be used now and in the future. It is an instrument that is difficult and complex in nature, but which opens the way and will protect victims and the citizenship of women.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I did not intend to speak again, but what has been said needs to be corrected. The measures which will be part of the victims package include an overarching communication, the Lisbonisation of the 2001 framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, a proposal on civil protection measures and, if necessary, a proposal on criminal protection measures. This will be put on the table of this House in May next year.</p>

      <p sl="en">Having said that, I would also like to inform this Parliament that, to date, four opinions have been sent by national parliaments on the protection order: positive ones from the Italian, Greek and Portuguese parliaments and a negative opinion from the German Bundesrat arguing that the directive goes beyond the scope of Article 82, as it covers non-criminal measures and the prevention of crime. It has been rejected on the basis of subsidiarity. We are in the middle of a very complicated issue. By carrying out a serious analysis before putting the legal and non-legal proposals on the table, I will try to propose measures which are sound enough not to victimise victims a second time when it comes to protection measures.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In Romania, domestic violence incidents are estimated to affect 1 200 000 people every year, yet only 1% of the victims of violence are brave enough to report it to the authorities. Frequent domestic tension, brawls and beatings turn family members into traumatised victims who are forced to accept this situation as being the norm. Violence affects a child’s normal, harmonious development. Studies show that the pattern of violent behaviour is passed down from one generation to another in 75% of cases. Stockholm syndrome must be treated, but not through feeble reforms, as is happening in Romania. Proactive measures are required to combat this phenomenon, along with amending the relevant legislative framework and establishing dialogue and cooperation between all the state institutions with powers in this area and civil society. In this respect, the European Protection Order must be a strong instrument capable of providing a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States’ borders. This will also include protection against acts of violence committed by groups of people and will apply to all victims of crime, such as victims of human trafficking, female genital mutilation, forced marriages, honour crimes, incest, gender-based violence, as well as witnesses and victims of terrorism and organised crime.</p>

      <p sl="en">co-rapporteur. – Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my co-rapporteur, Ms Hedh, the Council and the Commission and all those who were involved in this demanding work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current trafficking situation is worrying. The estimated volume is several hundreds of thousands of victims inside Europe, the second biggest crime-related business, with an estimated profit of USD 32 million. There are new trends in trafficking in human beings. We have more victims in forced labour. We have more victims coming from Member States and, in addition, we have more children among the victims. The estimated global share of child victims is between 40% and 50%. A recent report from the OSCE called on countries to change their perception of considering human trafficking as a marginal phenomenon and instead encourage them to recognise it as modern-day slavery on a massive scale.</p>
      <p sl="en">Combating trafficking in human beings needs a holistic approach, although we only have a limited set of tools. Our task is to amend the legislation. The Lisbon Treaty gave us a new legal basis – Article 83. This gives us the means to establish a common approach with a view to creating a more dissuasive environment for traffickers and, at the same time, stronger protection for victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal, which is a consolidated text agreed upon with the Council and the Commission, broadens the definition of trafficking, bearing in mind that the forms and trends are changing. The draft gives opportunities for higher penalties, defining a minimum for maximum penalties, encouraging seizing and confiscating the proceeds and assets resulting from trafficking. The proposal opens the issue of the victimisation of victims, entitling courts not to impose penalties on criminal activities of victims which are committed under duress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Assistance and support should be provided for victims before, during and for an appropriate time after criminal proceedings, while assistance and support for victims is not made conditional on the victims’ willingness to cooperate in criminal investigations, prosecutions and trials. The proposal contains a special provision to enhance the protection of children during the investigation and assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft directive also has a provision on the European Anti-Trafficking Coordinator who, in the future, could contribute to a more comprehensive, more coherent and more coordinated anti-trafficking policy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">co-rapporteur . – In 2010, people are being bought and sold as slaves in Europe. This is happening despite the fact that slavery was prohibited more than 250 years ago. They are being forced into prostitution, forced labour or begging. They suddenly find themselves with an owner, who they absurdly enough often believe they are indebted to. Human trafficking is one of the most serious crimes in the world and, unfortunately, it is growing in extent all the time. It is a serious violation of the human rights which we in the EU defend fiercely and fight every day to uphold.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would therefore like to begin by thanking Mrs Malmström for producing a legislative proposal on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings so quickly. I would also like to thank my fellow Member from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, Mrs Bauer, for her excellent cooperation, and all of the shadow rapporteurs who have worked on the directive. Finally, a big thank you to all of the other members of staff, who have done a fantastic job.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Human trafficking is currently the fastest growing cross-border crime. According to the UN report ‘Trafficking in persons’ for 2009, human trafficking is the activity that provides the second-largest income for criminal networks after arms trafficking. It is absolutely clear that no country can solve the problem of human trafficking on its own. Trafficking in human beings is going on in all countries in Europe and the human traffickers move their victims across national borders every day.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We therefore need to work together, and our legislation in this area needs to be as harmonised as possible. Therefore, the proposal for an EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, who will review and coordinate the EU’s work together with the national coordinators, is also a good one.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In order to tackle the problem of human trafficking, we need to have penalties that reflect the seriousness of the crime and that really hurt those who are making money out of trafficking in human beings. I think that we have made some progress with the proposals for penalties contained in the legislative proposal. It has also been proposed that the Member States should, in a legally certain manner, seize the human traffickers’ assets gained from their crime.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, it is not enough to punish the perpetrators. Protection for victims of human trafficking must also improve. Without protection for victims, we will never be able to prosecute the human traffickers. Victims must receive the help they need and it is important, above all, to create a safe environment that will enable them to choose to cooperate with the police.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A passage is also proposed concerning enhanced protection for children who are victims of human trafficking, and that is something that I am very pleased about. Since 79% of victims of human trafficking are women and because sexual exploitation is by far the most usual type of human trafficking, it is crucial to view the legislation from a gender perspective and for all measures that are proposed to be analysed from the point of view of gender.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Ultimately, if we are ever to get to grips with this problem, we must do something about the uneven distribution of power between men and women. Inequality between men and women is a contributory cause of the vulnerability that leads to human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In order to really tackle the problem of human trafficking, all Member States must put a great deal of effort into preventive work. In principle, this is a matter of reducing the demand in our countries for services provided by victims of human trafficking. If we can reduce demand, then access to services will also reduce. This means that we must deal with those who make human trafficking profitable. We therefore proposed that it should be mandatory for all Member States to criminalise those who knowingly use the services of victims of human trafficking. Under current EU legislation, it is a punishable offence for employers to exploit victims of human trafficking. The same principle ought to apply to individuals who exploit victims.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Unfortunately, we did not succeed in getting this proposal accepted. Thus, the Member States will not be forced to criminalise these people, but they will have to report on the measures they have taken to tackle demand for services provided by victims of human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, we have put this issue on the agenda, and at EU level we received support for our proposal from the relevant committees in Parliament as well as from experts, the police and voluntary organisations. I think that, with the agreement that we are to vote on today, we have come a good way along the road. Let us now stand together to put a stop to the trafficking in human beings in Europe, which is a modern form of slavery.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must not give up, because people’s right to decide when it comes to their own life and their own bodies is a human right that cannot be bought and sold for money like shoelaces or bananas.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me start by recalling that this is indeed an historic text we will adopt today – hopefully – in the vote in a few minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the first EU criminal law instrument after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. I think we can be satisfied with the agreement that we have today.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a balanced compromise between the institutions. I am aware, of course, that Parliament, as represented by the rapporteurs, and the Commission would have preferred some different phrasing in some paragraphs. Globally, however, this is a good result which is fully in line with the objectives of Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission, namely, to fight human trafficking, this horrible modern slavery, this horrible crime which is not worthy of Europe in 2010 and which is a grave violation of the fundamental rights of so many citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have met some of these victims: children, men and many women in the sexual slavery business. Their stories are, of course, horrible. Today, when this directive is adopted, we will have a better tool to help them. This is, indeed, a good Christmas present.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would really like to thank Parliament, in particular, the two rapporteurs, Ms Bauer and Ms Hedh, the shadow rapporteurs and all the others who made it possible to reach an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are several examples of the European Parliament helping to improve the directive. I would note the specific provision concerning the status and rights of unaccompanied minors who are victims of trafficking in Article 14. That was introduced at your request, and we agree that this made the directive better. There are other examples as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to mention one point where I regret that the Commission proposal was not supported by the Council, although we had your support. However, it was not possible to reach an agreement in the Council regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction for offences committed abroad by habitual residents of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">I still believe that a provision guaranteeing that all persons living with us in Europe who commit trafficking offences in other countries could be prosecuted in the EU would have added considerable value. However, it was not possible. The issue will be back again when we deal with the directive on child exploitation and child pornography. Extraterritorial jurisdiction for habitual residents will be even more important when we discuss the possibilities of bringing paedophile sex tourists who live in Europe to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that we should together continue, in talks with the Council, to insist that such a provision should be included in the directive. As I said, we have all done very good work together. Today, we have a very important tool to fight trafficking, protect victims, and make sure that we send the message that this is a very severe crime. It should be punished accordingly and it is now defined in the same way in all Member States. Again, thank you for your contribution.</p>

We need to establish specific measures to protect minors; to criminalise traffickers and middlemen; to establish measures to discourage demand and confiscate the proceeds of the crime; to establish the criminal responsibility of any legal persons that take part in any phase of trafficking; to step up employment inspection and penalties for the exploitation of employees and illegal hiring of irregular immigrants; to strengthen the role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders and of the immigration liaison officers in detecting the channels used by traffickers and their modus operandi ; and finally, strengthening the role of the joint investigation teams of the European Police Office (Europol) in combating the mafias.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to conclude by adding that the figure of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator could make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives that I have mentioned, although his powers and capacities must be clearly defined in order to prevent actions from being duplicated or interference with the functions entrusted to Europol.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to begin by applauding Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh for their comprehensive treatment of this extremely important issue.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Human trafficking is a reprehensible phenomenon in today’s civilised society. It is the third most lucrative illicit trade in the world, after arms and drugs trafficking. This so-called modern form of slavery is a serious crime which violates fundamental human rights. The Treaty of Lisbon has enhanced the activity of the European Union in various areas of criminal law, including the fight against human trafficking. The European Parliament plays an important role here as joint lawmaker. Experience shows, however, that the current legal framework is not sufficiently effective and we must do even more to protect human rights. We must adopt preventive measures targeting human trafficking itself. The greatest attention must be paid to children and women, as the most vulnerable groups. We must do all we can to contribute to dignified living conditions for potential victims of this crime, who tend to be people living on the margins of society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, despite increasing efforts to combat trafficking in human beings, this complicated problem continues to flourish and expand across Europe. This is the reason for intensified actions and adequate measures to protect individuals from the practice of trafficking for different purposes, to prosecute traffickers and to provide effective remedies for victims at national and EU level.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current legal framework will effectively deal with complex transnational problems and will coordinate joint efforts at both national and EU level when addressing this profound human rights abuse and a particular form of violence against women. By means of this legal instrument, we make a joint commitment to ensure that women’s rights across Europe are elevated to a priority level, taking into consideration that this wider phenomenon indisputably has a disproportionate impact on women and girls.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to point out another important issue which I propose should be included in this piece of legislation. It relates to the socio-economic aspects of this widespread problem with European countries or regions where social and economic inequalities are the most important single cause of trafficking. Thanks to our joint efforts, we have achieved a positive outcome in the provision on the issue related to practices such as illegal adoption.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I would strongly highlight that the primary responsibility for combating trafficking rests with the Member States. They should take concrete actions to prevent and suppress trafficking and to protect the human rights of trafficked persons, and should play a greater role in addressing this significant problem.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, let me start by thanking Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their hard work as co-rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This directive concerns prosecution, prevention and protection in the area of human trafficking. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would have liked to have seen somewhat more thorough work, in particular, as regards protecting the victims of human trafficking. I refer here particularly to the right of residence in a country after the victim has been trafficked and, perhaps, rescued. How do we ensure that victims really can build a new life?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, that question has not been sufficiently regulated by this directive. Here, we are merely talking about a form of temporary residence permit, after which you do not know whether or not you will be sent back to the place from which you have been trafficked. We are therefore pinning our hopes on the directive being recast, so that we can sort out some solution or another. We are hoping that that will enable us to start giving real help to the victims.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another aspect that leads to heated debate in this House is the question of whether or not those who use the services of a trafficked individual should be penalised. However, the majority of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance remain of the opinion that penalising such people only serves to push the trafficked individual into deeper misery, because his or her activity then becomes totally illegal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am also pleased to see that, in this directive, Member States will retain freedom of choice on that score, but I would like to ask any Member State dealing with such issues the following: how should we then empower the victim?</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I consider the improved legal measures for the fight against human trafficking, together with the European Protection Order, to be extremely important, as they represent a further step towards protecting women and children in particular from violence. A large part of the text is devoted to the protection of child victims and to helping these victims, who are the most vulnerable section of the population. I am delighted that there has been a compromise with the Council, and that this text is sufficiently emphatic while making it possible to retain the key provisions of substantive criminal law. In my opinion, a European level legal measure criminalising clients who use the services of trafficked persons could be highly problematic. I would therefore like to express my thanks for this directive, which deserves our full support.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs. They have done a huge amount of work and, as a result, definite progress has been made. It could be said that the draft directive is extremely important for the hundreds of thousands of victims of human trafficking and it should put an end to their lawless status. It goes as far as to say that not only protection, but also prevention and, above all, compensation, should play a part.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has a broad area of application relating to human trafficking. We believe this to be right, even though we, of course, have difficulty with the problem of begging – which I openly admit – and also in many respects with illegal migration.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is right that references to gender are to be found throughout this directive and – what to me is the most important point – that the welfare of children is taken into account in the case of unaccompanied minors. I would also like to say from a German point of view that in this respect, we have a lot of ground to make up and I am very pleased that this aspect concerning the children plays a very important part in this draft directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another point worthy of recognition is the fact that, when dealing with this problem, special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability. Preventive measures, such as the training of public officials and the introduction of coordinators in the Member States, constitute major steps in the right direction. If we vote in favour of this today, we deserve to be congratulated.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States, because in any case, they now have to present reports. Perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, according to estimates from international organisations and police forces, trafficking in human beings is now globally the second largest source of profit for organised crime, after drug trafficking. It is thought that around 30 million people are victims of organ trafficking, prostitution and forced labour.</p>
      <p sl="it">This means that the fight against this enormous criminal phenomenon is, above all, a battle for the safety of our citizens against illegal immigration and against crime that generates crime. Faced with a problem of these proportions, Europe must rightly take drastic measures against those who exploit human beings in various ways.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fight against this phenomenon requires cooperation between Member States and between police forces but, above all, certainty regarding the punishment for traffickers. It must also be remembered that many people are exploited because they do not have decent living conditions in their countries of origin: they live in poverty and in desperation and are ready to do anything – even leave their own country for the promise of a better life, which, alas, is never to be found.</p>
      <p sl="it">As well as preventing crime and protecting the victims of trafficking, Europe must also make a greater and more deliberate effort to ensure that these people can find acceptable living conditions in their own countries. The basic principle of European political action must be to ‘help them in their own homes’, so that our efforts are directed not only at suppression, but also at prevention.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, human trafficking is, quite rightly, a pejorative term because it describes a disgusting practice. Human beings, disproportionately women, are treated as though they were commodities, even livestock, to be transported, used and often abused.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the term is used too narrowly. Very little legal economic migration is truly voluntary. Most people, other things remaining equal, would prefer to remain with their own people in their own countries. They migrate for economic enrichment or because economic forces have removed their means of maintaining their livelihoods.</p>
      <p sl="en">Migration is the by-product of global capitalism that sees people not as human beings, but as factors of production that are expendable. Economic migration is as much a form of human trafficking as illicit migration organised by criminal networks. The human traffickers are the governments that quite deliberately unleash supposedly blind economic forces in the service of global capitalism. Economies should exist to serve the people. People do not exist to serve economic forces.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the gender dimension of this proposal for a directive facilitates the instrument to defend the most vulnerable people. The fact that there are numerous references to the trafficking of human beings in the Treaty of Lisbon confirms the immediacy and the seriousness of the problem. Article 5(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union bans the practice, recognising it as a form of slavery and forced labour.</p>
      <p sl="it">The rapporteurs have extended the scope of the protection, with a particular focus on children and women, and on the vulnerable situations that make this form of slavery easier to carry out. The report is also correct in remarking that trafficking in human beings also hides illegal forms of adoption and forced marriages.</p>
      <p sl="it">I feel I must point out the difficulties that border EU Member States have in fighting illegal immigration. Above all, Italy, my own country, has to deal on a daily basis with instances of trafficking that spill out onto our roads and our spaces. We need to communicate and therefore raise awareness so as to involve civil society. The report, as tabled, provides for the careful protection of victims, with the aim of eradicating the phenomenon. I should therefore like to show my support for this proposal, as tabled, and also congratulate the two rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and say that I think this directive is extraordinarily important because it is the first time that the European Union has taken legally binding action in the fight against the trafficking of human beings.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fifty years after the United Nations convention, there are still hundreds of thousands of people in our civilised Europe – mainly women and children – who are reduced to slavery. For the first time, the EU is equipped with a single instrument to fight against the trafficking of human beings, whether for reasons of sexual or labour exploitation, including forced begging.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our group had three priorities: to hit traffickers with uniform, more severe sanctions, including confiscating assets and using them to support the victims of trafficking; to ensure a high level of protection and social rehabilitation for victims, with free legal representation and immunity from prosecution for crimes committed in connection with being trafficked; and to promote the crucial role of the non-governmental organisations, both secular and religious, that work to support the victims.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I am hoping for a revision of the 2004 directive on the resident permit for victims. I would also underline that in the proposal, we provide for the safeguarding of children through strengthened measures and I support Commissioner Malmström’s call for further measures against sex tourism and child pornography.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. Thank you for your cooperation. I think we have put together a good document today. We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking. However, the challenge will be getting the Member States to put this directive into practice. It is crucial that the enforcement bodies, such as the police and the courts, are made aware of how to actually recognise and to prosecute this crime. This is vital, and it is also very important to raise public awareness – as Mrs Matera has already mentioned – so that people are aware of the fact that human trafficking is happening within the EU. It is not just happening somewhere else; theoretically, it could also be happening right outside my front door.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important point that, as Liberals from Germany in particular, we had difficulty with – although this has now been resolved in a positive manner by empowering the Member States – is the criminalisation of people who make use of this sort of service, because if someone is liable to prosecution, he can refuse to make a statement in a subsequent trial. If someone makes use of this right to refuse to give evidence – for example, a man who had been with a prostitute who had been endangered through human trafficking – information will be lost that could be used further to finally uncover this network of human traffickers. It is therefore a good thing that this rests with the Member States, and I would like to thank you very much for your cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the basis of many of the current developments was laid down as far back as hundreds of years ago. I am thinking here of the Industrial Revolution, the advent of representative democracy and the abolition of slavery.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The current fight against human trafficking is a continuation of the struggle that William Wilberforce once began. Unfortunately, human trafficking is one of the worst covert problems in the European Union. It undermines the fundamental rights of our people and the foundations of our democracy. For that reason, I fully support the present report.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, as I understand it, the proposed sentencing tariff for reoffenders will, unfortunately, remain low. The current proposal does not require that any particularly heavy penalties be imposed on human traffickers who have been arrested a number of times. That seems to me to be an unfortunate state of affairs. I am in favour of an approach where a trafficker who is arrested for a second or a third offence must receive a mandatory life sentence.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, it is important for everyone to join in the fight against trafficking in human beings, with a view to eradicating it. This kind of modern-day slavery is known to be highly lucrative for criminal organisations, which conduct it in a multitude of ways, from sexual exploitation and forced labour to the illegal trade in human organs, or even domestic work and other kinds of undeclared work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These practices – which particularly involve women and, increasingly, children – therefore need to be fought effectively, by criminalising the perpetrators of such crimes and providing support for the victims to escape from their dependency on the criminal organisations. That is also why it is vital to combat the causes of this situation, by creating the conditions for lifting people out of poverty, promoting policies for the fair redistribution of wealth, ensuring access to essential public services, and promoting the creation of jobs with rights and pay levels that afford a decent living. That is also a way forward which it is essential to promote here in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, it has been proven that the most effective way of combating trafficking in human beings is to set an example by imposing strict penalties on traffickers. I strongly recommend, as we tend here in Parliament to set targets and to say ‘20%’ or ‘30%’, that we recommend a standard European legislation which sets a minimum prison sentence for human traffickers of 10-15 years, which cannot be reduced or replaced by a fine. You will see how effective that will be. Standard EU legislation and a minimum term of imprisonment of 10-15 years. I think it will be the most effective measure we have ever taken.

What is at stake is the defence of human rights and the protection of the most vulnerable individuals, women and children in particular. Experience has shown that the legal framework in force is not effective enough and that the European Union has to work harder.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we are taking a huge step towards combating human trafficking in an efficient manner. The rapporteurs have achieved a good result in relation to minimum thresholds for sentences, jurisdiction, non-prosecution and statutory limitation – not all of this is perhaps quite what we would have liked to have seen, but it is nevertheless a very practicable solution. Anything else would also, to some extent, have disrupted national criminal law in the legal systems of the Member States. We need to be more restrained in this regard. I am also convinced that we would have done ourselves a disservice by making customers of prostitutes liable to prosecution, because this is not something we would have prosecuted otherwise.</p>

The new legislation is significantly stronger than the current legislation and it is a major victory in the fight to ensure better help and protection for victims.

When someone has been forced to carry out criminal acts, it is the people behind this who must be punished, not the victims. The European Parliament also believes it is important that the help being offered to victims is always provided in a language and in a format that they can understand. Moreover, we must not forget that voluntary and non-profit-making organisations play a crucial role when it comes to both preventing and combating human trafficking.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the punishment of legal persons for crimes connected with human trafficking helps to intensify the fight against this modern form of slavery.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Of course, the punishment of a legal entity must not exclude the punishment of specific natural persons who have taken part in this activity in any way. Apart from the imposition of financial penalties, effective measures against legal entities include, in my opinion, exclusion from the right to public grants or assistance, suspension of commercial activities and, above all, court decisions on the closing down of said entity. Member States must ensure the adoption of legal measures so that national bodies can decide not to pursue or impose punishments on the victims of human trafficking, and so that they can continue with investigations even when victims withdraw their statements. Last but not least, I would like to point out that the victims of these appalling crimes often continue to be victimised, and find themselves in very precarious circumstances, which is the reason for special protection and support. Special attention must also be paid to underage victims, for whom it is necessary to find even more comprehensive and lasting solutions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, all of the reports discussed this morning have one thing in common – the protection of fundamental human rights in the European Union and a common European process in this area. It is almost beyond belief that in the EU in the 21st century, several hundred thousand people a year fall victim to human trafficking, most of them women and children. It is a sad fact that in the current era, this problem is highly topical, and the statistics unfortunately do not indicate that it is in decline. Quite the reverse. The perpetrators of this serious crime earn astronomical profits from human trafficking, estimated at up to USD 32 billion annually. The protection of human rights and human dignity must be a clear priority in our work, and a common approach by the Member States is essential. I therefore fully support the proposal for a directive, which will introduce further instruments for combating this type of crime, and more effective protection for the victims, compared to existing legal measures, and which will attempt to achieve a more coordinated approach at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, in the final version of the report, involvement in criminal organisations for offences relating to the trafficking of human beings is an aggravating factor that doubles the minimum penalties from five to ten years in prison. In addition, Article 6a makes explicit reference to the seizure and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from this kind of offence.</p>
      <p sl="it">This approach – which I believe is absolutely right and I hope may also be carried over to other legislation – looks the facts in the face and recognises that the trafficking of people for various forms of exploitation, such as, for example, prostitution, criminal activities and organ trafficking, is carried out by international criminal organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am also pleased with the provisions of Article 7, which directs Member States not to prosecute people for their involvement in criminal activities that they have been compelled to commit as victims of trafficking. Often, in fact, those who suffer the violence of trafficking not only suffer injuries, but also the insult of being incriminated for doing what they were compelled to do, prostitution being a typical example. Therefore, I support the report and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, one cannot but endorse the draft directive by the two rapporteurs, which should be extended to all Member States for a stronger and firm jurisdiction in order to prosecute and severely punish the perpetrators of the crime that is human trafficking, and also to protect, help and rehabilitate victims, who are overwhelmingly women and children.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, to be more effective and credible in this fight, Europe, as the heir to the history of the European States, should recognise the slave trade and slavery as crimes against humanity, as some Member States have done, and I want to mention France in particular.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the plague of trafficking in human beings is a phenomenon that has taken on particularly worrying dimensions. Whereas originally, it essentially involved women and children being recruited for prostitution, now the victims are people of all ages and both sexes, who are placed into a cycle of exploitation that is not necessarily sexual but also economic. Organised crime networks take advantage of social vulnerability, family difficulties, domestic violence and disabilities to favour immigration, exploiting the people involved through the use of force, abuse and threats.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are in favour of the proposed directive. We need to increase the penalties for traffickers of human beings, confiscating their assets. In addition, there should be a concerted effort by all Member States to strengthen policies preventing trafficking in human beings and training people to identify victims or potential victims.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this report was certainly a major step along the road to fighting trafficking in human beings in general and trafficking in women in particular. The next major step should be to explore the crystal clear relationship and connection between trafficking in women and prostitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the one hand, we rightly talk about trafficking in women as a brutal, terrible crime that we should fight. On the other hand, we talk about prostitution as ‘sex work’, as a service. We talk about pimps and brothel-keepers as entrepreneurs, and we normalise prostitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I want to say is that the client who goes to a brothel, or the client who asks for the services of a prostitute, has basically no way of knowing whether she is a ‘normal’ prostitute – if that even exists since it is another matter whether there is ever consent to prostitution – or a trafficked woman.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is therefore no way of really attacking trafficking without attacking the sex industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you for this important debate. I would like to inform you that today, the Commission will appoint an Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, who will take office in the next month. That person will improve coordination and coherence between the EU institutions and agencies and the Member States, will help ensure that best practices are shared in the different Member States, develop existing and forthcoming policies and be a contact for third countries. This is very important. By bringing together prevention, law enforcement and victim prevention, this person can ensure that appropriate methods to combat trafficking are used and mobilised appropriately. I will ask the Anti-Trafficking Coordinator to liaise closely with the European Parliament and to keep you informed on these developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The criminalisation issue merits a debate in itself, but it is stated in Article 19 of the directive that the Commission will, in some years, submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council ‘assessing the impact of existing national law criminalising the users of services which are the objects of exploitation of trafficking in human beings on the prevention of trafficking in human beings, accompanied, if necessary, by adequate proposals’. We will surely come back to this issue and I do not rule out our having further proposals on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said all this, I think we can be proud of this directive today. It is a very important tool for fighting trafficking and protecting the victims. It has given us an important tool, it has shown the world our commitment to fighting modern slavery and it will strengthen our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to pass on my sincere thanks to the two co-rapporteurs, Ms Bauer and Ms Hedh. Today’s debate has shown how important your work has been, because you have the support of all the groups. I would like to congratulate you on that.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would especially like to thank Mrs Malmström for calling the report an historic text. This statement is probably accurate, as it is the first time that we are adopting a criminal law based on the Treaty of Lisbon, but I should also hope that this is a great step forward in ensuring that not a single perpetrator, not a single perpetrator of human trafficking, can remain unpunished. What was especially reassuring to see in the debate that took place here was the presence of a political will. I myself have frightfully often seen, and have sometimes myself shared the view, that there is a lack of political will to make any serious progress in this area. What I have heard today was the opposite of that, and I would like to thank my fellow Members for exhibiting this political will to take a tremendous step forward in relation to human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We have received two motions for amendment from the EFD, and I would like to ask my fellow Members not to support them, as they intend to reduce the penalty to a minimum. I would also like to thank Mrs Tzavela for requesting the very opposite, that we make the penalty even stricter. I am convinced that this is an important step, but today’s step must be followed by an array of subsequent steps. We have much work to do in combating demand. We can certainly not solve all the problems related to supply, but there is much we could do about demand, and I have a feeling that in this area, the time is not yet ripe, that here, the political will is perhaps insufficient for taking a step forward. I am convinced that the scope of the law will sooner or later need to be extended to third-country perpetrators residing in the EU with a residence permit, as I am also convinced that we will need to review the directive on temporary residence permits to ensure legislative consistency in this area. Thank you very much for your support.</p>

      <p sl="it">Trafficking in human beings – in the various forms that this can take, including sexual exploitation, illegal trading in human organs, forced labour or illegal adoptions – represents a serious violation of the human rights set out in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">The extent of this problem is striking, and experience has shown that the European Union’s current legal framework on the issue is not effective enough. Cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council therefore plays a strategic role in developing a European policy to address this problem effectively.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Treaty of Lisbon strengthened the powers of the European Union regarding judicial and police cooperation between Member States in criminal matters. However, I believe that the penalties for traffickers in human beings still need to be increased and that the assistance given to victims of violence needs to be developed yet further.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree that, in order to discourage demand, it would be a good idea for the European Union and the Member States to make a greater commitment to awareness-raising campaigns in the countries of origin, transit and destination of trafficking. Lastly, I support the appointment of a European Anti-Trafficking Coordinator to manage the European Union’s work and policies in this specific sector.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs for the work they have done, because this historic directive is a very important step in combating the scale of trafficking in human beings, by laying down clear levels of penalties and sanctions. Although numerous EU and national laws have already been adopted and multiannual political commitments have been made in this area, it is calculated that several hundred thousand people are trafficked each year within the EU and beyond its borders. This demonstrates that combating trafficking in human beings, in particular, women and children, remains a huge problem and one of the worst violations of human rights. I would like to emphasise that considering the fact that children are more vulnerable and that they face a greater risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings, particular attention should be paid to this group of victims. Given that trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery and an extremely profitable business for organised crime, more attention must be paid to preventive efforts, the protection of victims and social issues. Furthermore, a hostile environment must be created for human traffickers. The level of penalties and sanctions for people who profit from trafficking in human beings should reflect the gravity of the offence committed and act as an effective deterrent to such activities. In addition to penalties, the Member States should include such sanctions as the seizure of assets and take the necessary measures to seize and confiscate instrumentalities and proceeds from the offences, because then these offences would not be economically viable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Today’s vote on human trafficking comes at a crucial juncture in the ongoing fight against this form of modern-day slavery. As Irish director Ciarán O’Connor outlined last year in his film ‘Trafficked’, which documented the ongoing impact of trafficking in Ireland, it is a crime which is becoming more advanced and more ruthless as authorities fight harder to drive it away. Measures such as this are crucial in order to give authorities the tools and common purpose they need to tackle this Europe-wide problem. At a national level, legislatures need to come down hard on those convicted, and resources must be given to police forces so that it is not for lack of finance or manpower that trafficking is allowed to continue. However, this is a crime without borders, and as such, it is European legislation as much as national laws that will truly put an end to slavery in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Union’s action on trafficking in human beings cannot be limited to denouncing it, but recognises the need for precise, ex-post actions to ensure that those responsible for such a barbaric practice do not go unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="it">These actions include the harmonisation of penalties, as well as the coordination of the interventions provided for by the EU with those already implemented by other international organisations, such as the United Nations. The ex-post actions must be combined with preventive actions, which are just as important. Above all, there must be close cooperation between judicial and financial police authorities to ensure that the economic systems that revolve around these criminal activities are blocked at source and all ramifications cut off.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, it is increasingly important to have accurate and reliable databases that distinguish between the various specificities and provide a starting point for a variety of interventions that contribute to hitting each individual case right at its core. Through this proposal for a directive, the European Union is aiming to attack the entire supply chain of an inhumane trade that tramples on its principles and founding values.</p>

      <p sl="en">The phenomenon of organised crime is something that the European Union needs to tackle head on. We need to be seen as proactive rather than reactive to situations of human trafficking. It is important that we research new emerging ways of human trafficking, in order to intercept and pre-empt emerging human trafficking routes. As a member of the S&amp;D Group, I would like to emphasise that one of our key objectives is to fight cross-border crime. I therefore voted in favour of this legislative initiative. As legislators of the European Union, we must ensure respect for the right to human dignity, the right to integrity, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the prohibition of slavery and forced labour. We cannot allow the trafficking and subsequent auctioning of children to continue. Traffickers are also using Internet recruitment. This is very alarming as many children have access to the Internet.</p>

      <p sl="en">Trafficking in human beings is a crime against human dignity that ruins the lives of many children and women throughout the world. The current proposal is a breakthrough because it puts victims first and tackles the problem in a complex, cross-border manner. These new measures will facilitate the reconnaissance and prosecution of trafficking cases and will encourage victims to cooperate with the authorities. This will be binding legislation, subject to state enforcement. This type of regulation is the only one that can make a difference for all vulnerable people who might fall prey to trafficking. I also call on Member States to follow the proposal in this text and punish those who knowingly accept the services of a victim of trafficking. Fighting demand is key to fighting the roots of trafficking. This report is an excellent proposal, morally and professionally, and I congratulate my distinguished colleagues, Bauer and Hedh, for this. I am particularly happy that the Council and FEMM and LIBE Committees managed to create a text that is backed by all relevant institutions in the EU. I hope that it will soon be formally adopted and transposed into national law. The victims are eager to see it.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The directive relating to human trafficking is an important step forward, because human trafficking is a reality, even in Europe. What is most important is to prevent human trafficking by addressing the problems of poverty and inequality and by making people more aware of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is vitally important to recognise the existence of human trafficking and to help its victims. Victims can be women or men, children or adults. An employee on a construction site could be a victim of human trafficking. The situation surrounding a Roma beggar may match the human trafficking criteria if it is organised and based on compulsion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Unfortunately, often human trafficking is linked to sexualised practices: women and girls end up as prostitutes or they are forced into it. It is important that the victims of human trafficking are given the chance of protection and legal advice.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a result of the harmful tendencies affecting Roma communities – such as low levels of education, deep poverty, marginalisation and discrimination – Roma women and children are extremely vulnerable to trafficking. This modern-day slavery is deeply rooted in poverty and exclusion and, therefore, the elimination of the unacceptable living conditions that many Roma face must be a major strategic objective. Furthermore, the EU and the authorities of the Member States must take much more vigorous action to combat this phenomenon, particularly regarding the eradication of organised crime and the protection of groups at risk, namely women and minors of minority origin.</p>
      <p sl="en">This initiative aims to adopt a broader concept of what should be considered trafficking and I believe that exploitation for begging, including the use of a trafficked-dependent person for begging, regardless of his or her relationship with the perpetrators, must fall within this scope. Penalties should be more severe when the offence is committed against persons vulnerable on grounds of age, gender, pregnancy, health conditions, or disability, and must pay due account of cases where the victim has been subjected to torture, the forced administration of drugs or medication, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical and sexual violence.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In today’s debate, I should like to touch on the problem of child trafficking. We should make every effort to develop and improve the legal and institutional systems and childcare systems in all Member States. The scope of activities covered by the term human trafficking should be revised and extended. This is the only way we will be able to prevent problems such as: 1) commercial adoption, or, in other words, private adoption involving the relinquishment of rights to the child before the family courts, most frequently for payment; 2) pregnant women leaving the country and returning with no child; 3) the disappearance of children whose parents have died in countries affected by armed conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Given that a good many crimes are now committed via the Internet, it is worth appointing special interdisciplinary teams specialised in fighting this type of crime. They would deal not only with the surveillance of criminal milieu, but also the collection of evidence by means of monitoring the financial situations of individuals involved in trafficking children. We should train public officials and make them more aware of the situation of children in families from which children may be trafficked. This applies particularly to services working with families receiving state assistance due to difficult material circumstances. The only way we will have any chance of eliminating or at least limiting human trafficking and, in particular, child trafficking, is by means of multilateral and harmonised measures, taken at the level of the 27 Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks are inherent to possible terrorist attacks, industrial accidents or natural disasters. Incidents of this kind, whether accidental or criminal in origin, know no borders and are potentially devastating for human lives, infrastructure, the environment and public health. They do not occur just in remote areas: we need only recall the recent disaster caused by the leak of toxic sludge from a factory in Hungary and the series of letter-bombs posted from Yemen to various addresses in the United States and Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is crucial for the European Union to make every effort to develop the necessary cooperation between the Member States’ civilian and military capabilities and resources in order to prevent, detect and respond effectively to CBRN attacks or disasters. Such cooperation requires a special European crisis-response mechanism, working in collaboration with a European civil protection force. In fact, this House has long been calling for such a force to be established.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU Action Plan therefore needs strengthening. The existing plan, which the Council approved in 2009, is weak and, in practice, is not being implemented by all Member States. It just needs one link to crack for the whole chain of intervention to fail. It is vital to give the Commission a stronger monitoring, guiding and coordinating role, and the plan urgently needs to be implemented in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report proposes greater civilian-military cooperation in terms of pooling efforts for CBRN disaster prevention, detection, preparation and response. The EU has to bring all the Member States together to put in place integrated national systems for implementing the plan. In this respect, the CBRN Action Plan is an opportunity to put the Treaty of Lisbon solidarity clause into practice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We have already been negotiating this text for a year. For a start, I would like to tell you that we had reached an agreement with the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. I then discovered at the last moment that voting advice had been given that totally contradicted the agreements we had reached. I discovered that the agreements that we had with the ALDE Group have not been adhered to. We went to plenary with agreements that had not been honoured.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, Mr Cercas is proposing that we amend – I would like to be able to speak, otherwise there is no point – the Socialist Group, and Mr Cercas in particular, are proposing that the Commission amend its proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But, Mr Cercas, we have now been discussing this for a year. You are proposing a number of things. For a year now, we have failed to reach an agreement. So, what is the point of starting all over again? We could debate for 10 years, Mr Cercas, and you would still disagree. We have tried everything possible and you have never agreed with anyone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not see, therefore, how submitting more proposals will mean that we move forward. That is a real shame. You opposed migrants entering the European Union. The Socialist Group is denying these migrants the same treatment as that enjoyed by European workers.</p>

The South Caucasus and Georgia are regions that are strategically important for the EU. My country, Lithuania, has always had a special relationship with Georgia. We supported it at the most difficult moments and not simply at state level as a government. There was always huge public support for this country. I believe that the whole of the European Union wants Georgia to join the family of European nations. This country has made huge efforts to be part of Europe and therefore, we must assess them accordingly. Visa facilitation will help to ensure people’s mobility, their cooperation and, at the same time, both economic and cultural links.

Local authorities, which are most aware of the needs of their region, play a key role in this regard. Attention should also be paid to cross-border areas, in order to facilitate their integration. In order for there to be proper vertical and horizontal cooperation, procedures must be streamlined, and more money spent on the training of specialists from implementing bodies in the individual Member States.

      <p sl="it">In order for the regional development policies to be more effective, we need to involve those who know their own regions and can help drive their development. That is the link between multi-level governance and territorial cohesion highlighted by the rapporteur.</p>

I voted on the course of good governance laid out by Parliament because I agree that the key to the progress of our countries lies in closer regional cooperation. It is therefore desirable to call upon the Member States to make better use of the available forms of cooperation across regional borders. Priority multi-level governance is precisely what may help local regional authorities and the private and public sectors to find each other.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The idea formulated with regard to implementation, according to which the local and regional authorities must also be involved in policy making, also deserves support. The large number of participants involved in the policy at Community, national, regional and local level represents both opportunities and uncertainties.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, firstly, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Mǎnescu, for her excellent work. It is very important to point out that there is a need for good governance in regional policy. In my opinion, good governance mainly involves the principles of fairness and impartiality. We need to look at the European Union as an entity and not just cherry-pick and provide support for certain areas only. The whole of Europe must be developed impartially, and we also have to ensure that that can and will be done, using the tools of regional policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am also very concerned that when we look at the criteria for regional policy and funding, it should not just be GDP that we consider. That is not a sustainable criterion in itself, as we will be examining remote regions in the EU, and for that reason, it is important to include the notions of sparsely populated areas and long distances.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the immigration issue is a very topical one throughout the European Union. For that reason, it is very important that we create a network of liaison officers. We also need to try and act in a way where we are becoming more objective in these matters in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Recently, however, there have been worrying examples of our failures in some aspects of immigration policy. People who have arrived in Europe and settled here have not been prepared to accept fundamental European values. Accordingly, as Europeans, we need to ensure, in particular, that those core values, on which the whole of the European Union is built, are preserved, and that they are adhered to. They include democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion. It is these that we especially need to uphold.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For that reason, alongside the creation of a liaison officer network, it is also important to establish codes of ethics and values for it, as a point of reference when immigration policy is being laid down. It is important that migrants can integrate and accept fundamental European values when they are resident in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, human trafficking is a very serious issue. Since 2008, 35 people have been rescued from exploitation in my own constituency of Northern Ireland; 25 of these were rescued in 2009. However, no one has yet been convicted of an offence of human trafficking. It is a form of modern-day slavery, a serious crime and a violation of a person’s fundamental human rights. Indeed, many of the women taken or rescued in Northern Ireland are from the Far East and are there through organised crime gangs who are making huge profits and exploiting these people both for labour and sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="en">While there are many valuable aspects to this report, and I believe that this is an area where there can be considerable cooperation between national police forces – indeed the police force of Northern Ireland has been leading the way in this – I abstained in the eventual vote because I firmly believe that the setting of minimum tariffs is a matter for the Member State alone.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, currently, human trafficking is one of the biggest and most crucial issues and one of the most serious threats facing the European Union. We need to recognise the problem and admit that there is one, even if often, it is as if we were hiding behind the notion that we have already resolved it. Unfortunately, that is not the case. We need to ensure that the fundamental rights of each person can become a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The term ‘human trafficking’ is something of a misnomer, because there is nothing human about it. It is an appalling business, where people are stripped of the one-time chance of life and of human dignity. Women and children are in the special risk group. Prostitution and the trade in organs are the most glaring examples of this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would like to call on the European Union actually to start to act – not just talk, but act – to bring human trafficking in the European Union to a complete end, using this report as a point of reference. We need to take action to fight against it properly, using the sanctions that would ensure that each person would have a chance to preserve their human dignity and enjoy a good life.</p>

Every trade involves a buyer and these are often people from the rich democratic countries, and they may be our neighbours. The report pays attention to victims, but we must do more, we must open our eyes and notice what is happening around us, so that people who see no way out of their poverty never become victims.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I asked for the floor to give an explanation of vote on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings.</p>
      <p sl="it">Obviously, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Bauer because the fight against trafficking in human beings is, and must remain, one of our priorities. This problem has grown to such an extent that it can be called a new form of slavery. The most vulnerable parts of society – women and children – are taken abroad and exploited through the most abominable forms of prostitution, slavery and pornography.</p>
      <p sl="it">Each year, this phenomenon has 1 million victims around the world and 500 000 in Europe alone. Those who take advantage of this phenomenon are committing a criminal act, financing the trafficking of human beings and using people as goods to be bought and sold.</p>
      <p sl="it">As the report emphasises, we need to take action in the countries where the victims of trafficking come from and where they are moved to. We will only be able to find a solution through a common effort, by carrying out collective awareness raising and supporting and assisting the victims and, above all, by fighting the root causes of this phenomenon so as to help those countries involved to develop suitable legislation to combat all forms of slavery.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wanted to explain why my group and I abstained on the vote on the EU rapid response capability. The multiplication of major disasters outside the EU in recent years has led to increased calls to improve the effectiveness of the EU disaster response capacity.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, many EU citizens are still not aware of the significance of cohesion policy for the development not only of individual regions, but also of entire countries. Its main task is to create a level playing field for regions within the European Union. As a result, populations from less privileged regions with difficult farming conditions and poor access to communications benefit from the same level of access to social, education, transport and energy services as the citizens of areas enjoying better social and economic positions. The idea of cohesion is therefore one whose significance cannot be overestimated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must therefore support all measures aimed at making better use of money granted under the Structural Funds and at making more effective use of its integrating role, all the more so because the effects of cohesion policy measures are most keenly felt at local level and, therefore, to a significant extent in rural areas too. These are the reasons why I voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to talk about the Luhan report, which is the final topic in today’s debate.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Competitiveness and cohesion are elements which complement and support one another. The competitiveness of the EU as a whole, however, can be secured only if economic growth is genuinely sustainable. Many investments co-financed from the Structural Funds have proved their worth, among which I would like to emphasise infrastructure improvement, because it has resulted in foreign investment being attracted into many regions, contributing to economic development. Cohesion policy, however, has also proved its worth in a time of financial crisis as an effective instrument for responding flexibly to new socio-economic challenges.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also agree with the rapporteur’s view that the economic competitiveness of EU regions is closely connected with the average level of employment, the education and qualifications of the workforce, social security and access to public services, because support for social cohesion is of key importance for overall regional competitiveness, even on a global scale.</p>

The Portuguese authorities officially estimated the damage caused by the floods in Madeira at EUR 1.08 billion. The Solidarity Fund is contributing about EUR 31 million.

      <p sl="fr">On the basis of the report by my esteemed German colleague, Mr Böge, I voted for the proposal for a decision by the European Parliament and of the Council on mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 67 million to help Madeira (Portugal), which was hit by landslides and floods, as well as France, affected by floods following storm Xynthia in February 2010. I note that the amount represents 2.7% of an estimated EUR 2.5 billion of total direct damage. Of course, this is a substantial amount of funding, but given that it is a relatively small proportion of the total damage (2.7%), I cannot help but wonder whether the European Union should not use this fund to finance a European civil protection force which could immediately come to the aid of disaster victims, in order to cope with extremely acute situations that are beyond the capabilities of national forces. This force would not be very expensive because, initially, it would involve coordinating existing national civil protection forces. In addition it could be used for missions abroad (such as Haiti).</p>

      <p sl="pt">We, of course, voted in favour of this report, which proposes mobilising the Solidarity Fund to address the enormous damage that occurred on the island of Madeira following the storm that struck the region in February 2010. Nonetheless, we would like to reiterate some remarks here.</p>
      <p sl="pt">According to the Solidarity Fund Regulation, ‘in the event of major disasters, the Community should show its solidarity with the population of the regions concerned by providing financial assistance to contribute to a rapid return to normal living conditions in the disaster-stricken regions’. The regulation also states that this instrument should enable the Community ‘to act swiftly and efficiently to help, as quickly as possible, in mobilising emergency services to meet people’s immediate needs and contribute to the short-term restoration of damaged key infrastructure’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the rules and procedures involved in mobilising the fund have already shown that this principle of helping the affected populations quickly is not being observed in practice. In this case, this House is only voting to mobilise the fund 10 months after the disaster. That is why we have argued – and we do so again now – that the rules for mobilising this fund need to be adjusted to allow for more flexible and timely mobilisation and to reduce the time that elapses between the disaster and the point at which the funds are made available.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In my view, the EU Solidarity Fund, like the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, is one of the budgetary tools that give the strongest practical expression to the ‘solidarity’ value that we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strive to promote when drafting Community policies. On 27 and 28 February 2010, storm Xynthia killed 53 and injured around 80 in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. It was a genuinely traumatic experience for the region and the nation, and its psychological and economic impact is still being felt 10 months later. As from the March 2010 plenary session, Parliament took action, adopting by a very large majority a resolution calling for the fund to be used to provide assistance to the victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today’s vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens. This is the Europe we wish to build, a Europe close to its citizens, alert to the issues affecting them, and capable of addressing those issues collectively.</p>

Today’s vote responds to the request by the French authorities for these regions to receive, among other things, European financial assistance for an ‘extraordinary disaster, mainly a natural one, affecting the major part of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and the economic stability of the region’. Of the estimated EUR 1 425.43 million of direct damage caused by the disaster, EUR 35 635.750 will be paid out to France. The mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund is a practical expression of a Europe that is close to its citizens, which is what they expect.

I believe that the sum of more than EUR 250 million that is being requested as additional assistance and aid for the more than 600 employees made redundant from the retail sector in the Netherlands can help to achieve the ultimate goal of facilitating the reintegration of these workers into the labour market. I also voted in favour because I am convinced that this assistance complements the redundancy aid provided for in all national legislation and collective agreements.

This is in response to the request made by the French Government following storm Xynthia, which hit the French coast on 27 and 28 February 2010, leaving 53 people dead and 80 injured in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. The procedure is undoubtedly long and in need of improvement, but I am pleased to see European solidarity being shown in this way, in the face of the tragedy the victims have experienced. I had written to Commissioner Hahn to support the French Government’s request for aid, and he has honoured the commitment he made to me during his visit to La Rochelle in early March. This fund is more than much-needed financial assistance; it symbolises the common values shared by our continent.</p>

The European Union Solidarity Fund is the ideal instrument for supporting local efforts. By voting for this text, I have helped to release EUR 35 635 750, earmarked not for compensation of damage suffered by private individuals, but for infrastructure rehabilitation. Created following the 2002 floods in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and France, the Solidarity Fund is meant to assist European regions affected by unforeseeable disasters. This text also allocates an equivalent amount to the areas affected by recent flooding in Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As we vote on this draft amending budget, which will allow for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in favour of the people of Madeira and the regions of France affected by the storm Xynthia – which, of course, we supported – it is important to highlight a few points here, in addition to the delay in mobilising the fund, which we mentioned previously.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission believes that the eligibility criteria for mobilisation have been met, particularly, in Madeira’s case, as regards the threshold for damage. It should be noted, however, that the Union support now made available will only cover 2.89% of the total damage caused by the disaster. Madeira is an outermost region and, hence, has to bear the resulting constraints. It is also pursuing convergence objectives (despite the damaging changes in this field since the last enlargement). These particular characteristics ought, therefore, to be taken into account by increasing support for the region, either from this fund or through other measures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Consequently, when the rules of the fund were being discussed, we proposed considering the idea of increasing financial assistance to cohesion countries and convergence regions by introducing an indispensable cohesion dimension into this question of providing support for damage caused by natural disasters. That would also reduce the disparities between the various regions and Member States in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">At a time when we are facing ever more frequent natural disasters in Europe, the European Union must be able to provide appropriate aid to its Member States when one of them is hit by a disaster of this kind. Consequently, following storm Xynthia in March, which hit the coastal areas of Charente-Maritime and Vendée, and the floods that affected the island of Madeira in Portugal in February, it was only natural that I should approve the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund in order to compensate for the damage caused by these disasters. To my mind, this vote illustrates the solidarity that exists between the nations of Europe, and which should exist in many other areas too, for that matter.</p>

After verifying that both applications meet the eligibility criteria of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal (flooding in Madeira) and EUR 35 635 750 for France (storm Xynthia), resulting in a total amount of EUR 66 891 540 to be deducted from the ceiling of EUR 1 billion in commitment and payment appropriations.

      <p sl="en">According to Article 37(1) of the Financial Regulation, the Commission may present draft amending budgets if there are ‘unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances’. On this aspect, and regarding the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Portugal and France on the basis of point 26 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA). The IIA allows the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion. The conditions for eligibility to the fund are detailed here as well as in Council Regulation No 2012/2002 establishing the EUSF. It is important to note that the objective of the fund is not to compensate private damage but to repair infrastructure and is a tool for refinancing.

The plant in question is Mura, European Fashion Design, which has laid off 2 554 workers. I find it strange that 583, or 22.8%, of the 2 554 workers made redundant in total have a long-standing health problem or disability. I am not sure they fulfil EGF criteria. It should be noted that 1 114 of the 2 554 dismissed workers ‘have not concluded primary school education’. It is legitimate to question the educational level of those recruited and their suitability with respect to current industrial standards. I question the independence of the civil servants at the Slovenian Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs who have to assume the role of certification authority for supervising this expenditure.</p>

In light of structural changes in international trade, it is important that the European economy is able to quickly implement assistance policies for workers affected by such changes whilst also giving them the skills required to return swiftly to the labour market. Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis. It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities normally incumbent upon companies, nor is it intended for the financing and restructuring of companies. Given that Slovenia has requested assistance in respect of 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company that operates in the wearing apparel sector in the NUTS III region of Pomurje, and that 7% of all people employed in the region of Pomurje were working for Mura and incomes in this region were already below the Slovenian average, I am voting overall in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Slovenia.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The number of times in recent months that this House has approved the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which was set up to provide additional support for workers suffering from the consequences of major changes in the structure of world trade, is, in my view, highly indicative of the crisis that Europe is going through. The EGF is not the answer to this crisis, but it is a considerable, significant help. In this specific case, the aid is intended to address the consequences of 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company in Slovenia that operates in the wearing apparel sector. This sector has been particularly badly affected by changes in the structure of world trade and is the victim of cheap textile imports.</p>

It is in this context that this intervention plan for Slovenia is being put forward, in relation to 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company operating in the wearing apparel sector. I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects to implement measures to speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation.

The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of company relocations, and it is fundamental in facilitating their access to new employment. The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Slovenia, which has applied for assistance for 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company operating in the wearing apparel sector.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European citizens and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, and, at the same time, developing a new, skilled workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy. It is in this context that this intervention plan for Germany is being put forward, in relation to 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector.

It is important to me that these people receive these funds quickly and without significant bureaucratic frictional losses. The assistance is needed now and not in six months’ or a year’s time.

      <p sl="de">Apart from the application from the enterprise Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, I have, without reservations, voted in favour of all of the applications for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund that have been voted on today, as I support the general idea of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and, in particular, the direct support given to the people who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation. However, with regard to the aforementioned enterprise, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, I abstained from the vote. In this case, I have definite reservations. It is well-known that Heidelberger Druckmaschinen is a jewel of the German mechanical engineering sector. The company made excellent profits for many years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then, admittedly, came two or three financially difficult years. Heidelberger Druckmaschinen reacted with the reflex typical of large companies: it reduced staff numbers in the area where wages were high, in other words, in Germany, and, at the same time, invested and increased the number of staff in China, where wages were low. If, during such a process, an application is made for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, this represents a negative example of how a socially meaningful and very responsible EU measure is exploited by international companies to wheedle out of their social responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On the basis of the report by my Italian colleague, Barbara Matera, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of EUR 0.6 million in aid to Poland, which is facing redundancies in the automotive sector. Five hundred and ninety workers have been made redundant from two companies within the automotive industry. I support the fact that this aid is being managed and controlled by the bodies responsible for the European Social Fund (ESF) in Poland, thereby limiting monitoring costs to a mere EUR 2 000. Like Mrs Matera, I congratulate the Commission on the fact that, in the context of mobilising the EGF, it has proposed an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused ESF funds. Nonetheless, I regret the fact that, in order to mobilise the EGF in favour of this case, payment appropriations have been taken from a budget heading designed to support SMEs and innovation.

This autonomous community has a population density of less than the EU average (112 inhabitants per square kilometre); its traditional economy is growing cereals and rearing sheep; its retail trade has suffered 1 154 redundancies from 593 businesses in a nine-month period; 56% of people in its service sector were unemployed in February 2010, 73% of whom were women; 73.9% of workers made redundant were sales assistants in shops and markets; 14.4% were doing unskilled jobs.

      <p sl="pt">Assistance to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation must be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively. In the light of structural changes to international trade, it is important for the European economy to quickly implement instruments to aid workers affected by such changes, whilst also giving them the skills required for their swift reintegration into the labour market. On this basis, financial assistance should be provided on an individual basis. It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for companies’ normal responsibilities, nor is it intended to finance companies or lead to their restructuring. Given that Spain has requested assistance for 300 individuals who have lost their jobs at 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products) in the region of Comunidad Valenciana, overall, I am voting in favour of this report or, put another way, in favour of mobilising the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support Spain.</p>

The Commission’s assessment was based on: the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis; the unforeseen nature of the redundancies concerned; demonstration of the number of redundancies and compliance with the criteria of Article 2(a); the explanation of the unforeseen nature of those redundancies; the identification of dismissing enterprises and workers targeted for assistance, the territory concerned and its authorities and stakeholders; the impact of the redundancies as regards local, regional or national employment; the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded, including its compatibility with actions funded by the Structural Funds; dates on which the personalised services to affected workers were started or planned to start; procedures for consulting the social partners, management and control systems. In accordance with the Commission’s assessment, the application fulfils the eligibility criteria set up by the EGF Regulation and I therefore support it.</p>

The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of companies relocating and is crucial in facilitating access to new jobs.

A second proposal for financial assistance upon which we are voting today relates to several hundred more lay-offs in the same region. There is therefore a huge amount of upheaval on the local market in this region of Poland. I am delighted that the European Commission has confirmed that the application meets the conditions required for the granting of financial support. As a result, the laid-off workers will be able either to get back their old jobs or find new ones, and the owners of the businesses will make use of the support to mitigate the negative effects of the global crisis and to maintain their place in the market.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Poland. The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market. Today’s vote concerned a request for assistance for 658 redundancies (of which 189 have been targeted for assistance) at H. Cegielski-Poznań and four of its suppliers, enterprises which operate in the sector concerned with the manufacture of marine diesel engines in the cities of Poznań and Poviat, amounting to a total of EUR 114 250 financed by the EGF.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I would note that the adoption of today’s reports once again shows the importance of the EGF, which is a valuable resource to assist workers in difficulties due to the economic crisis and is also an effective tool for combating unemployment.</p>

This aid is essential in helping the unemployed and victims of the relocations occurring in an era of globalisation.

The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of companies relocating and is crucial in facilitating access to new jobs. The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is appropriate for providing aid to Poland, which has presented a request for assistance relating to the 189 redundancies at H.

Once they have this permit, they will enjoy similar rights to the rest of citizens and will be able, for example, to move around and settle in any EU state (apart from the UK, Denmark and Ireland).

I therefore supported Claude Moraes’s report, which, among other things, has made it possible to further strengthen the guarantees against ‘refoulement’ and, despite the reservations expressed, to arrive at the favourable figure of five years’ residence. Another significant fact to be welcomed is that this is the only text of the ‘asylum package’ to have ultimately been adopted under the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and this in spite of the commitments made at the beginning of its mandate. Therefore, we need to continue to work hard to ensure that the Common European Asylum System, founded, inter alia , on common procedures and reception conditions, finally becomes a reality within the Union.

The fact that after five years of legal residence, beneficiaries of international protection are to have rights comparable to those of EU nationals has raised problems and questions, particularly in those EU states with strong social systems, which will give rise to inestimable costs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Extension of the area of application to include refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection can only serve to burden the public purse even more. We must, in particular, always take into account the enticement to refugees, in other words, the fact that the measures intended to provide protection and financial security are exactly those that represent an incentive for many economic migrants to immigrate illegally into Europe on the pretext of seeking asylum from inhumane and life-threatening conditions.

      <p sl="de">After residing in a Member State for five years, refugees are to be granted a long-term residence permit, which is then to apply throughout the whole of the EU. Since the asylum systems in the different Member States have different levels of stringency, a well-advised refugee would settle initially in the Member State that has the most lenient asylum law with the most loopholes. After five years, he can then leave his place of residence and move to any other Member State of the European Union of his choosing. The result is secondary migration from countries with low standards to Member States with generous social systems. People will first choose the Member States according to the stringency of the asylum law and then according to the level of social services.

I agree with the European Parliament’s position that agreements concluded between the Union and Georgia, such as that on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and on the facilitation of the issuance of visas, are, first of all, a very important stage, a step forward in relations between the European Union and Georgia. Furthermore, these agreements are also relevant from a regional point of view and will support EU efforts to enhance cooperation with other countries in the region.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union has speeded up the process of opening up to the states of the South Caucasus ever since its expansion towards Eastern Europe, at a time when this region has become extremely important from a strategic, stability and security perspective. Europe now has a duty to the countries in this region. Its commitment is clear, especially given the proximity of these countries to the EU’s eastern border. Apart from the economic and commercial potential offered by these states, the agreement between the EU and Georgia on the facilitation of issuance of visas to citizens from this state is also a measure for encouraging democracy in this country. It is important for the EU to export the principles of good governance, fair justice and total respect for human rights. This action will also be boosted by the two agreements signed recently with Georgia. One concerns the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and the other the facilitated issuance of visas.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Waiving the compulsory requirement for Georgian citizens to have visas will mark an important step on the road to bringing them closer to Europe.

By its actions, that country has confirmed that it wishes to be a partner of a modern international society, one that does not shirk taking responsibility. Georgia has achieved much in a short time. It has substantially improved its governing structures, attracted significant investment and significantly reduced corruption. I consider the facilitated issuance of visas to be an essential step in opening up new opportunities for study to Georgian citizens, and in allowing Georgian entrepreneurs to make new contacts with entrepreneurs in European Union Member States. In this way, we shall all be winners, but Georgia’s citizens most of all. Just as we Europeans take pride in our achievements, our history and cultural values, so Georgians take pride in their country, its natural beauty and ancient culture.

      <p sl="de">An agreement with Georgia would bring a wave of bogus asylum seekers. Thus, we first need to dispel our security concerns. As the experience with the Balkans shows, visa-free travel is not just used for travel to the EU, but also sets a real stream of asylum shopping in motion. It is to be feared that the same thing would also happen in the case of visa facilitation for Georgian citizens. In general, the facilitation of the issuance of visas to citizens of non-EU states should not be granted too hastily. Before doing so, it must be examined as carefully as possible whether appropriate readmission agreements for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants could prevent the abuse of the system.</p>

It is becoming more and more urgent to create a European rapid response capability, or ‘European civil protection force’, as Mr Barnier has suggested. Clearly, the coordination of national civil protection forces seems to be a useful means of assisting a Member State which could not cope on its own with a large-scale disaster (fire, flood, natural disaster, and so on). This European civil protection force would also be very useful for intervening in external situations such as in Haiti.

Clear agreements and procedures should therefore be established to ensure a dual visibility (for both the Member States and the European Union) for civil protection assets deployed by Member States through the EU civil protection mechanism. Another problem with EU response concerns coordination and, therefore, the European Parliament trusts that in future, the European External Action Service will create a single crisis response, which will require a rationalisation of the existing crisis platforms.

      <p sl="ro">A rapid response agency for dealing with emergencies would make the European Union’s interventions in the event of natural or accidental disasters much more coherent and effective. The European Union clearly intervened rapidly and responded to real needs in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti. However, it is also just as obvious that we need to learn from real situations and improve the service we give every time. The earthquake in Haiti was immediately followed by a period of confusion over who should take the lead for the coordination of the EU’s overall action. In the future, it is expected that the EEAS will create a single crisis response, which will require streamlining of the existing crisis platforms.</p>

The limits of the current civil defence mechanism were apparent, for example, in the reaction to this year’s crisis in Haiti, which was relatively flexible and extensive, but, on the other hand, suffered from a lack of efficiency, coordination and visibility. It was also unclear who was supposed to lead coordination of the overall EU operation. In view of the extent of the crisis, High Representative Ashton finally secured the coordination of EU assistance in close cooperation with Commissioner Georgieva, who is responsible for humanitarian assistance, civil defence and international cooperation. I see scope for extending the operational ability of the EU to cope with catastrophes, particularly through the creation of a permanently available civilian capability which will operate independently of military structures, and in the creation of budgets and research and industrial potential (for example, satellite imaging in the GMES programme).</p>

The European Union, with the 27 Member States acting collectively, is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid and development aid. We have at our disposal a vast array of civil and military resources to meet emergency and reconstruction needs. However, as long as there are still national knee-jerk responses, we will unfortunately be unable to derive any real benefit from this virtual collective force.

      <p sl="pt">Rapid response to catastrophes and natural disasters is essential, since it is in the first few hours following such an event that the greatest number of people can be saved. Furthermore, in recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in disasters, whether natural or man-made, and these require a high level of technical expertise and coordination of the different means of responding to disasters. The creation of a Community Mechanism for Civil Protection may be a first step but I agree with the rapporteur that there is more to be done in this area. EU coordination and cooperation on rapid and effective response to disasters can be very successful, as it was in the case of the Haitian earthquake in January 2010. It is essential that the response should be of this kind.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Natural disasters can and must be prevented. Factors such as intensive soil use, poorly planned urban growth, rural flight and desertification, among others, are the causes of an increased risk of disasters. The promotion of sensible land use, and of economic and social development in harmony with nature, is a vital factor in disaster prevention. It is, above all, in this respect that the EU should intensify its efforts, implementing the recommendations made in a recent Parliamentary report and strengthening this aspect of its cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to responses to those disasters which cannot be prevented, there is also clearly a place for strengthening cooperation, mutual assistance and intervention between the various Member States and third countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The best forms and means of achieving this must be the result of a debate involving the various national civil protection and other authorities, whilst respecting the sovereignty of each Member State. This should be the path set out by the report, not the ‘immediate establishment of an EU Civil Protection Force’ or the use of military means in response to humanitarian aid situations, which the report admits could act without being under the aegis and coordination of the UN.</p>

      <p sl="it">As we will all remember, although the European response in providing aid to the people of Haiti was swift and on a large scale, it highlighted a number of critical problems in the management, coordination and visibility of the operation, which are down to the mechanics of the current system, which is based on voluntary and ad hoc contributions subject to different national decision-making processes.</p>
      <p sl="it">The recent European Commission communication on the role of civil protection and humanitarian support aims precisely to lay the foundations for an effective and coherent synergy of the actions already taken at national, regional and local levels. The Treaty of Lisbon provides the opportunity to develop a more thorough, coordinated and functional disaster response capacity. The time has therefore come to speed up the process that will equip the EU with a modern and efficient civil protection capability.</p>

The creation of a rapid response force will enable the EU and the Member States to better coordinate their efforts and give better visibility to EU activity.

It must not be the goal of this rapid reaction unit to promote the EU throughout the world.

Another example is the recent large-scale environmental accident which occurred in Hungary. Faced with such incidents, no state has the capacity to respond at a sufficiently high level on its own.

      <p sl="en">The multiplication of major disasters (natural/man-made) outside the European Union in recent years has led to increased calls to improve the effectiveness of the existing EU disaster-response capacity. If the EU disaster-response capacity has constantly evolved since the establishment of the Community civil protection mechanism in 2001, the rapporteur believes that much more needs to be done to ensure a coordinated, coherent and visible EU response. This need for a more coherent response was also highlighted in the latest communication from the Commission on ‘reinforcing the Union’s disaster response capacity’, which dates back to March 2008. This communication was supposed to be a first step on the road to a comprehensive and integrated EU response. It included an action plan with a number of practical actions to gradually build up more integrated coordination between the various instruments for disaster response.

      <p sl="nl">Now that, because of climate change, the number of natural disasters across the world resulting in serious humanitarian, economic and environmental damage has increased, it is imperative that the European Union is able to act quickly. The creation of a European civil protection force provides a clear structure for this kind of rapid response. After the earthquake in Haiti, we have learned the lesson that we need to increase the efficiency, coordination and visibility of the Union. I am therefore in favour of civil protection and humanitarian aid being brought together under the portfolio of a single Commissioner. I also believe that, where possible, humanitarian relief operations should always be carried out under the coordinating umbrella of the UN.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this report, the Commission has been invited to set up programmes in the affected areas, working together with national governments, local authorities and NGOs, in order to enable local communities to prevent and manage disasters.

      <p sl="pt">The incidence of natural and man-made disasters has been increasing, not only in number but also in impact and scale and, as a result, in terms of human, socio-economic and environmental impact. This obliges the EU to rethink its response strategy in terms of prevention, management and assistance, so that it becomes more concerted and efficient in operational terms.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the adoption of this report, which uses the recent disaster in Haiti as a case study and calls for the creation of a European Union Civil Protection Force capable of creating synergies between the Member States and European institutions in order to prevent disasters and assist third countries, especially any developing country that has been struck by a disaster. The humanitarian nature of this initiative is representative of the increasingly concrete nature of the external dimensions of EU solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I believe that it is extremely important for this same initiative to be regarded as leading to the coordination and management of those disasters which occur inside the European Union. I recall the disaster which devastated the island of Madeira last February and, on that basis, I consider it essential to create this Civil Protection Force whilst, at the same time, making best possible use of existing mechanisms.</p>

Thanks to the introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which promotes competition between trading venues for execution services, the efficiency of the price formation process has increased, widening choice for investors. Market fragmentation has, however, led to poor post-trade transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) trades and this situation means a more effective regulatory framework for consolidated post-trade information is required. In my opinion, regulators need to ensure that they can, at any time, recreate every detail of the trade in order to understand the market dynamics and the participants’ involvement. The impact of new technology and the advent of new market participants has led to faster trading speeds and to an increase in direct market access by clients of trading platform members. Although the introduction of MiFID brought innovation, it seems that it also contributed to the fragmentation of the market.

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report because I believe that it is essential for the EU to be prepared for the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks which have given a new dimension to terrorist attacks, to industrial accidents and to natural disasters, since such risks know no borders and could result in innumerable victims. The response of the EU to this danger should not be limited to ex post facto intervention programmes but starts much earlier when dealing with the proper storage of, limiting of access to, and controls of such materials. I consider it essential that intervention following an incident should be matched by significant cooperation between the different authorities of a Member State (civil protection, military, police, etc.), as well as between the national authorities of the various Member States and European institutions. In other words, I consider a coordinated and comprehensive approach to be essential. In June 2009, the Commission tabled a three-year EU CBRN Action Plan for 2010-2012, with the following elements: prevention, detection, and preparedness and response. In this regard, I believe that recognising the importance of each of these stages is crucial to ensure the proper implementation of risk assessment studies, response and counter measures.</p>

It is necessary to start dealing with such materials, and their proper storage, limited access, controls, etc., from the very beginning and not just create ex post facto intervention programmes. At the same time, aftermath intervention demands large-scale cooperation between different national authorities inside a Member State. Therefore, the CBRN Action Plan should ensure the efficient interaction of national and EU initiatives in addressing CBRN risks and preparing the necessary response.</p>

We must also take into consideration, while reassessing the EU CBRN Action Plan, the suggestions put forward by Parliament, aimed at improving the basic areas which improve security in the event of such risks.

      <p sl="lt">Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear disasters, whether accidental or resulting from a terrorist attack, pose serious threats to the security and health of EU citizens and are the cause of environmental pollution and contamination. Although the number of incidents in the EU involving CBRN material has so far been relatively small and have been due to industrial accidents or to the increase in, and worldwide spread of, dangerous pathogens, there remains a risk of CBRN disasters, whether accidental or intentional. I voted for this report because I agree with the rapporteur’s position that the CBRN Action Plan proposed by the European Commission, the goal of which is to ensure the efficient interaction of national and EU initiatives in addressing CBRN risks and preparing the necessary response, underestimates the risks which are not confined by the EU’s borders.

      <p sl="pt">It is essential that we adopt an effective Action Plan so that we can confront the existing and continuing risk of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) disasters within EU territory. Whether accidental or intentional, these represent a serious threat and have the potential to cause devastating and far-reaching effects on the security, welfare and health of the European public, as well as on the environment, our cultural heritage and basic infrastructure. Fortunately, the number of incidents related to CBRN materials, including acts of terrorism, has been relatively low.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Action Plan shows the need for a comprehensive and transnational response, since the effects of a CBRN disaster know no borders and such a plan should be based on the following elements: prevention, detection, and preparedness and response. It should also ensure effective interaction between national and EU initiatives in order to tackle CBRN risks and prepare capabilities to respond to and limit the consequences. Like the rapporteur, Mrs Gomes, I have no doubt that we need to adopt an EU Action Plan but I regret the fact that the Commission has not been more ambitious, because the proposed Action Plan shows a lack of strength and coherence on certain matters.</p>

      <p sl="pt">If there were genuine concern regarding chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats, there would be no insistence by certain EU countries on maintaining extremely powerful nuclear arsenals that could be used in military attacks.

      <p sl="pt">The report makes no reference to certain decisions such as that recently taken by the UK to sell nuclear technology to India, a country which is not a signatory to the NPT, nor to the decision by France and Germany to cooperate in the maintenance of their nuclear weapons, justifying this by a hypocritical ‘cost rationalisation’.

Such work can require several years, but it must be carried out. The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, cannot draw up such a document on its own.

Although prevention and protection from disasters caused by the substances mentioned is an issue for the Member States themselves, we need a common approach. This European Commission communication is a step towards a common action plan aiming to protect the public in the EU from various disasters. We are living in rather unstable times, and threats arise not only because of irresponsible human activity and accidents but also intentional acts. This issue is particularly relevant in my country, Lithuania, which is surrounded by chemical and nuclear hazards. Firstly, at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, there remain chemical weapons from the Second World War, and secondly, there are plans to construct two nuclear power plants near the Lithuanian border. We must assess the situation, the security standards currently in force and their suitability as regards current needs. Only by assessing the existing situation can we determine whether we need new security standards. This assessment and standard-setting framework must be sufficiently flexible so that it can be adapted to changing technologies, which, as well as making our lives easier, can also become a deadly weapon when in the hands of terrorists. On the other hand, providing security should not become a reason or a pretext to centralise civil protection. Although the establishment and supervision of common security standards would help to provide security, we should not, in every case, create new institutions or unduly complicated procedures.</p>

I also believe that continued investment in infrastructure in many European regions, particularly in the south and east, is essential. Given the different levels of decentralisation of the European regions, a balance must be found when designing a horizontal approach between the different levels of government and between all areas of activity. Efforts towards the administrative modernisation and reform of the regions, combined with high quality technical assistance from the Commission, are essential prerequisites to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of EU investments. The simplification of procedures and the allocation of resources from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in a manner which is accessible to all interested parties is essential.

      <p sl="fr">To my mind, regional policy is one of the EU’s most important policies. The funds it distributes throughout Europe contribute to cohesion between the different regions and help them to become competitive. However, certain things can be improved, particularly in the area of multi-level governance; in other words, the coordinated action of the Union, of Member States and of regional and local entities. Regional policy suffers from the complexity of its procedures, which often deter local players from having recourse to it. Nevertheless, despite these procedures, the number of irregularities is still too high. I voted for this European Parliament initiative, which emphasises the crucial role that local authorities play in implementing regional policy while, at the same time, calling for multi-level governance to be improved. It also recommends better follow-up on the part of the Commission, with regard to both supporting regional players and making sure the funds are put to good use.</p>

I welcome the demand for simplification, because this is a precondition for a better understanding and use of European funds by local officials. Like the overwhelming majority of my fellow Members, I am in favour of a strong cohesion policy where financial resources are maintained after 2013, while rejecting any attempts at renationalisation. I would add, on a personal level, that the best way to prevent cohesion policy from being renationalised is to ‘Europeanise’ it. I find it regrettable that all too often, cohesion policy resources are used for projects with a regional or sometimes national dimension, but rarely with a European one.</p>

      <p sl="lt">European Union cohesion policy is the principle means of ensuring sustainable regional development. Implementation of cohesion policy is predominantly decentralised and based on sub-national authorities assuming responsibility. The Treaty of Lisbon has allowed territorial authorities to be more deeply involved in the decision-making process, to facilitate better and more effective implementation of cohesion policy measures, adapted to the needs of individual regions and their populations. I voted in favour of this report.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because in cohesion policy, decision-making processes are improved through the application of multi-level governance and the involvement of sub-national authorities. Supervision by the Commission, as currently foreseen, is considered insufficient and cannot compensate for ineffective control systems at national level persisting throughout the whole multiannual period. Therefore, in order to improve the control system and increase assistance to sub-national authorities, it is necessary for the Commission to strengthen its supervisory role and procedures. Higher investments, both in financial assistance and training, should be ensured for national and regional administrations to increase the capacities and knowledge of rules by authorities in charge of programme management. It should also be noted that the current funding application procedures that are too complicated are likely to discourage potential beneficiaries of cohesion policy.

For this reason, the capacity of regional and local authorities to implement EU policy has been strengthened. I agree with the adoption of this resolution, since it focuses on the specific nature of local and regional challenges, calling attention to the need to consider integrated approaches which emphasise the regions’ specific characteristics, such as their geographical and natural disadvantages, depopulation and the specific characteristics of the outermost regions, but which also recognises the different administrative processes existing in the various Member States. These approaches must also allow the coordination of the interests of the various actors involved in order to facilitate governance at several levels. The resolution also points to the fact that application procedures are too complicated and have an excessive number of checks which discourages potential beneficiaries of cohesion policy, as well as to the requirement to consult the general public in order to legitimise the decision-making process. I also agree that a stronger role for the regional and local level must correspond to a strengthened supervisory role for the Commission, and to increased coordination between cohesion and structural policies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Cohesion Fund accounts for more than one third of the total EU budget. Its ultimate aim is to reduce disparities between levels of economic development in the various regions, targeting resources specifically towards growth and employment. However, the Financial Times newspaper recently published an investigation over how Cohesion Fund resources are, in fact, spent and the scenario described is very worrying: the fund is used for purposes which are categorically not those intended.

      <p sl="pt">We agree with the need to guarantee respect for criteria relating to effectiveness, efficiency, rigour and transparency ‘in all the phases of Structural Fund programming and implementation’. We recognise that the ‘ongoing simplification of the Financial Regulation and of the Structural Funds rules’ could be essential in terms of lifting certain existing barriers to accessing them, particularly by less developed regions. Regarding the principle of cofinancing, whilst we recognise the importance of the assumption of responsibilities by national authorities when applying cohesion policy, we consider that, in view of the current profound crisis, something which has particularly affected certain Member States and their regions, the rules relating to cofinancing should be made more flexible. This will allow a better absorption of the funds set aside for cohesion policy. In particular, the maximum rate of cofinancing should be lowered to 10% for all Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We still disagree with and oppose some aspects of the report. One example is the ‘good governance’ advocated for public services which, according to the rapporteur, can only be achieved through a partnership of ‘public and private parties’. Another example is the patchwork of uncritical references to the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy: a strategy driven by liberalisation, privatisation and increased labour market flexibility which is an approach entirely at odds with the objectives of cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I approved of this report because the 2006 report of the European Court of Auditors showed that the control systems in place for the cohesion policy were not effective enough, and the error rate in the expenditure reimbursed was too great (12%). The 2008 report confirmed this data with 11% of funds unduly reimbursed. Overly complex rules governing the Structural Funds are partly responsible for these errors. The shared management system characterising the cohesion policy implies a high degree of complexity in the interpretation and application of the rules given the numerous actors involved. Therefore, rules should be simplified to ensure more user-friendly procedures and not discourage potential beneficiaries from participating in projects.</p>

The incorporation by the Reform Treaty of sub-national subsidiarity into the Community law for the policies of shared competence allows today territorial authorities to be more deeply involved in the decision-making process, both for the design and the implementation of policies, as fully dignified partners, to participate in achieving the Community objectives.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this European Parliament report because, with the increase in migration flows, it is important to create liaison officer networks. Given that the current economic, financial and social crisis has encouraged even more people to migrate, the European Union must do all it can to ensure that immigration flows are properly managed. The creation of networks would not only help to regulate legal, irregular and illegal immigration, but would also facilitate operational cooperation between the Member States and expedite the system for the presentation of the half-yearly reports. Furthermore, closer cooperation between officers would guarantee a better exchange of technical knowledge and liaison with colleagues working in third countries. I would like to underline that the European Union institutions should constantly strive to ensure a safe and swift immigration process and guarantee that EU citizens are protected from the possible dangers posed by irregular and illegal immigration. This can only be achieved by using all possible effective instruments of international and internal cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I believe that Parliament’s position on amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network contributes to the appropriate management of legal as well as illegal or clandestine flows of migrants. In fact, it is necessary to strengthen the synergies and operational cooperation between the Member States and third countries, in particular, through the liaison officers. I also believe that it is fundamental to analyse the activities of the immigration liaison officer networks in regions and/or countries of special interest to the European Union, particularly where the circumstances of these regions and/or countries have a bearing on illegal immigration or human rights issues. For its part, the Commission should develop recommendations on developing immigration liaison officer networks.</p>

Another point which is also just as important is that these liaison officers will be obliged to respect fundamental rights during their mission.

In the context of ‘mixed’ migratory flows, it is indeed crucial to include in their activities an approach that is more mindful and respectful of human rights. The assignments carried out by ILOs also need to reflect greater transparency and greater democratic supervision; this is now the case, with the exchange of information between the European Parliament, on the one hand, and organisations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), on the other, being strengthened. Given the Council’s opposition, the compromise finally found to solve the terminological controversy (‘illegal’ immigration versus ‘irregular’ immigration) seems satisfactory, but it can only be a first step. The European institutions will have to make good their commitment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The exchange of best practices between different countries’ police forces is sometimes necessary and its objectives commendable. We should remember, however, that international police cooperation existed way back in the 19th century, long before European integration. This report proposes, in the context of Frontex (European Agency at the External Borders of the Member States), an improvement in the exchange of information on illegal migratory flows, illegal immigration and the deportation of persons residing without authorisation, including the introduction of immigration liaison officers networks. One could welcome this new initiative, which the majority of Europeans want, were it really aimed at dramatically reducing immigration. However, the reality is altogether different, and this agency’s work, like the measures taken by the national governments, has resulted in failure. France and Europe are being swamped with immigrants. Around 900 000 people enter Europe illegally each year, according to an ‘official’ European Union figure. Given that illegal immigrants, and even foreign criminals, are not sent back to their country of origin, one is entitled to wonder how yet more provisions could reverse migratory flows without real political courage backed up by action.</p>

      <p sl="de">The border protection agency Frontex plays an important role when it comes to combating illegal immigration. This can only be effectively combated in the transit countries. A dense network of immigration liaison officers and their close cooperation is therefore a sensible measure to enable us effectively to combat mass immigration into Europe with all its negative consequences for the peoples of Europe. However, this will only be the case if the information and assessments provided by liaison officers are made available to Frontex and the national authorities as quickly as possible and without any red tape. As regards cooperation in particular, there is still potential for improvement and this needs to be exploited with regard to the issue of immigration. For example, the powers of Frontex should, with the consent of the Member States, be enhanced as quickly as possible in order to ensure that its work is uniform and effective, particularly at the external borders.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would be important to have a comprehensive strategy for how the external borders of the EU can be better protected and the causes of emigration from the countries of origin better combated.

Otherwise, he will be considered illegal and will be treated as an unwanted object, imprisoned for up to 18 months and thrown out. Nothing sets immigrants apart from local workers in the Member States of the EU. They are united by the common fate of the worker, the exploited, the producers of the wealth seized by capital. The fight for the fair demands of immigrants, for their legalisation, for the abolition of black-market and uninsured work, for higher salaries and wages, for an equal day’s pay for an equal day’s work, for full protection of social and civil rights and for the repeal of the Dublin agreement is a joint fight.</p>

You have to admit that there is something obscene about that. What is more, this text sought to guarantee certain economic and social rights to these immigrant workers, allegedly to avoid any social dumping or unfair competition with indigenous workers or workers who are already in Europe. This is an implicit admission that immigration pushes down European wages and does not make up for any labour shortages, but, on the contrary, results in direct competition for our workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some amendments, in wanting to promote equal rights – and equal costs – between residents and immigrants, were, in fact, tantamount to allowing every kind of immigrant, whether working or not, access to our social benefits. This represents a choice between social dumping and automatic handouts which is no longer bearable, neither politically nor financially. It is time to decide, at Member State level, to reverse migratory flows, which have become unbearable economic, social and even cultural burdens, and to practise national and Community preference in all areas.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The EU Member States face a constant struggle with the problem of illegal immigration and work carried out in what is known as the shadow economy by citizens of third countries. Appropriate steps must be taken to counteract these problems effectively. Simplifying and standardising procedures for issuing entry and residence permits for citizens of third countries in order for them to start working in a Member State will help limit illegal immigration. At the same time, it will make it possible for the workforce requirements of European markets to be met. The proposed regulations leave a certain margin of discretion to accepting countries, especially with regard to conditions for refusal of entry. This ensures an appropriate level of legal security and that there will be no interference in Member States’ competences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The directive under discussion will make it possible for all Member States to adopt a common position on economic immigration. This will ensure transparent regulations, security and legal protection for workers who suffer discrimination, a continued fight against illegal immigration and, finally, measures to combat unfair competition. For this reason, I agree with the rapporteur’s position.</p>

      <p sl="en">In 2001, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities. Despite a favourable opinion from the European Parliament, this ambitious proposal, which sought to establish the entry and residence conditions for third-country nationals wishing to undertake an economic activity within the Union, did not survive beyond its first reading within the Council, and the Commission officially withdrew it in 2006. I welcome the fact that the new legal basis provided by the Lisbon Treaty gives this proposal a good chance of being adopted.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report, together with my group, because I believe that it responds well to the considerable demographic challenges that the European Union will face in the coming years by establishing a single application procedure for third-country nationals who wish to be admitted to the territory of a Member State in order to work there, and by offering them a secure legal status.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, Parliament’s rejection will delay the analysis of this important directive, which would have simplified the often complex administrative procedures for receiving economic migrants. It would thus have enabled the labour markets of our Member States to respond to current and future manpower needs and would have provided a way of combating exploitation and discrimination, to which these workers too often fall victim. The directive seeks to reduce the differences that exist between national legislations: with this one-stop shop system, the administrative procedure would be simpler, less expensive and quicker.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our proposal would not have defined the conditions for admission for third-country nationals: the Member States would always have been responsible for determining the conditions for admission and setting the number of migrants to allow into their territory for employment purposes.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This document, which has been rejected by the majority of Members, was a piece of legislation which would have enabled flows of migrants to be better managed. It aimed to eliminate the differences between Member States in their labour and residency procedures, and give third-country nationals working legally in the EU access to certain rights. It was thus a step forward, for two reasons. Firstly, because we are creating a new instrument which aims to benefit third-country nationals wishing to immigrate to the territory of Member States by conferring upon them a set of rights. Secondly, because of the political message which it sends overseas, disproving the idea that Europe is closed and only able to pass repressive measures, and strengthening security at a time when we are responding to the concerns expressed in the Stockholm Programme regarding the creation of flexible immigration policies in order to support the EU’s economic development.

      <p sl="de">The circumstances under which third-country nationals are permitted to reside and work in an EU Member State are a matter for the state in question, not the EU. The fact that, in certain areas, periodic immigration of well-educated skilled workers may perhaps be useful must not result in an open door policy because, first and foremost, it should be workers from our own population, in other words, EU citizens, who are recruited. If we have a shortage of workers in many areas, we should investigate the causes of this and respond by adapting the training accordingly, but also by providing opportunities for reskilling. The fact that labour migration can be a problem for workers because it suppresses wage levels and can also lead to dumping prices has been shown time and again in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was for this reason, for example, that the transitional periods for the free movement of workers were introduced at the insistence of the countries with well-developed social security safety nets.

We need such a set of rules for at least two reasons. Firstly, although we should provide a preferential scheme for EU workers, legally resident workers participate in Member States’ economic life and are entitled to protection and guarantees. They should be considered as an asset to the EU economy and not as a threat to EU workers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, such clear rules would help achieve better control over migration.

We have been working on a European directive since 2001 without seeing any results. Now let us hope that the Council approves it in codecision with Parliament and that a conclusion is reached, given the importance of the issue. This is a crucial point for the development of Europe, as increasing demand for manpower is taking us ever closer to what is called ‘economic immigration’ and, therefore, a common regulation on the issue is urgently needed. Long-term economic development of the Union must be supported, so we need to simplify administrative practices regarding permits for third-country nationals who wish to be admitted to the territory of a Member State in order to work there, offering them a secure legal status.

The best way to combat illegal immigration and clandestine working is to develop a balanced policy towards legal migration, hosting immigrants on the basis of the needs of the labour market in the host state.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At a time without economic growth, it is important not to create false expectations of inclusion, or encourage policies which promote a scarcity of labour.

      <p sl="sv">Legal immigration into EU Member States is important for economic development. The immigration of workers can increase competition and vitality and, in light of the demographic challenges that the EU is facing with an ageing population, it is important to adopt a flexible immigration policy. We therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal, which seeks to introduce a single application procedure for third-country nationals applying for work and residence permits. This should simplify the complex administrative formalities involved in the reception of migrants. It should also make it possible for the labour markets in our Member States to react to current and future labour requirements and provide a tool for combating the exploitation of, and discrimination against, these workers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, we are opposed to the amendments tabled concerning additional documents, which would make the proposal contradictory and pointless. Having a single application procedure and one document becomes meaningless if all of the Member States can issue and demand additional documents. The amendment stating that the Member States may issue a document to supplement the residence permit, which may be updated or withdrawn when the person’s labour market situation changes, was voted through. As we were dissatisfied with the text and would have preferred the proposal to go to a second reading before it was adopted, we voted for the inclusion of correlation tables, against the wishes of the Council. These were not voted through, either, and when we found ourselves in a situation where a positive vote for the report would mean adoption at first reading with a content that we believed undermined the whole proposal for a single document instead of several within the EU, we chose to vote against the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="ro">One of the best ways of combating illegal immigration and undeclared work is to develop balanced legal immigration channels which meet the needs of the labour markets in our countries. Economic immigration is a reality on which we must impose order, but it is also a necessity in view of the demographic and economic challenges which the European Union will face in the near future. Immigration policy must be devised as an instrument for regulating our labour needs, thereby helping to implement the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

Today’s vote paves the way for new negotiations and says ‘no’ to allocating rights according to workers’ market value.

On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, this hierarchical arrangement is totally unacceptable: the Union must at last incorporate the conclusions of the many studies which show that the benefits – both individual and collective, economic and societal – for host countries and countries of origin alike go hand in hand with the full and effective exercise of migrants’ rights. The Greens will continue to pay extremely close attention to this matter in order to help equip the Union with an ambitious migration policy that is based on the principle of universality and indivisibility of fundamental rights.

      <p sl="pt">The objective of the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order is crime prevention. It is based on the fact that, although the Member States provide protection for the victims of crime when within national borders, it has become necessary to develop a European-level mechanism for early warning and prevention. This takes into consideration the recommendations made by the Stockholm Programme and the procedures resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which allow reports to be provided for on a cross-cutting basis, as well as the first Council proposal for a European victim protection directive of 5 January 2010. I agree with a wide-ranging approach in order to include the victims of several types of crime, and with the amendments that provide for arrangements for revoking the protection order, for ensuring continuity of legal protection, for laying down a deadline for execution of an order and for clarifying the position as regards victims moving from one Member State to another.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This directive concerns the application of protection measures intended to assist victims of criminal acts whenever these endanger an individual’s life, or physical, psychological or sexual wellbeing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Protection measures exist in all EU Member States, but cease to take effect when someone crosses the country’s borders. The European Protection Order aims to ensure that the protection offered to an individual in one Member State will be maintained and continued in any other Member State to which the person relocates or has been relocated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the position which the European Parliament adopted today, with 610 votes in favour, 13 against and 56 abstentions. It is based on the compromise negotiated between Members of this House and representatives of the Belgian Presidency of the EU. However, the text has yet to be confirmed by a qualified majority of Member States in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although most of the protection measures are aimed at women who have been the victims of domestic violence, the new rules should apply to all victims: as the adopted report states, ‘this directive applies to protection measures which aim at protecting all victims and not only the victims of gender violence, taking into account the specificities of each type of crime concerned’.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Protection Order is the practical expression of the priority given by the Spanish Presidency to combating violence against women. Victims covered by measures stipulating the distance to be observed by their aggressors will be protected beyond national borders, thus allowing them to start a new life wherever they see fit. The European Protection Order issued will have the same legal force throughout the Union. The scope of the text has been extended to include the protection ‘of life, physical or psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty or sexual integrity’. This broad definition includes the notions of forced marriage, paedophilia, human trafficking, genital mutilation, and so on. This measure meets the primary objective of the area of freedom, security and justice, which is to build a protective Europe. I therefore voted for this text.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the European Protection Order. It is an excellent initiative which will ensure that measures for victims’ protection will extend from one Member State to another. At present, protection orders stop at our border, leaving the victim defenceless. The EPO marks a huge step forward in victim rights. It is a strong instrument which will provide a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States’ borders. Over 100 000 women in the EU are covered by protective measures. However, I am very concerned by the blocking minority at Council level of which Ireland is part. I hope that the huge acceptance of this report at Parliament level will encourage the blocking minority to re-think their stance. I do not accept their argument that the legal basis of the report is inaccurate. Both the Council and the Parliament’s legal service found that the legal basis was adequate and, as unanimously supported by JURI, the protection order does not establish obligations to modify national systems for adopting protection measures, as the Member State to which a victim travels is asked to provide protection in accordance with its national law.</p>

      <p sl="en">The proposal for a directive on the European Protection Order, submitted by 12 Member States, is an initiative aimed at preventing crime. Even when Member States have provided for protection orders for victims, the resulting enforcement measures stop at the border of the issuing State. Victims, however, may move from one Member State to another for many reasons, not least to escape crime. Because they move in this way, they are defenceless when judicial and law enforcement cooperation fails to protect them by implementing a rapid, effective Europe-wide early warning and prevention mechanism. Setting up a cooperation arrangement along these lines is the aim that has given rise to this initiative.

      <p sl="it">Thanks to the contribution of the Council, and especially of the two rapporteurs and of the amendments we tabled in committee, the draft directive on the European Protection Order offers excellent protection for victims without any national legislative restrictions. It should be seen as a symbol of regulatory progress in Europe, which is working step by step to ensure that rights and safeguards are the same in every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="it">As it has been presented, the European Protection Order makes protection for victims wishing to move freely within the European Union a more decisive and faster process. The difference between our legal systems, including their procedures, is clearly still a constraint. However, the scope as defined allows our countries to adapt quickly to the new order, thereby strengthening our Union and giving more protection to European citizens, particularly the most vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore strongly support this proposal, which would give hope to the many people whose freedom and dignity is infringed on a daily basis, and who do not have all the means to react. In the future, they might even be able to start a new life in another country.</p>

Moreover, we can welcome the fact that a protection order can also be requested for the family of a protected person. Protection should not, however, be limited to the victim’s physical protection. His or her dignity as a human being must also be considered. I am well aware of the complexity of the initiative and of the challenges it may face, not least because of the potential differences between the Member States’ judicial systems and criminal, civil and administrative procedures.

The basic criteria have been defined, all issues have been thoroughly worked through, and the rationale is clear. Now, people who have become the victims of crime will be ensured the protection of the courts in every European Union country if they move from one EU Member State to another. This will give the investigating authorities and the Public Prosecutor the opportunity to carry out their investigations effectively and the victims of crime will not keep important information from the investigation out of fear.

      <p sl="de">Even though some measures have been taken in recent years to protect victims, the people affected are often left in the lurch. Lawyers and judges learn a great deal in their training about the rights of defendants, but they hear nothing about the right way to deal with witnesses and victims who appear as witnesses. If the scheduling is tailored to the defendant only and absolutely no consideration is given to a victim who is bringing a civil action against someone, that is like a slap in the face. Greater awareness is important here, but it is also needed in medical training, too, so that the use of domestic violence can be better recognised. The question of the statutory limitation of civil compensation claims is essential in the case of child abuse. The protection of victims also includes only allowing people with an unblemished criminal record to work with our children. If forced marriages are now being prosecuted in Liechtenstein, including without the consent of the victim, and it is possible to take legal action in the case of genital mutilation performed on a minor, this clearly shows the potential danger of the much lauded multicultural enrichment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since victim protection is still in its infancy and the people affected often do not know who they can turn to in their own country and what their rights are, it is important that victim protection is harmonised within the EU. I have voted in favour of the report.</p>

The draft directive aims to strengthen the protection of victims of this type of crime within the EU, because protection measures are currently limited to domestic legislation within Member States. This resolution aims to fill a gap in legislation to ensure that victims of aggression are protected outside their own countries too, thereby guaranteeing that every Member State offers victims adequate protection. Member States will not be required to harmonise their national laws, but they may adapt them so that they are mutually recognised.</p>

The possibility of enlarging the scope of a legal protection order from one Member State (‘the issuing state’) to another Member State to which the protected person wishes to move (‘the executing state’) is a significant advance towards the creation in practice of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, and this is an ideal which I share.</p>

Protection measures exist within all EU Member States, but they become ineffective when victims cross borders. The European Protection Order should ensure that any protection granted to a person in one Member State will apply in all the other Member States to which he or she travels or has travelled. The European Protection Order may be issued at the request of persons under protection if they decide to move to another Member State, or if they simply wish to spend time there. The Member State that issued the protection measure will be responsible for issuing an EPO and sending it to the Member State to which the person intends to travel.

The directive is indispensable in order that victims of violence can feel comparatively safe throughout the European Union, regardless of where they are living.

The directive on the European Protection Order represents a key step towards a European directive on violence against women. A joint, comprehensive EU strategy needs to be drafted and implemented as quickly as possible, with the aim of fighting violence against women in all EU Member States. We urgently need European legislative standards to combat violence against women. This is the only way we can support women and oppose society’s acceptance of domestic violence and the impunity of those who commit this crime. I hope that the upcoming Polish Presidency will make a significant contribution to the drawing up and adoption of a draft directive on this matter.

      <p sl="it">There is nothing more inhuman than exploiting the lives of other living beings for profit, infringing every fundamental right. Trafficking in human beings is one of the basest activities in history; it is a widespread and highly complex phenomenon. I am pleased that Parliament has approved at first reading the proposal for a directive on trafficking in human beings. This is a significant step forward in combating the phenomenon, which is the main activity of a large number of international criminal organisations. The most important point is the recognition that organised crime is the main problem to tackle. The EU is finally making a real, explicit distinction between crime and organised crime, because the latter is a truly separate issue. There are many other positive elements such as a broader definition of exploitation, greater protection for victims and the rule stipulating that victims of trafficking shall not be charged for crimes they have been forced to commit as a result of violence or the threat of violence against them. As Amnesty International points out, often women who are victims of trafficking are arrested for prostitution, or are not guaranteed full access to justice.</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported this resolution as trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery, a serious crime and a severe violation of fundamental human rights. The Treaty of Lisbon has strengthened EU action in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, including in combating trafficking in human beings, and the European Parliament, in becoming colegislator, has a full role to play. I strongly support the EP proposal that penalties for traffickers need to be increased to the level of the 2009 proposal, the confiscation of assets should be applied, and assistance to victims and, in particular, to child victims, should be further developed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that the EP should clearly express the requirement for Member States to do more in order to discourage demand for the services of victims of human trafficking, through awareness-raising campaigns, education, training and so on, all of which should fully incorporate a gender perspective.

      <p sl="it">The continued existence of economic and cultural inequalities on a global level has resulted in the development of new forms of slavery, no longer necessarily linked to the realm of sexual exploitation, but also to that of economic exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="it">These situations may not match the historical view we have of slavery, but they are equally offensive. They deprive their victims of the values of freedom and equality on which modern society is based. Victims are priced, sold or bartered, and stripped of their dignity. Trafficking in human beings is an extremely profitable business for organised crime, and it now has a cross-border dimension.</p>
      <p sl="it">One year after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there have been many initiatives in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters. We now need to strengthen the work of the EU by providing incentives for anti-trafficking actions, collecting data in order to compile reliable statistics, and establishing closer cross-border cooperation, including the exchange of information and best practice, as well as closer collaboration with Eurojust and Europol.</p>

The imposition of harmonised criminal law in the Member States of the EU, with the unashamed stated objective of strengthening the Euro-unifying and state mechanisms of repression in order to consolidate the power of the monopolies, is yet another heavy blow to grassroots freedoms.

      <p sl="fr">Trafficking in human beings is an abomination that the European Union unfortunately cannot ignore. Whatever the motives, be it sexual exploitation or work, it is considered unacceptable by the Union’s authorities. That is why Europe has already, for some time, had a broad range of legislation to combat this phenomenon. This new directive, for which I voted, replaces the former framework decision, in accordance with the new powers in this regard. By bringing together the acquis communautaire in this area and concentrating it within a single text, this directive is destined to play a major role in the fight against human trafficking. It defines the principles on which the Member States’ legislation must be based, lays down the applicable penalties, establishes the responsibility of legal persons, protects victims against any prosecutions that their status may have brought about, introduces measures for assisting and protecting victims and contains some specific provisions for women and children.</p>

This crime is widespread across the world and may take many forms, relating to sexual exploitation, forced labour, the illegal trade in human organs, illegal adoptions, etc. We therefore urgently need to take active measures to support a strategy on fighting trafficking in human beings, in which significant attention would be paid to combating and preventing trafficking in human beings.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure effective systems of assistance and support for victims, providing for the right to compensation, necessary medical treatment and free legal and psychological assistance, with special attention being paid to children. The strategy on fighting trafficking in human beings should also include social dimensions and the dimensions of immigration, asylum and reintegration policies.

      <p sl="bg">I supported the report because human trafficking is a serious problem which we need to tackle, and the measures set out in the Treaty of Lisbon are not forceful enough to overcome criminality in this area. Human trafficking is a kind of slavery, and Europe must protect its women, its children, its citizens, against this threat using all available means. It is a grave offence and a huge infringement of fundamental human rights which forces people into dependence through threats, violence and humiliation, and should be subject to a minimum sentence of 10 years. In addition, in my opinion, we need to adopt a victim-based approach which incorporates the identification of all potential categories of victims and special measures aimed at protecting them, focusing, in particular, on children and other risk groups, as Edit Bauer mentioned in her report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today, the European Parliament adopted an historic and particularly important directive strengthening the fight against trafficking in human beings. This directive is a very important step towards combating the scale of this terrible crime, laying down more severe penalties and sanctions, and further enhancing prevention and victim protection. I voted for this report because there must be a stricter response to human traffickers and the terrible crimes they commit, and harsher penalties and sanctions must be adopted so that their levels reflect the gravity of the offence committed and that they would act as an effective deterrent to such acts. The new directive contains a very important provision whereby, in addition to penalties, the Member States should include such sanctions as the seizure of property and take the necessary measures to seize and confiscate instrumentalities and proceeds from offences, as only then will these offences no longer be economically viable. I would like to draw attention to the fact that with the increase in the scale of these offences in Europe, the EU’s approach must be more oriented towards human rights, with most attention being paid to preventive actions, victim protection, return and reintegration policy and social issues.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Creating an Anti-Trafficking Coordinator position at European Union level would enhance the coherence of the actions taken in the battle against this modern-day slavery. Cooperation between states on this issue, especially at EU level, is good. However, on many occasions, they lose sight of the action involved in reintegrating into society those who have fallen victim to human trafficking. Education and prevention campaigns must obviously be focused in the less developed states in the European Union where broad sections of the population are vulnerable due to material shortages.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to have a better and more precise picture of this phenomenon, harmonised data must be collected which should include information on the number of people trafficked, including data on gender, age, the nationality of the victims, as well as the form of trafficking, the types of services for which the victims were used, the number of traffickers arrested, prosecuted and convicted and the mechanisms for referring these cases to the national asylum authorities. The extent of human trafficking is huge at the moment, but we do not know the real scale of this phenomenon due to a lack of precise, centralised EU data.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to congratulate Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh on tackling the difficult task of preparing a report on such a topical issue. Trafficking in human beings is one of the greatest evils of our times, on a par with slavery; it reduces its victims to a state of exploitation and dependency by ruthless criminal organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon of vast proportions; we do not know exactly how vast due to a lack of information. We therefore need to carry out specific studies to discover its true extent. At the same time, Europe needs to promote policies allowing for greater cooperation in the criminal and judicial fields. These can be implemented under Article 79 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which identifies the legal basis within the framework of the common immigration policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, I agree with the rapporteur’s request, namely: to increase penalties for traffickers in human beings and confiscate their assets; to make it a criminal offence for anyone to knowingly use the services of trafficking victims; and to provide greater assistance for victims.</p>

      <p sl="en">UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution.</p>

The EU’s response to this now covers prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation, the exploitation of workers through forced labour and begging, organ trafficking, illegal adoption, forced marriage, drug trafficking and even the exploitation of an individual to commit petty theft or robberies. In my view, the document strengthens crime prevention, particularly by creating legal offences, or by using penalties, the confiscation of goods, or the permanent closure of establishments used for criminal purposes, in the case of human trafficking.

It has been possible to reach a balanced compromise, creating an instrument capable of dealing more effectively with this type of criminal activity, and creating more rigorous policies and making penalties more severe, including prison terms of five to 10 years and the seizure of the proceeds of crime. At the same time, it strengthens the areas of prevention and victim protection, paying particular attention to children and other vulnerable groups.</p>

Hence, the European Union has finally equipped itself with an instrument for creating an environment that deters traffickers, and for making sure that trafficking victims are given assistance and protection.

      <p sl="de">Officially, slavery no longer exists. Unofficially, however, it is very much in existence in the form of human trafficking. This form of crime in particular has, for many people, become a lucrative business with billions being made in profits. When it comes to combating human trafficking, we are lagging far behind organised crime. Only a combination of different measures can ultimately achieve the goal. On the one hand, the security apparatus, which, in recent years, has been starved of funds, must be topped up again. Within the EU, only the spin-offs of human trafficking can really be combated, but we need to remove what underpins this. Subsidiary areas, such as begging, would be relatively easy to combat by imposing a general ban on begging throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, cooperation with the countries of origin, for example, for forced labour and forced prostitution, is essential.

According to Europol, there are hundreds of thousands of victims in the EU alone. Therefore, the stepping up by the EU of the fight against human trafficking is to be welcomed. A particularly positive aspect is the fact that organised begging is also being addressed for the first time. Left-wing romantics often shut their eyes and would have the public believe that these people are begging voluntarily and that there is no such thing as begging tourism or the begging mafia. However, some of the proposed measures go too far. Instead of placing the countries of origin under obligation with regard to the destruction of mafia structures and providing victims with local help and the opportunity for training and, therefore, a future in their own country, the EU is moving in the direction of residence permits and exemption from punishment for victims of human trafficking. This is sending the wrong signal: these people are already being lured to Europe with false promises. Residence permits in the context of victim protection and exemption from punishment if someone is caught stealing will be all the more of an incentive for someone to place themselves in the hands of the mafia.

Human trafficking involves strategic risks affecting stability and socio-economic development leading to: destabilisation of the labour market; the growth and diversification of organised crime; economic destabilisation resulting from the scale of money laundering; demographic destabilisation; a rise in public sector corruption; and destabilisation of internal economic investment. In Romania, approximately 780 victims were registered in 2009. At least 416 of these were victims of forced labour and at least 320 were victims of forced prostitution. The victims identified last year also included 176 children trafficked for forced labour and prostitution. Member States must provide funds for assisting and protecting victims, including for the provision of compensation to victims and the cross-border enforcement of EU anti-trafficking law. In the case of child victims, primary consideration must be given to the interests of the child and harsher penalties must be imposed on traffickers.

      <p sl="it">I congratulate Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh on their excellent work: the text adopted today will make the sanctions against traffickers tougher; it will provide greater protection for victims and will strengthen prevention.</p>
      <p sl="it">Prostitution, exploitation of children, forced labour: it is calculated that, each year in Europe, hundreds of thousands of people are sold as though they were objects. The EU considers that the main victims of trafficking are women and children, exploited for the purposes of prostitution (43%) or of forced labour (32%). There are many other reasons, besides prostitution and forced labour, for the exploitation of human beings: forced begging, illegal adoptions, organ trafficking, and so on are all cases covered by the text of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Under the new rules, victims will have to be given assistance and, in particular: appropriate accommodation and material assistance, necessary medical treatment, including psychological assistance, counselling and information, and translation services where appropriate. Legal representation must be provided free of charge, at least when the victim does not have sufficient financial resources. Victims of human trafficking should also have access to witness protection programmes, if deemed necessary by the national authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">This legislation represents an important step forward in combating this inhumane and degrading crime, and we welcome its adoption today. However, the aim of the directive was to address prevention, prosecution and protection, and the Greens regret that the provisions on victim protection are not as strong as we believe is possible and necessary. The position of victims and their legal status or their rights to legal assistance could, and should, have been much stronger. Hopefully, the Commission will now come forward with a proposal to revise the directive on residence permits for victims of trafficking so that we get a truly holistic approach to tackling this hideous crime, as envisaged from the beginning. I am also glad that there is no direct reference requiring Member States to take legal measures to penalise those who use services (for example, dining in a restaurant in which victims of trafficking are working). Besides the intricacy and legal uncertainty of differentiating the ‘what, who and when’ in all of this, such measures actually risk bringing victims of trafficking further outside the reach of the authorities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We have just adopted by an overwhelming majority the report on the proposal for a directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims. This is an historic vote for several reasons. In the first instance, it is the first time in the European Union’s history that binding European legislation has been adopted to combat human trafficking. In the second instance, the European Parliament and the Council reached an agreement at first reading, which means that the provisions of this directive will be implemented as quickly as possible. Lastly, this directive introduces heavier penalties for traffickers (five years minimum) and strengthens protection and assistance for victims. The new rules will apply to trafficking into the sex industry and to labour exploitation in sectors such as construction, agriculture and domestic service. I am therefore delighted with the result of this historic vote.</p>

This agreement with Georgia is aimed at shortening the visa application process, simplifying the paperwork required, and even exempting some categories of individuals, such as students, journalists and retired persons, from the requirement to obtain a visa. We voted at the same time on the agreement on readmission, in which the EU and Georgia have mutually undertaken to readmit their own respective nationals residing without authorisation.

Furthermore, reducing the bureaucracy and controls with regard to a neighbouring country can only improve relations with that country, creating the conditions for greater control of the area and, hence, for more security, development and stability.

The obligation to readmit its own nationals includes former nationals who have given up their nationality, who have lost their nationality or who have had their nationality taken away, without having acquired the nationality of another state. The obligation to readmit nationals also covers family members – spouses and minors or unmarried children – who do not have the right of residency in the requesting state, irrespective of their nationality.

The whole premise of the report is wrong, because it considers, without further analysis, that competitiveness and cohesion are not contradictory and incompatible concepts. In fact, competitiveness, as it operates today, including at European level, means lower wages and cuts to the workers’ rights and increasing privatisation for the benefit of big business; at the same time, it is out of kilter with the concept of economic and political cohesion. The report describes the problems faced by the regions in the EU, but is unable to propose convincing and viable solutions, remaining faithful instead to the Lisbon and EU 2020 strategies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon establishes as one of its founding values the promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the EU, and solidarity between Member States (Article 3 of the Treaty of Rome).</p>
      <p sl="pt">The main objective of cohesion policy is to promote balanced development between the 271 different regions of the EU, through the reduction of disparities between these regions’ levels of development. Special attention is paid to the less favoured regions, such as rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, areas with severe and permanent natural and demographic limitations, and island, cross-border and mountain regions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to this, I have been arguing for the need to align cohesion policy with the strategic objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and to encourage transparency in the allocation of funding. In my opinion, all information relating to the adoption and implementation of cohesion policy funding plans should be made available in real time on a website accessible to the general public, divided up by the most detailed NUTS classification possible: for example, implementation by NUTS level 3 should be presented wherever this designation exists. That is what I advocate in my opinion annexed to the Cohesion policy: Strategic Report 2010 on the implementation of the programmes for 2007-2013.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The reality experienced today in the European Union is the strongest and most straightforward rebuttal of the assertion made in the report, that cohesion policy has responded effectively to the socio-economic difficulties caused by the crisis. Another idea runs through the report: the association of cohesion policy with the so-called ‘Europe 2020 strategy’. It is well known that the Europe 2020 strategy, heir to the old Lisbon Strategy, follows the same political line of liberalisation, privatisations and flexibilisation of the labour laws. These guidelines, which have to be followed, do not contribute to cohesion: on the contrary, they accentuate disparities between countries and regions, and within each country. The redistributive function of the EU budget – essential for putting the principle of cohesion into practice – is seriously compromised by the smallness of its role.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To this must be added the costs, to the most vulnerable economies within the EU, of entry into the single market, of Economic and Monetary Union and of the deregulation of international trade, aspects ignored by the report. The recovery of production in each country and region, the sustainable use of resources and the conservation of the environment constitute strategic channels for the economic development of each country, together with the creation of jobs with rights, and the strengthening of the network of public services and the social functions of the state.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I agreed with this report because, in accordance with the spirit of the treaties, a cohesion policy which aims at reducing disparities in levels of development and prepares the regions to meet long-term and short-term challenges (globalisation, demographic change, the depopulation of rural areas, climate change and biodiversity protection), by taking into account their specific strengths and weaknesses, has proved to be essential in the process of European integration. A strong and well-financed cohesion policy is a precondition for delivering the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy. All regions should develop harmoniously. I am pleased that there are calls for the Commission to examine and propose working methodologies that promote urban-rural partnerships, combat the depopulation of rural areas and, at the same time, stimulate sustainable urban development, since nearly 80% of the EU population lives in urban areas. Urban and rural areas play a dynamic role in regional economic development. In the next programming period, there is a need for investment in urban as well as sub-urban projects and for better coordination with rural development programmes. There is a need to promote entrepreneurship and support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), recognising the key role they have played in fostering economic competitiveness and creating jobs, and we must facilitate access to funding, especially for SMEs, and ensure simplified access to risk capital and micro-finance. The Commission shall continue to simplify the procedures for utilising both the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in order to reduce the administrative burden on funding beneficiaries.</p>

      <p sl="el">This particular own-initiative report, which I voted in favour of, follows on from a long hard debate on what is a very sensitive topic for Greece. It is true that progress to date in political cohesion has helped to reduce the equality divide between the regions. However, the economic times have changed and cohesion policy needs to adapt to them. As the most important Community instrument of solidarity between the poorest and richest areas of the EU, the new role of cohesion policy should be to step up efforts to prevent the creation of nouveau pauvres economic islands or regions within the European structure. We therefore face a clear and specific challenge.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are two points to which Greece will need to pay particular attention: 1. The cohesion policy Objective 1 regions; this point has to do with convergence in terms of gross national product, which needs serious strengthening. 2. Regions which are being phased out (which include Attica); these will need to be examined case-by-case on the basis of their most recent economic data, as the economic crisis may have reversed the data for previous years.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The report highlights the achievements of the cohesion policy, which is essential to the successful implementation of the EU 2020 strategy as an instrument for eliminating the disparities between regions. Approximately EUR 86 billion has been allocated to research and innovation for the 2007-2013 period. In the future programming period, it is necessary to promote and apply successful models in the ‘knowledge triangle’ to ensure the sustainable development of regional strategic framework programmes for research and innovation</p>
      <p sl="ro">The rapporteur calls on the European Commission to submit concrete proposals for defining and implementing consistently the objective of territorial cohesion, emphasising the importance of the principle of decentralisation down to local authority level (the ‘bottom-up’ approach), with a view to improving the level of absorption of funds (it is counterproductive that regions administer, on average, only 30.5% of the overall budget allocated to the cohesion policy, with the remainder being administered by central governments).</p>
      <p sl="ro">Consequently, in future, the partnership principle must be significantly strengthened.

      <p sl="pl">In recent years, money from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has contributed to the dynamic development of many towns and a significant proportion of rural areas. Cohesion policy is tangible evidence for EU citizens of the positive impact of actions taken at EU level on local communities and their regions. We are slowly exiting the crisis which has given rise to additional inequalities within the EU. Cohesion policy has turned out to be a flexible instrument which has managed to respond to the specific needs of individual regions and, to a certain extent, cushion the negative effects of the crisis. Cohesion between regions is a unique kind of added value which has a positive impact on the EU’s economic competitiveness. By bringing the level of development of the regions closer together and ensuring a similar quality of life and equal access to infrastructure, the EU can face up to global challenges. It will be able to concentrate more on investments in innovation, research and development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A sustainable, green, knowledge-based economy will mean we are more competitive, since competitiveness will increase if unemployment falls in the regions and if we support the creation of a well qualified and mobile workforce, both in urban and rural areas. Support for small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ the majority of the EU’s citizens, is a key issue. We need a strong cohesion policy, which, in turn, requires an appropriate budget, at least at its current level, in order to meet its ambitious targets.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Economic, social and territorial cohesion is a necessary condition of competitiveness at global level, but is not sufficient to ensure it. European cohesion policy aims to reduce regional disparities, taking into account the impact of global challenges, such as climate change, demographic change, problems relating to energy and the protection of biodiversity, as well as the new challenges resulting from the economic and financial crisis. I therefore support the text put forward by the rapporteur, my colleague in the Committee on Regional Development, which reiterates the idea that cohesion and competitiveness are not contradictory or incompatible, but possess complementary elements.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Competitiveness within the European Union may only be achieved through sustainable economic growth, which will see cohesion policy contributing to the successful implementation of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and to responses to societal and economic challenges. The regional dimension should therefore not be forgotten, but rather encouraged, whether through greater participation by regional and local entities, or through an increase in the role of urban and rural areas, as it is only through the stimulation of regional competitiveness that we will have solid competitiveness at global level.</p>

If need be, they can be improved and adapted much more quickly than any alternatives, interesting as they may be. At present, I think we must ask ourselves a simple question: is the crisis best addressed with instruments that are consensual, or by opening yet another discussion on which there is no consensus? As your question suggests, there is indeed no consensus on the proposals made recently by Prime Minister Juncker.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the answer today is obvious. We should concentrate on what can build consensus in the euro area, because not having this consensus will be detrimental for the markets’ perception of the euro area. Let us not kill the very interesting idea of Eurobonds for the future, but let us concentrate, at this stage, on what we can do quickly and decisively.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have answered my questions with your inimitable diplomacy, but I do not want to let you get away with this. I will therefore ask you very specifically: in his role as President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker has announced that he intends to take the initiative in the European Council with regard to the introduction of Eurobonds. Will you support him in this? Furthermore, are you likely to try to convince Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to join the majority of the euro states, or, when Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy say ‘we do not want that’, will you say ‘okay, because two parties say ‘no’, we will dispense with the idea’?</p>

      <p sl="en">I am going to give a very candid answer. I do not believe at this stage that there is the slightest possibility of getting an agreement on Eurobonds.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is reluctance on the part of several Member States regarding that proposal. That is why I think we should work to reach the largest possible consensus with the current instruments. I have said to you very frankly – and particularly to Martin Schulz – that I found the idea interesting and attractive. In fact, the Commission has made several proposals before – in the time of one of my illustrious predecessors – but at this stage, the conditions are not right for getting an agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">I have a specific question but I want to say, Mr Barroso, that you have the right of initiative with the Commission. You can come forward with a proposal on Eurobonds, and that was what Mr Schulz was asking. OK, so you do not use that right, and that is a problem for the moment on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have a specific question on the 2009 discharge. There is a declaration of assurance by a Director-General of Regional Policy, who says, and I quote him, that for 38 out of 79 programmes, the Directorate-General does not have reasonable assurance on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions in relation to reimbursements in 2009 of expenditures declared. This prompts the question as to who is in a position to provide this reasonable assurance. The declaration continues that, for the 41 remaining programmes, significant deficiencies have been identified at an early stage, before any reimbursement in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="de">So my question to you is, assuming that you take political responsibility for this declaration with all its ramifications, what will be your line of action towards the Member States?</p>

      <p sl="en">In answer to your comment, Mr Verhofstadt, let me tell you first of all that the Commission has already used its right of initiative. You will remember that, when we launched this mechanism, Olli Rehn and I introduced the possibility of collective guarantees, which was more or less going in the direction of Eurobonds. It was flatly rejected by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We could now put forward new proposals, but at this time, I do not think that it is responsible to put forward formal proposals again when we are in such a sensitive situation. It will only divide the euro area and the European Union. But the Commission has already made proposals. They were on the table and were rejected. That is the reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the financial perspectives, I have already made a commitment to putting forward the proposal for a specific kind of Eurobond – euro project Eurobonds – and, even though I have already heard some negative comments from some capitals, I am still hopeful that this will come into being.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding your question, I think we have to ask more of the Member States. As you know, with the exception of four or five Member States, they are not ready to give their declaration of assurance. It is true what our Director-General said – as you mentioned – that sometimes, the Commission does not have all the necessary instruments to engage with the Member States as early as possible with regard to the way in which European Union funding is spent at national level.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso, a year ago, you told me that GMOs had polluted your first term of office and that you wanted to refer the issue back to the Member States.</p>

A few days ago again, the Environment Council rejected Commissioner Dalli’s proposal by a very large majority. The opinions of both Council’s and Parliament’s legal advisers have also been negative.

In fact, the commissioner responsible met with the sponsors of this initiative even though it has not yet been formally approved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the present question, we will be continuing to apply the legislation in its current form. We do not have a better alternative to EFSA. This is an independent agency which was set up to provide opinions. The agency gathers expert information on this subject and, of course, we need to abide by the opinions it issues. We are therefore going to continue abiding by Community law on this subject. The Commission cannot decide to suspend the application of Community law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have already told you quite openly that I am not happy with the system governing GMOs in Europe. I am not happy with it because I do not think it is clear enough. However, this is the system that I am obliged to adhere to.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We cannot accept assessments today that were carried out on the basis of old rules. That is why I am asking you this question very precisely and I would like you to start this whole debate again from scratch, instead of waiting until 2012.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Gazprom and the Nord Stream consortium have been laying what is known as the Northern Pipeline since 9 April. I do not wish to focus on the environmental aspects of this project, since this House has also already debated them. I merely wish to draw your attention to one issue – the pipe which has been laid makes it significantly harder for large ships to reach the Polish port of Świnoujście. This port is a major source of work for many Poles in western Poland, a region affected by a level of unemployment which is often fairly high. Poland has raised this issue in bilateral talks, but I have the impression that we are also dealing here with problems relating to competitiveness. The port of Rostock is right next door, over the border in Germany. I hope it will enjoy rapid growth, but I would like all ports in Europe to be treated equally, so that they really can compete and so that the technical solutions adopted by one of the Member States do not obstruct the development of a port in another.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am aware that there have been concerns at some point that access to the Polish ports concerned would be restricted. According to the information available to the Commission, however, the German Stralsund mining authority included a requirement for the Nord Stream company in its permit to prepare a revised risk analysis for a section of the pipeline in German territory, as plans were presented at that stage by the Polish side to adapt both ports for ships that would need a deeper water depth to float. As a result of the analysis, the pipeline will be laid in the seabed with a covering of half a metre for about 20 km.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the analysis of the planned route of the German EEZ led to the decision to opt for an alternative track over a length of 12 km. The final permission was granted by the Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography in February this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the information available from the German authorities and the developer, both of the above measures were taken in order to ensure unrestricted access to the Polish ports after construction of the pipeline.

      <p sl="en">Secondly, regarding referenda, constitutional and democratic theory allows for referenda as well as for representative democracy. By the way, Britain is probably the country that has done most for representative democracy. A perfectly legitimate way of making decisions in a democracy is by representative democracy.

      <p sl="en">China enjoys a large surplus on its balance of trade with the EU. Europe’s surplus in services is too small to compensate for this.

      <p sl="en">It is very important that in digital space, we have freedom, but this must, of course, be responsible freedom, with important rights like the right to privacy being protected. Data protection is therefore also a question of fundamental rights and we believe the Commission has put forward sensible proposals that strike the right balance between freedom – that is non-negotiable – and using the Internet in a responsible manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">President, you answered questions on the issuance of Eurobonds to provide current spending for governments. I understand and I share some of the concerns expressed about such a course of action. However, do you not recognise the capacity for borrowing which exists as a result of the sound management of the euro?</p>
      <p sl="en">Since Mr Oettinger tells us he needs EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years for energy infrastructure investment – that is about EUR 100 billion a year to help tackle the twin challenge of climate change and energy security – and since that would be extremely ambitious for the European Investment Bank to take on, could you not bring forward proposals for the issuance of Eurobonds to finance investment in infrastructure rather than to finance current government spending?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Watson, I did not come here to ‘WikiLeak’ with you! You already know my position on this issue. In my State of the Union address to you, I mentioned that I will make proposals for Eurobonds, taking the shape of project bonds specifically for infrastructure. These would not be for Member States to have more debt or to cover excessive debt – because we have a problem with excessive debt in Europe – but specifically to fund some important infrastructure projects, mainly with the support of the European Investment Bank – as you correctly said.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is very much on the agenda and in our financial perspective. In June, we will make some concrete proposals on this issue. Let us try to build the necessary consensus, because I think that this is one of the ways to address our current problem. There are very important constraints on the budgets of our Member States and, at the same time, we need financing for some truly European projects.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr Barroso, what I am concerned about is the content. It seems to me that we are shooting the messenger rather than getting to the heart of the problem. The major issue that is behind WikiLeaks is its content, which they are demonstrating is true.</p>
      <p sl="es">For years, you and other colleagues of yours, such as Miguel Moratinos, have denied the majority of its content. You have denied that there was European collusion with certain illegal practices by the United States.</p>
      <p sl="es">We now know that this is true, that it did happen, and we are still waiting for an answer from many foreign ministries and, in particular, from you. I believe that it is essential that you give an explanation regarding the content.</p>
      <p sl="es">Following that, I have another question regarding the campaign against Julian Assange. I think it is really important that we take into account the risks that this person is currently facing. We cannot forget that he did something that was necessary, which was to bring the truth to the table.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is what I hope you will also understand, and it is what we all hope for in Parliament: for you to give explanations, either here or in a committee that we should reactivate in order to ascertain the real truth.</p>

The Member States need to provide all the clarifications, and I am confident that they will do so, like the democratic states that they are. I know that initiatives have been taken in some Member States to inform the public about specific operations of which they have been accused.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the work of the Commission, as the honourable Member, Mr Coelho, reminded us a short time ago, the Commission has done everything in its power to provide the maximum possible information to Parliament and to the European public. With regard to Julian Assange, I have no comment to make. There are accusations against him of a criminal nature, which were made by a Member State – Sweden – which is a democracy and currently has a European Arrest Warrant out against him, which is being examined by the British judicial authorities. The Commission clearly has nothing to say about this, apart from the obvious: any defendant is innocent until proven guilty.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, a real war is being waged in cyberspace at the moment. According to the press, over the last few days, thousands of hackers have launched cyber attacks on companies which have been trying to get WikiLeaks off the Internet or to undermine it financially and have its donations cut off.</p>
      <p sl="el">Companies such as MasterCard, Visa and PayPal have been hit by DDOS-type cyber attacks, with thousands of computers trying to connect to the same website at the same time, thereby overloading it and making it crash.</p>
      <p sl="el">We all realise that this causes problems for the public’s transactions in general. The question is straightforward: do we consider – at European level – that we have a reliable safety net to protect the public’s online transactions if this happens?</p>

Regarding the cyber attacks that you have mentioned, let me tell you that the United States State Department denies having issued any direct instructions to PayPal, Visa or MasterCard, so I do not have any comment to make on decisions by companies to service – or not to service – WikiLeaks. The Commission is against any kind of cyber attack made by one side or the other in that controversial case.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the publication of classified US diplomatic correspondence by WikiLeaks and by respected international media is only possible because of a colossal failure within the US security system, due to the excessive enlargement of the circles of distribution of the State Department and the Department of Defence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What consequences do you believe this failure could have for the transatlantic relationship, specifically at the level of sharing diplomatic and intelligence information? Also, what lessons are being learned to strengthen the security of inter-European communications networks and the functioning of the European External Action Service, including the Correspondence Européenne network and security against cyber attacks?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Firstly, we believe that what occurred in the United States could occur within practically any security system. No security system is completely immune to the possibility of a person breaking the law.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is true that within the US system, apparently, according to information received, hundreds of thousands of individuals have access to extremely confidential information, but the truth is that within systems that value freedom, which is also the case for European systems, 100% security is impossible. It is for this reason that we are determined to work with our partners and friends in the United States to strengthen security, but always with respect for fundamental freedoms too, and we believe that it is important to find a good balance between these two precautions, as I said a short while ago.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is true that, in particular, because of terrorist activity, there is a need to exchange some extremely sensitive pieces of information. At the same time, we should do this in line with standards of caution and, in general, while observing the principle of fair balance.</p>

      <p sl="it">As the statements by the government representatives of numerous States demonstrate, the extraordinary zeal with which Julian Assange is being investigated is clearly designed to punish him and WikiLeaks for having revealed certain top secrets to the world, such as the concerns of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who asked the US embassies in Rome and Moscow for information on any personal investments of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Putin that might influence the foreign or economic policies of their respective countries. Mr Berlusconi is described as Mr Putin’s spokesman in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Clearly, what is taking place here is the unprecedented punishment and persecution of a man and an organisation whose only crime is to have made the world aware of certain grey areas that put governments in an uncomfortable position. Hence, it is our duty to protect the freedom of WikiLeaks and to guarantee fair treatment for Julian Assange, who should pay for his crimes, if proven, in a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore call on the Commission to state its position on the WikiLeaks affair and to explain how it intends to monitor the situation so that this affair is not used to clamp down on freedom of information and to impose restrictions on the Internet, which has once again proved to be an exceptionally powerful democratic instrument, and which must therefore be protected.</p>

Both Sweden and the United Kingdom respect the rule of law. We have to let the normal process of law go on.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I think that we are still missing the point. At least, I think, from your answers, that you are missing the point. First of all, I am absolutely flabbergasted – and I would like to know if you are equally flabbergasted – at the unbelievable silence on the part of the European bodies about this suppression of freedom of speech. Unfortunately, the defenders of freedom of speech are all absent from the House. They have disappeared.</p>
      <p sl="el">My question is this: do you think this is being used to suppress the facility to transfer data? We all shout about the right of the Chinese and the Cubans to access the Internet – and rightly so; but what can and should we do now that this right is actually being suppressed?

      <p sl="en">First of all, the substantive issue that we have addressed is that freedom of expression, in all its forms, is not only a fundamental human right, but the cornerstone of all democratic societies. It is not negotiable.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, it is also clear that there is information, be it private, commercial or legal, which, by its very nature, is sensitive and cannot be accessible to the wider public. Data protection is also anchored in fundamental rights. All our Member States have rules that protect data and some kinds of sensitive information for the sake of the public, and this is our position in terms of freedom of expression and data protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding accusations against a specific person, I am not a tribunal.

      <p sl="en">I fully agree with the concern that you have expressed. This is exactly the line we are developing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not so long ago, the European Union witnessed cyber attacks against public and private organisations in Estonia and in Lithuania, in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Thousands of cyber attacks are committed daily against European Union institutions and other public authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission recently responded to this alarming situation by proposing, on 30 September, a proposal for a directive on attacks against information systems, repealing the relevant framework decision from 2005. The overall goal of the directive is to combat large-scale attacks originating from and/or targeting the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are very attentive to these concerns, and we believe that the proposal for a directive is a good one. It penalises the users of tools such as botnets for committing the offences, and introduces a higher level of sanctions for committing the offences. It introduces an obligation for Member States to respond to an urgent request from both the public and the private sector via the 24/7 network of contact points within eight hours of receiving the request, and introduces a monitoring obligation for Member States to facilitate the collection and provision of data about cyber attacks, including the number of prosecutions and criminal reports.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the responses concerning Mr Assange’s case and his imprisonment on account of his ideas of freedom are reminiscent of those of Pontius Pilate.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like us to consider three points:</p>
      <p sl="it">1. This is a case of fumus persecutionis , because the accusations are very weak; 2. the United States is putting pressure on a European country to extradite, even though it has not yet specified the legal grounds for this request; 3. a citizen’s European bank accounts have been closed, meaning that he cannot receive any financial assistance in Europe from his supporters.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is more, all the statistics confirm that the European public is in favour of these principles of freedom, that it wants Internet freedom, that it is in favour of freedom, despite the doubts and the problems that have emerged in the wake of this initiative, which I personally do not fully support.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, we would like President Barroso to state what the limits are and what the protection of human rights and of freedom of expression is really and truly founded on. Are we looking at a virtual Guantánamo here? Are we facing the threat of an Orwellian total censorship of the Internet? That is the danger, and we need answers on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also important to keep a check on Mr Assange’s prison conditions, because in Italy, not even Mafia members are held in complete isolation.</p>

      <p sl="en">I can give you some information on the legal aspects of this case, without prejudging the position, of course, because I am not a tribunal and cannot make a decision on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, Mr Assange was taken into custody by the British authorities on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant. The Swedish prosecutor issued an advertisement notice regarding Mr Assange in the Swedish system, the Schengen system and via Interpol, and that was the basis on which a European Arrest Warrant was issued.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, according to Article 28 of the framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant, a person who has been surrendered pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant shall not be extradited to a third state without the consent of the competent authority of the Member State which surrendered the person. This means that, since Mr Assange was taken into custody in the UK, the British authority competent to decide whether or not to surrender him to Sweden would also have to give its prior consent to extradite him to a third country.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the best explanation I can give of the legal aspects, but I cannot make any sort of presumption about the culpability or not of the individual in question.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, after many months of negotiations, discussions and tension, we will have finally managed – tomorrow I hope – to adopt the European Union 2011 budget here at the European Parliament plenary session. I would like to start positively with what I believe to be the most interesting and effective of the achievements of the 2011 budget, and those that are of particular significance for European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First and foremost, I am very pleased that we managed to reach an agreement on time, that the difficult negotiations with the Member States and the European Commission were completed before the end of 2010, and that we managed to avoid the hazard of a provisional 2011 budget, even though each of the parties, of course, had to compromise to a certain extent. I would like to draw your attention to several valuable and interesting aspects regarding the specific details of what we managed to negotiate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First and foremost, this relates to the joint position that we drew up, and the unanimous adoption of Parliament’s proposal of October 2010 regarding the European Parliament’s priorities in terms of budgetary obligations. All our proposals regarding increased funding for the budget lines which are vital for youth, education, mobility, innovation, research programmes and for programmes relating to key issues in international affairs were accepted by the Council and the Commission. I am pleased about this. It should also be noted that Parliament was very realistic and disciplined in its October reading. I am pleased that the Council and the Member States took note of this discipline and acknowledged the priorities we proposed, and to which we have been making clear reference since March.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In summary, I am pleased that this triangle – youth, education and mobility – was understood and properly appreciated by the Council. I hope that the Commission will make every effort to ensure that these increased funds are used appropriately in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased that we managed to understand our own fears to a large extent. However, our satisfaction that we managed to reach an understanding is, in very many respects, marred by several important elements. First and foremost, during the 2011 negotiations, we saw in practice how difficult it is to implement the Treaty of Lisbon, how many unknown areas remain ahead of us and how much joint work we have to put in to develop practical, pragmatic solutions arising from the new frameworks within which we are functioning. This process has by no means finished.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It has also become painfully clear that the Member States are showing an ever-decreasing amount of solidarity when they have to contend with a crisis, and it is precisely European solidarity that is the first value to be lost when savings have to be made in national budgets. I regret greatly that the Member States have suddenly become so very short-sighted and that they want to make savings specifically on European integration. It is a sore subject. We must return to this debate, as it is by no means over.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to ask Mr Wathelet two rather important questions on subjects that continue to puzzle me. I would like to know whether the Council intends to adopt the joint declaration – the draft of which we have seen, although I am unclear as to its status – on the Multiannual Financial Framework. Furthermore, the European Commission, in accordance with Parliament’s expectations, presented a whole series of single-page declarations clarifying Lisbonisation, European added value and own resources. I would like to ask Mr Wathelet, who represents the Council here, whether the Council could explain its own position on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Once again, I would like to thank my fellow Members from the European Parliament for their contribution and everyone from the European Commission and the Council for their constructive approach, and I will be grateful for an answer to these questions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for Parliament’s budget, I can definitely speak of a political success in respect of this part of the budget. Parliament’s position following the vote on the budget in October has been accepted almost in its entirety by the Council. My approach was to tackle this budget with a great deal of responsibility, with ambition commensurate with the Treaty of Lisbon, but also with self-restraint on our part, because, of course, we all understand the difficult situation we are in, but are nevertheless committed Europeans. This was precisely the conflict of aims that we had with Parliament’s budget, as well as with the general part of the budget. The different institutions, in other words, our own House, but also the other small institutions such as the European Data Protection Supervisor, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Auditors, have been given the posts that they desperately need – not as many as they originally asked for, but a number that recognises what they really need. Parliament’s budget – and I think this is important – has been cut by EUR 25 million compared to what the Bureau originally asked for. In other words, this is another clear sign of self-limitation and self-restraint, but not self-denial.</p>
      <p sl="de">Something else that was particularly important to me was for us to use more resources to make our buildings energy efficient. There should also be more bicycles here in Strasbourg so that we are not reliant on so many cars, and it should be possible to provide the staff of the institutions with cards for local public transport in Brussels. Thus, here, too, it is a question of environmental responsibility. The salaries adjustment in accordance with the court ruling has been properly budgeted for and will be financed by redistribution from other parts of the budget. That means that we have reached a good compromise between Parliament and the Council, and we have cooperated well.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I will now, if I may, give you my political assessment of the general budget as budget coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The increase in payments – 2.91% – is a very modest one, and it is a transitional budget at a time of necessary austerity in the Member States. Parliament, however – and I still believe this is an appropriate request – wanted a clear agreement with the Council on how the Treaty of Lisbon, which the Council and Parliament adopted together, of course – after all, we are not opponents on this issue – can actually be implemented. I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament is not going beyond the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are merely demanding observance of the Treaty. However, we are also calling for the Council not to hide behind the results of the Treaty of Lisbon. There is a danger of this in my opinion, and it is something regarding which any self-respecting parliament must express its criticism.</p>
      <p sl="de">We Greens are not satisfied with what we have achieved up to now. There are a few weak statements, but that is not what we originally wanted. I am of the opinion that if we adopt an ambitious strategy for which there are genuinely good grounds, then we must also stick with it and not give up ahead of time. As Greens, we are pleased that we do not currently have the money for the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, because we do not consider this to be a real priority at this point in time and, from an environmental point of view, we believe that we should spend more money on renewable energies and environmental restructuring, rather than putting it into projects whose success is not assured. However, what we can now undoubtedly see as regards the next year is that the negotiations will continue. I very much hope that, in a pro-European spirit between the Council and Parliament, we will then be more successful together.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now on the home straight for the adoption of the 2011 budget. This has not been a walk in the park. There have been a few pitfalls, but I hope that we are finally reaching our objective in this budgetary procedure and that, as the rapporteur said to you a moment ago, we will be able to approve a budget before the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that that is really what drove us all on today, and here we have the proof that when all the budgetary areas said that they really wanted to reach an agreement, they were telling the truth. However, we perhaps also need to say that we have carried out a new exercise and we have inaugurated a new procedure, and I think – as the rapporteur said just now – that everyone has had to make concessions, everyone has had to make some compromises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the one hand, the European Parliament has itself considerably amended the Council’s draft on commitment appropriations. It has managed to get several projects and preparatory actions included, it has initiated debates and questioned the funding for a large number of policies, and it has truly played its role as a budgetary authority in full. It has also accepted the restrictions that the Council imposed quite strictly, particularly with regard to payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, there is also the joint statement to which the rapporteur referred, and which the Council clearly endorses, given that it is a joint statement. You will also be aware that we have received a letter from the Prime Minister of Belgium, the current President of the Council, addressed to the President of the European Parliament, telling us that the representatives of the next four six-month Presidencies have confirmed that they wish to undertake the procedure for developing future financial perspectives in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. In a sense, then, this is the first implementation of the joint statement that we have adopted together regarding the development of future financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, the European Parliament has also put forward a list of requirements concerning its own ambitions in the procedures relating to own resources, and you yourselves have also had the opportunity to become familiar with the European Commission’s statement, which demonstrated that, through exercising its power of initiative, it will, in fact, move forward on this agenda and, in this way, it will implement the new budgetary procedure, as well as the coming financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning the 2011 budget itself, it is true that this is a strict budget, with an increase in payment appropriations of 2.9%. In spite of that, however, we have been able to make sure that the European External Action Service can see the light of day. We have also managed to finance the three new financial surveillance agencies as part of this tight funding increase of 2.91%. By mobilising the flexibility instruments, we have also been able to take into account the political priorities that Parliament wanted to implement, providing EUR 105 million for new preparatory actions, youth projects and mobility projects. As you have seen, Mrs Trüpel, when we talk about Parliament’s priorities, we use exactly the same words that you have been repeating time and again, both in the trialogues and in your last speech.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Conducting this new procedure in the context of the Lisbon provisions was a new experience for all of us and, as I humbly admit, for me above all. It is true, however, that this has allowed us to have a number of meetings and discussions – sometimes heated ones – but once again, we can say today that we have reached an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would say that I still have a sense that too little has been done, and I have a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, unfortunately, regarding the possibility of moving flexibility from unanimity to qualified majority. I think that our efforts really brought us close to an agreement, and my fear is that this possibility will not arise. I consider it a shame that we did not seize this opportunity, either on the issue of flexibility itself or on the financing of ITER.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This may not be a simple procedure, therefore, but if there is goodwill, and the will to succeed on both sides, we will get there. At this point, I would also like to thank all those who have genuinely helped to make sure that tomorrow, hopefully, we can confirm this agreement: President Buzek himself, who, I would say, really rolled up his sleeves during this budgetary procedure, but also Mr Lamassoure, the rapporteurs, Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel, and obviously Commissioner Lewandowski, who, in spite of the disagreements, came back each time with new proposals, making sure that this procedure finally reached a conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So here is the proof that we can reach agreements, and also the proof that this new Lisbon procedure can be a success. Despite the pitfalls and the difficulties that we faced, we succeeded in reaching an agreement and we have this budget, which is much more than just a budget: it will also provide concrete results for the citizens with regard to mobility, youth, the Structural Funds that will be able to be released for those European regions that really need them, the External Action Service and the financial agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, thanks to this budget, we will be able to implement policies in the service of European citizens. That is what must drive us on, and that is what has ensured that everyone has made the compromises necessary to reach an agreement.</p>

    <intervention id="2-472" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome, on behalf of the Commission, the fact that Parliament is willing to vote on the 2011 budget, even if not all the elements of the original package – comprising a Multiannual Financial Framework regulation, a new interinstitutional agreement and also financing of ITER – have been finalised.</p>
      <p sl="en">By voting, the two arms of the budgetary authority demonstrate a sense of responsibility in avoiding a budgetary crisis at a time when Europe is facing severe challenges and when we face financial instability in several Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to stress the importance of Parliament voting in the same way as was voted in the Council, namely, to avoid further conciliation. The Council has taken steps to include Parliament’s wishes in preparatory actions, pilots, reserves and budgetary remarks. I think this – to vote in the same way and avoid further delays in time – is a test of the will we have to deliver the budget, to deliver the means to European citizens to implement projects and the programmes that could and should be conducive to growth in jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of commitments, the level to be voted is EUR 141.8 billion, corresponding to 1.13% of GNI, with, I think, major priorities of Parliament taken on board relating to youth, small and medium-sized enterprises and research in headings 1a and 3b, and to Palestine in heading 4.</p>
      <p sl="en">To achieve these goals, we need to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to the value of EUR 105 million. The payments are set at the level of EUR 126.5 billion, corresponding to 1.01% of GNI. That is the understanding of the budgetary constraints that the Member States currently face.</p>
      <p sl="en">The level of payments is set under the condition – which is very important for the Commission – that they agree on a joint statement submitted to act swiftly if needed to provide additional payment appropriations through transfers or amending budgets, in order to avoid any shortfall in payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, in the case of reserves, probably to be voted, I have to reiterate the position of the Commission and we are, of course, striving to respond to the conditions set by Parliament as early as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very important to have a budget in place, so that we can carry on the discussions in the other areas without the additional complication of working under provisional twelfths. This is really very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">What remains is the financing of ITER, and what is connected with the financing of ITER is the international credibility of a united Europe as a partner for global scientific and technological projects. If we fail to agree – and this is the last moment to agree – we lose around EUR 570 million of the 2010 margins and therefore also lose the field of manoeuvre in the 2011 margin. So I think voting and agreeing ITER should be a win-win situation for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">What remains is also the adjustment, the transposition of the Lisbon Treaty in the form of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the new interinstitutional agreement. I have to praise the efforts of the budgetary rapporteur, Reimer Böge, and Minister Wathelet to find agreement in this very area, involving also a degree of flexibility. That is right. I can hear in Parliament, in the discussion, that this is more limited than the current system, but this is a compromise that is really guaranteeing, in practice, the same level of flexibility that was applied until now. Therefore, it seems to be acceptable in this time of fiscal consolidation in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to pursue our efforts in the transposition of the Lisbon Treaty via the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the new interinstitutional agreement as otherwise, with stalemate and delay in these areas, we are in uncharted territory, not on solid ground when it relates to the legal conditions of our attempts for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was the Lisbon Treaty tested in practice. This was not demonstrated as originally designed, as facilitating compromise and decision making, but I hope that we can draw conclusions from the experience and, anticipating the vote in Parliament, we have already started the preparations for the 2012 budget. This is a sign of our optimism. I thank all those involved in the compromise machinery over the 2011 annual budget, Alain Lamassoure, President Buzek, Minister Wathelet and the rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, we are now trying out the effects of the Treaty of Lisbon on ourselves. We and, generally speaking, the European media have often said that the powers of Parliament have increased tremendously as a result of this Treaty. Well, it is true that the two arms of the budgetary authority are about equally strong, but the strength of this arm cannot really be put to use, as the Treaty has condemned us to agreement. The only case where the powers of Parliament would be more extensive, namely, if the Council were to vote itself down in the future, is completely unimaginable. We must all face the fact that if we carry on with one twelfths, we can only stumble from one month to the next, and not make a European Union, and therefore, essentially in agreement with the other groups, the European People’s Party considers it necessary for the European Union to have a valid budget over the course of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The basis of this budget will be the budget submitted by the European Commission back in the summer and deemed by Parliament to be well-founded and sound. The Council was more or less of the same opinion, as it did not modify it much, and only lowered the level of payments somewhat, on the grounds of the big crisis. It is a funny crisis if, apparently, it can be solved with four billion compared to the income of the European Member States. To be honest, this level of cut could be considered somewhat populist. What pleased me in the final agreement, when Parliament adopted this four billion cut, was that we did not cut down numbers on a lawnmower principle, but instead retained the important areas that Parliament was particularly sensitive about as priority areas.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I for one consider it very important that there has been a significant, almost 15% increase in the funds available for cohesion policy support. It is also important that we achieve some measure of progress. I understand the signal, Mr President, I will stop in a moment, but I still need to say that Parliament made a big mistake at the end of the negotiation process, and interests rooted in party politics made it bitterly difficult for us to achieve all of our goals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to pick up on what Mr Surján said. We are dealing with a new procedure in which the two parts of the budgetary legislator, the Council and Parliament, are operating on the same level. I would like to address all those fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets who have complained that this debate has become politicised. I would like to say to you that the logic of this new procedure dictates that we go beyond technical budgetary matters and discuss real budgetary policy. With this budgetary policy, it has become clear that, in the other authorities and in the European Council, there is an intention to use budgetary policy to obtain a different European Union. I will therefore start with the Presidency of the Council – with you, Mr Wathelet.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, this Parliament is indebted to the Belgian Presidency, because I believe that it has helped to achieve something that I did not believe possible three weeks ago. In the Council, the government of the United Kingdom and the government of the Netherlands – we must also mention them by name here – were not prepared to agree on a compromise in respect of the involvement of Parliament in the Financial Perspective. The compromises that we wanted with the Council were rejected. Right up to the last minute, they tried to reach a compromise, but these two governments said ‘no’. A very intelligent solution – a Belgian solution perhaps – was found, namely to get the governments that will hold the Presidency in the next two years – Hungary, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus – to issue a statement to the effect that they will involve Parliament in the development of objectives. I assume this will be as before, in other words, on the basis of the current interinstitutional agreement. Thus, four governments in the European Council have declared that they are of a different opinion to the government of the Netherlands and the government of the United Kingdom. That is a major success, because it has made it clear that the Council is not a homogeneous whole that can dictate a uniform objective, but that there are most definitely different opinions in the Council, for example, in the case of states like Hungary or Poland, who fear that, with the financing of the External Action Service, ITER and Galileo using the same budgetary resources that we have today, but with agricultural spending frozen until 2013, cuts will have to be made somewhere at some point. Moreover, the cuts would then be made in connection with cohesion policy. Thus, we have allies in the Council, namely, those states that do not want these cuts, and these include, in particular, the next two states to hold the Presidency, Poland and Hungary. In this respect, Parliament has achieved a major success.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not share the opinion of Mrs Trüpel that we have given way – quite the opposite! With regard to the second core political demand that we made, flexibility, no agreement was reached. The matter has been deferred. Mr Wathelet, you say that there is now unanimity and that you could have had the qualified majority. I will turn this on its head and say that those who want to have ITER must then also ensure that there is unanimity in the Council for cooperation with regard to flexibility, otherwise they will not get ITER.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have negotiated hard and in a highly controversial manner. At the end of the day, it was never about figures, but about political will.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, my third point is that, in a fierce debate, the Commission has positioned itself between the Council and Parliament. In the Council, there is not a single government that is prepared to discuss our own resources. We want to discuss our own resources. The Commission has taken its position. On this issue, it has sided with Parliament. Thus, the Community institutions are in agreement. In the spring, I expect the President of the Commission and you, Mr Lewandowski, to put forward a corresponding proposal on the arrangements for own resources in the EU. The Member States – the 27 governments – will then have to take a position on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am a little surprised that I am the only group chair to speak here today. I would also like to address my fellow Members in that regard. There was, to some extent, a heated debate between us and the budget experts. I believe that, in the end, this went in a positive direction. I would like to thank the budget rapporteurs, Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel. Through my increased involvement with the budget at a political level, I have learnt how difficult this business is. I would like to compliment you greatly on your work. Finally, I would like to apologise to all those members of the Committee on Budgets who have, at times, felt that I have provoked them. I have to say to you, however, that I considered this provocation necessary.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would also like to start by thanking Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel for the sound and high quality work that they have done on the budget, and perhaps Mrs Jędrzejewska in particular, who has had an unbelievably difficult task under the new procedure. I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency, which made a fantastic contribution, and I also think that our chair, Mr Lamassoure, has done some splendid work during these negotiations. The Commission has, of course, also endeavoured to make a constructive contribution, particularly during the final phase here.</p>
      <p sl="da">From the point of view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, this is a good result for the 2011 budget. We have secured the necessary appropriations for research, energy and education, and in the area of foreign affairs we have found the money for Palestine and the banana-producing countries without making cuts in other programmes. This budget procedure has shown that the Multiannual Financial Framework is very strict and inflexible. We have still not solved the problem of the financing of the ITER fusion energy project for the next few years – something that has been mentioned by several people. The ALDE Group would like a solution to be found to this. If we are to continue to fulfil the ambitions set out in the EU’s energy policy, we will face difficult budget negotiations over the next few years too, unless we have an agreement that ensures greater flexibility. I hope this will happen soon and, in this regard, I would like to thank Mr Böge for his untiring efforts to ensure that a good solution is found.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, just a month ago, although we broadly had an agreement on the figures for the 2011 budget, the four large political groups intervened very loudly and forcefully, asking the Belgian Presidency to negotiate with the Council not only the 2011 figures, on which there was agreement, but also a genuine political agreement for the next stage, a political agreement which would allow us to work together, in the form of a convention or something else – it hardly matters – but also with the national parliaments and governments, on the future financial framework and on own resources. Everyone was in agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We asked for this at the time, just a month ago, because we thought that we had to guarantee the future of European finances, because we thought that we needed to come to the rescue of the budgets of the Member States, which are all facing difficulties, and because the European Union must have its own resources. Everyone agreed, and I would say that it was said in a very forceful way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One month later, where are we on this? We have gone back to square one. The 2011 budget is about to be adopted. It ignores flexibility and ITER. I have no regrets about ITER, as you know, but on the other hand, the Belgian Presidency – even if it has gone to enormous effort, I admit – is sugaring the pill for us somewhat today by proposing that we make do with a Council statement, with the wisdom of the Commission – though I hope that it will always be on the side of Parliament; that is its proper place – and with the letter from Mr Leterme, the Prime Minister, which actually proposes that we should respect the treaties. It is a good thing that he is not proposing the opposite to us – that would be astonishing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You must admit, therefore, that this is a pretty lightweight proposal, and you must realise that we are a little frustrated. I am not even sure that the Belgian Presidency itself totally believes what it says, although, if the ‘walk in the park’ had lasted a little longer, Mr Wathelet, we might have been able to reach a better agreement, a stronger agreement for the future, which would give us more chance of providing proper guarantees for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have the sense that there is too little here, and I do too. Even so, we will act properly, and we will accordingly approve the resolution, with all its drawbacks, and as for everything else, we have missed an opportunity, but rest assured that we will be there at the next meeting, because the debate on the perspectives is not over.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall try to be briefer than the previous speaker. My group proposes to adopt the budget as agreed by the Council. It offers a small increase and that is a reasonable compromise. Keep in mind that EU Member States and citizens have to cut their budgets. Unfortunately, the debate on the budget had a false start. The Parliament demanded an increase of 6%, which was ludicrous and showed that this congregation was out of touch. Here, the debate was even inflamed by hotheads who wanted to kidnap the budget to force access to own resources, in other words, EU taxation. We have always opposed that. Lisbon is clear on it. The Parliament has a right to advise, not a right to codecide.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Parliament lost this battle, as we predicted. Now it is moving to the position which the European Conservatives defended all along – a budget of 1% of GDP. The hotheads here must cool down, particularly the Greens. Just imagine that the EU had no budget next year while the euro was in a tailspin. Is that the image you want to offer the financial markets? They would not be at all happy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, with the adoption of the draft 2011 budget, we come to the end of a turbulent negotiating process. First, a few words on the budget itself. It is the result of the imposition of the governments’ increases, which were residual amounts. The proposal tabled by the governments, and on which we are going to vote tomorrow, is well below the limits agreed when the Financial Perspectives for the period 2007-2013 were negotiated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My group contested this point of view because we do not agree with continuity budgets in exceptional times, and we do not agree with budgets that are unable to address the social crisis into which austerity policies have plunged our countries. This alone would be enough for us not to be able to vote for this budget. However, the underfunding has another consequence: it will require successive corrections throughout 2011, and the governments themselves are admitting it by signing a protocol that says exactly that.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Now, about the future: the majority of those who will vote for this budget were hoping, at least, that this budget would not be repeated in 2012 and in 2013, but nothing could be less certain. Despite our criticisms, my group supported Parliament’s positions throughout the impasse, in order to avoid this very real risk. However, the final commitment is a weak one. I guarantee you that, in 2012, we will be having a revised and extended version of the discussion that we had this year, because a minority of governments, led by the United Kingdom, believe the current European budgets to be excessive: they want less, they do not want more. Moreover, these same governments also want to reduce flexibility. These are the governments that like sanctions and detest solidarity; they are the governments that want hyper-austerity and not social progress. It is for this reason that this Europe – a Europe that rejects European bond issues, a Europe that refuses to tax financial transactions – is a Europe that is set to destroy its own European project. It is not a Europe that we can be at peace with, and so we cannot vote for this budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be brief to compensate for the time that Mr Portas took. Many Members in this Chamber will congratulate themselves on having obtained a 2.9% increase for the EU budget 2011. Others instead will complain that this is not enough. I, for one, deplore the fact that this Parliament ignores the crisis that Europeans are going through and only looks to satisfy its own ambitions. I, for one, regret that Mr Cameron approves such an increase while imposing severe cuts in the British budget, a situation that has started to generate civil unrest.</p>
      <p sl="en">This money is not going to improve the economy of those Member States, nor is it going to provide jobs for those who are losing them, but if kept in Britain, it would avoid the need to increase the tuition fees, for example. Of course we will not vote in favour of this budget as increased.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this morning, I received an email invitation to a cocktail party from the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets. They wanted to celebrate the fact that the European Parliament was able to increase its budget for 2011.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If it were up to this Parliament and the Commission, a lot more money would have been taken out of our citizens’ pockets. European taxes: a reason for a celebratory cocktail! Member States losing their right to veto the budget: another reason for a party! Mr President, I call that dancing on the grave of citizens’ rights! Fortunately, though, there is a cause for celebration. The budget increase has been capped, after heavy pressure from Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, this still means no reduction, which is what the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) wanted, but the increase is not nearly as high as this House wanted. We will not have any European taxes, to the anger of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), and Member States will retain their right of veto. So, when I raise a glass today, then it will be to those courageous, stubborn Member States, like the Netherlands, that have refused to agree to this Parliament’s demands. Long live Member States, long live citizens!</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mrs Jedrzejewska, Mrs Trüpel, Mr Lamassoure, Mr Lewandowski and Mr Böge are the names behind a 2011 budget that I believe has ultimately proved to be moderate and realistic.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Budgets had already drawn up a draft which, in terms of commitment appropriations, was completely in line with the financial restrictions, and left payment appropriations open for negotiation, because as the European Commission said, there were, and continue to be, fears regarding changes in payment appropriations in the Structural Funds for next year.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately, following the vote in plenary in October, we got involved in political negotiations involving the Council, and since then, everything has gone badly: the ‘letter from the Twelve’; the 2.9% increase in payment appropriations imposed by the Council; the pressure on Parliament and its Members; and the final failure expressed in the cancellation of the meeting of the Committee on Budgets that should have taken place yesterday in order to try to reach an agreement on the flexibility and future financing of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER).</p>
      <p sl="es">Should we draw conclusions from this? I think we should. The Council should draw conclusions; the subsequent presidencies should draw conclusions; the European Commission should draw conclusions; and so should we.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will give you a conclusion now: leave the negotiations on the EU budget for other years and to the specialists, who are those who have taken the floor today.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome my fellow Member, Mr Schulz, to the Committee on Budgets and remind him that the Committee meets in January.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Council and Parliament have been able to reach an agreement on the budget for 2011 in these difficult times. The budget is a good compromise inasmuch as we have been able to maintain a low rate of increase but have nevertheless found reasonable resources for our priority areas. I would like to say a big thank you to our rapporteurs, Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel, and to the Belgian Presidency, which has made a very constructive contribution.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What concerns me is the long perspectives, because, in the long term, it will be unreasonable if the Member States assign new tasks to the EU but cannot agree on how they should be financed. That will be a major problem in 2012 and 2013 and, of course, as we prepare for the forthcoming financial framework, because it is now clear that a minority of richer net contributor countries, some of which have eurosceptic governments, want to slim down the EU budget at any price, regardless of the consequences. That is an unreasonable position, particularly as they are pushing hard themselves for increased expenditure in certain areas, the IT project for example, and are not able to point to where the savings should be made either. Should we cut back on agricultural aid? Should we rein in the Structural Funds? Some people want this, but the majority says ‘no’.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The problems we are facing in relation to the future are actually internal political problems within the Council and between Member States with different attitudes towards the EU and its budget in the future. The issue that is most controversial is the question of the flexibility mechanisms of the future. For us Social Democrats, there are two issues here.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, it is a matter of principle that we should uphold an interinstitutional agreement that we have had since 1999 and that has worked extremely well. No parliament in the world would accept a reduction in influence, particularly if there were no compelling practical reasons for it. The Council has not been able to present any practical reasons for a reduction in flexibility. The Treaty of Lisbon does not preclude a new agreement with the same content as the current one; rather, it is a question of the political will of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, when the margins diminish at the end of the budget period and, at the same time, new tasks are added, the need for flexibility will also increase. This was pointed out by the Commission in its assessment of the current framework. Despite the fact that all arguments speak in favour of increased flexibility and that it should be easier to apply flexibility, the Council has gone in the opposite direction. That is unacceptable. We know now that there are Member States that see the current dispute about reduced flexibility as preparation for the big battle, resulting in a drastic slashing of the EU budget. If this turns out to be the Council’s line for the future, I am afraid that we will be facing a more permanent budgetary crisis, because we will not accept that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course, I understand that, but there is a difference between those who are net payer Member States and those who are net beneficiary Member States. We must understand that. You could easily say that the UK, the Netherlands, even my own Member State, Sweden, would gain from a cut in the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">But look at those Member States who are really having problems now. Look at Greece, Portugal and Ireland.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, at least we are now having a proper debate with the involvement of the Council’s representative. This debate on next year’s budget has long been about who has done what and why. In many people’s eyes, this has been a debate between the institutions, which, in a way, is a shame, but at the same time, we can perhaps learn something for the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A month ago, I was rather critical of how, in the Council, you are looking at the future and the possibility of financing the priorities that you yourselves have presented, and by this I am referring, in particular, to the Europe 2020 strategies, in other words, how we are to finance the ambitious targets that we have in Europe. My criticism still stands and I therefore think it may be interesting to look at the budget we now have in the light of this in particular.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have agreed on a budget with an increase of 2.91%, which I personally think is an entirely reasonable solution. If the Council had got its way, the research appropriations would have been cut by around half a billion euro compared with the amount originally proposed by the Commission, and in this regard, I have not yet fully understood what the Council was thinking. Parliament later rectified this in its own version, which is a good thing. This means that, in many ways, we went in a better direction, and even if the figures are the same as those the Council wanted, the content is significantly better than the Council’s 2.91%. I think it is worth noting that, even if we keep the same figures, there have been significant shifts in the budget.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr Färm took account of flexibility, and in this regard, the Council needs to consider how it intends, in specific terms, to find the money that is needed for the future investments that we have agreed on, because it will not be possible to find it in future years if it continues with the logic it is currently employing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am obviously pleased that Parliament has finally come to its senses, accepted what, to many of us, was inevitable all along and settled for a 2.9% increase, although I have to say for many of us that does not go far enough. Many of us would have liked to have seen a freeze – or perhaps, in our wildest optimism, a reduction – in the EU budget because the less money that the EU spends, the less it interferes in the lives of ordinary citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is obviously a good result for David Cameron, for Mark Rutte, but it is also a victory for the hard-pressed taxpayers of Europe who have to pay all the bills of the EU institutions. At a time of austerity, at a time of cutbacks in most Member States, it was frankly madness for this Parliament to be trying to increase EU spending by 6%. I am pleased that there has been at least some modicum of common sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">To those who believe in the European project and who believe in European integration – and I am not particularly one of them – you did your cause more damage than anybody else could have done by trying to insist on this ridiculous increase in EU spending when everybody else, every other public institution in Europe, is seeing the pain of cutbacks.

      <p sl="nl">During the final phase of the budget procedure, the Council and the Commission made political statements, especially with a view to involving the European Parliament in the financing of the European Union in the long term. I have two questions about that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My first question is: how are the Council and the Commission going to give concrete form to this cooperation? Will the European Parliament have a joint deciding role in this? I very much doubt this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second question concerns the European tax. In June 2011, the European Commission wants to put forward a proposal for the financing of the European Union for the 2014-2020 period. My question about this is: is an EU tax part of that? If so, that means that the list of possible levies which the European Commission launched in October has been made even longer. If this is about a levy for the financial sector, then any revenue should, in my view, certainly go to Member States, because it was ultimately they who had to save the banks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel, who have carried out the budgetary procedure with a great deal of responsibility and a clear focus on the priorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the 2011 budget: when considering the EU budget, we must always remember that around 95% of the money goes back to benefit citizens. The best example of this is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. At 6%, the EU’s administrative costs are lower than quite a few of its Member States. For many years, the EU budget amounted to plus/minus 1% of GDP. This financed the enlargement from 15 to 27 Member States without any additional budgetary resources. As a result of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have additional tasks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Budget increases are always difficult. However, with themes such as new projects and additional Lisbon tasks, the 2011 budget is also an investment in the future of the EU and in the functioning of its institutions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, given the exceptional constraints we face this year, the agreement that has been reached on the draft budget for 2011 is the best compromise possible. For that, we must thank and congratulate our two rapporteurs, the European Commission and the remarkable Belgian Presidency, to which I would like to express particular gratitude.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Wathelet is a little sad; he has the impression that too little has been done. He should see Parliament’s gesture of granting EUR 570 million to the Member States, rather than assigning this money to ITER, as an act of gratitude to the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the start of these negotiations, Parliament has been anxious to show its awareness of its responsibilities. Now, at the end of the year, when the cohesion of the Union is once again being called into question, the Committee on Budgets is categorically recommending that we end the uncertainty on the 2011 budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the basic problems remain intact. In contrast to some of the national budgets, the Union’s budget is not threatened by bankruptcy. In terms of the statutes, it is a balanced budget, but it stands on the brink of political failure. Europe is financing its ambitions by indulging in words. Yet verbal inflation, the inflation of grandiose and illusory objectives is just as pernicious as monetary inflation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union no longer has the means to finance the decisions that it has already taken, nor the new competences given to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. The Union has also failed to introduce the procedures that would allow it to ensure that, in the absence of Community financing, major joint objectives such as Europe 2020 are incorporated in the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why Parliament attaches so much importance to the agreement achieved alongside the Commission and the future Presidencies for finding a way to secure the financing of future policies, via the Community budget, from new resources, which are no longer a drain on national budgets, and via the national budgets themselves, which are 20 times the size of the tiny European budget. In 2010, the Union has redefined its notion of financial solidarity. 2011 must be the year in which we reinvent budgetary solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, tomorrow’s vote can bring to an end the first approval procedure for the annual budget, in keeping with the Treaty of Lisbon. Negotiations have obviously been difficult. Parliament has put forward extremely important political considerations, but the Council has refused to discuss them. Parliament initially presented a very strongly united front in maintaining its position. The Council was divided, but had the benefit of unanimity and blocked conciliation. We are currently in the position of agreeing on figures. The Council and Commission have accepted, through declarations, the large majority of the European Parliament’s requests. It would have been much better to have an interinstitutional agreement, which would have provided greater security for the future. Unfortunately, Parliament is no longer as united as it was at the start of the negotiations. As a result, there is a lack of funding for ITER.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that it is of paramount importance for us to give the Union the budget which it needs during this crisis period. We have the time we need before the future financial outlooks are approved to reach an agreement on the topics which are still unresolved. The Council needs to understand that it is not beneficial to the Union that the main European policies will be approved through codecision, while the financial resources required to implement these policies are decided on by only one of the parties involved in budgetary cooperation. Parliament must be involved at the same level in both aspects: political and financial.</p>

Mr Schulz makes little effort to keep his irritation with the Council to himself. Mr Verhofstadt seems to have limited his vocabulary to two phrases: European bonds and European taxes. Mr Daul has even suggested that the Netherlands might as well leave the European Union. That is tough language, but it supports only one side of the argument.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When I proposed that we should tackle Parliament’s own budget, however, these gentlemen and their groups did not appear to have heard me. Moreover, I was given the cold shoulder when I proposed that Members should be transparent about the reimbursement they receive for their general expenses every month.

When I suggested that we should prune Parliament’s luxurious information offices, it seemed to give many Members a headache.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Voting against would therefore be a very appropriate thing to do, but my group and my country have managed to prevent the situation from being even worse and that is why I have abstained. Voting in favour of a 2.9% increase in the current climate would be totally inappropriate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting this budget, the European Parliament is showing an enormous sense of responsibility. The truth is, in the face of an economic, financial and social crisis that is slow to loosen its grip on us, it would be bad for the European Union and its citizens not to have a budget for 2011. No one would have understood if Union institutions had sought broad agreements for their budgets from Member States and not succeeded in reaching minimum consensuses for these budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I believe that, although the 2011 budget is not bad, it could have been better. The need for unanimity in the Council for some issues made negotiations more difficult. This was a portent of the difficulties that the Council will face in reaching agreement on the next Multiannual Financial Framework and on new own resources, which, as we know, require unanimity in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At this point, I would like to highlight the excellent work by Mrs Jędrzejewska as rapporteur, and also by Mrs Trüpel, the efforts of the Belgian Presidency and the conduct of the Commission. The priorities that we have set out are included in this budget:– I would highlight the strengthening of support for youth, education and innovation, and research. I would also like to highlight the preparatory action ‘Your First EURES Job’, which will boost the mobility of young people within the EU, in the area of employment. I worked on this proposal personally, and I hope that after acquiring legal basis, this preparatory action will give rise to a programme with a substantial budgetary allocation. Another positive aspect was the agreement reached for the Commission to present, by the end of September 2011 at the latest, updated values relating to allocations for cohesion policy and for rural development, and, if necessary, increasing these allocations.</p>

The unsuccessful first attempt to reach an agreement and include the European Parliament’s legitimate demands demonstrates a conflict that is still present among the institutions and that should not actually exist, as it is obstructing effective interinstitutional cooperation. Presumably, it cannot be denied that the objective of all EU institutions is to ensure that agreements which are particularly important for the whole of the EU and its citizens are adopted as smoothly as possible. In future, therefore, there must be fundamental changes in the operating principles of the institutions themselves and the inclusion of the European Parliament in all stages of negotiations, particularly in budget adoption, must be considered as particularly important for the implementation of the principle of representative democracy.</p>

There need to be continuing negotiations and a harmonised approach regarding conciliation on annual and multiannual budget frameworks, so that the institutions are able to speak one and the same language around the negotiating table.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now, however, we can probably be satisfied that there is a budget in place for 2011. The uncertain elements need to be kept to a minimum in this economic maelstrom.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the 2011 budget as it has emerged from the numerous conciliation procedures between our Committee on Budgets, the Council and the Commission does not conform to the new institutional balances defined by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These balances have not been respected by the Council or, in particular, by the representatives of a number of governments. In particular, it is unacceptable that Parliament’s request to obtain a dialogue on the EU’s future own resources has come to nothing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Parliament now has a joint decision-making power in budgetary matters. It must ensure that it is respected, and we have to realise something: genuinely balanced conciliation procedures will probably not be possible until this joint decision-making power is exercised in the form of a negative vote.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At some point, the European Parliament will have to choose to assert its institutional position firmly. This issue of own resources will resurface in the coming months. If we want to succeed, we will have to be able to see our responsibilities through to the end.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I cannot vote for any increase in the Parliament’s budget, and I believe that many people in the United Kingdom will be watching the proceedings here in utter amazement. In national economies across Europe, we have austerity measures and budget cuts. These are the order of the day and this is what our people have to face.</p>
      <p sl="en">The euro is in crisis, and I want the House to note that even though my constituency does not use the euro, we share a land border with the Republic of Ireland. The Republic represents a huge export market for us, so this crisis hurts our people as well. Beside all this crisis, we have a proposed 2.9% increase, limited from the 6% that Parliament already wanted, but on a budget that the Court of Auditors has not passed for many years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most worryingly of all, we have a promise from the Commission to bring forward proposals by June 2011 for an EU tax. Is it any wonder that Euroscepticism is growing?</p>

      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to share with you my concern and my displeasure about the choice made today by some political groups and, in particular, the Socialists, whose representatives were in government jobs at key moments, to jeopardise ITER, the only fundamental long-term research project in the European Union in which we play a leading role.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the European Union made a commitment last June to contribute an additional EUR 1.3 billion to this project, which is crucial for our security. It is therefore Europe’s credibility in the world that is going to be called into question by our vote. This attitude has meant that we have lost nearly EUR 600 million of unused money in 2010, which could have been allocated to ITER. This is ridiculous!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a Member of the European Parliament, I feel responsible that we have a budget. As a Socialist, I am very sorry that we would not go for a financial transaction tax. As a rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I would like to underline that we support the ITER project, but we do not need a patchwork solution for one year: we need a sustainable financial solution for the next two decades. As a Hungarian, I am very happy that the Hungarian Presidency will hopefully not have to deal with the budget, but only to find a solution for ITER and for flexibility during the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall be brief as I have already used up my time slot. In answer to Mr Belder, who may have already disappeared, the Commission’s proposal on how to cooperate between the institutions was in direct implementation of Articles 312, 324 and, specifically, Article 311 of the Lisbon Treaty, for the specific procedure on the own resources decision in full respect of the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the own resources, this was clearly and explicitly within the mandate given to the Commission in December 2005, which was confirmed by Parliament, to start not only the expenditure but also the revenue side of the budget, including the British rebate. We were delicate enough not to touch the issue of the British rebate in our budgetary review and our eventual choice for the future is not to increase the expenditure but to change the proportions between the national direct payment and own resources, in line with the vision of the treaty and the founding fathers of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a more general remark: hopefully, if we vote tomorrow, our test of Lisbon, in budgetary terms, will be over and we will have to draw conclusions. It sends a good message to European citizens to have a budget without any deficits or debt and to show that we are not to be taken as a scapegoat for the failed policies in some Member States. Therefore, now having the budget in place, we should continue our discussion on the modalities of interinstitutional cooperation in much improved circumstances.</p>

    <intervention id="2-502" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Melchior Wathelet" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, like the Commissioner, I do not have much to add in relation to this discussion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Quite simply, having heard some Members say that they preferred not to approve the budget in order to affirm Parliament’s joint decision-making powers, I think that all the European institutions have much more to gain and will increase their standing if they can actually take the European Union forward by finding compromises, instead of everyone blocking each other and not moving forward with European projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that this is a question of logic, and today I really want to thank all those who have chosen to build Europe and to move forward. Does the Council have everything that it wanted? No. Does Parliament have everything that it wanted? Of course not. Are we moving forward? Yes. This codecision procedure has functioned; it has worked. Everyone has made some compromises. Everyone has made some concessions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is there still much to be done? Of course. Clearly, that is what the debate on flexibility and ITER is all about. I regret the fact that we were not able to reach an agreement, and I have heard it said that the proposal tabled was a step backwards. No. I repeat: we have this during every debate, and today it is unanimity. If the aim is to move towards qualified majority, then I think that the Belgian Presidency’s proposal must be taken up. I think that this is essential when it comes to drafting the 2012 and 2013 budgets. I think that this mechanism really must be promoted, since it conforms to past practices, but it at least ensures that the 2012 and 2013 budgets can no longer be blocked by unanimity. I believe that you really must seize this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning ITER, the way in which we have used this flexibility mechanism for ITER 2010 clearly shows that we will need this mechanism and that we must take up what is before us today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to sincerely thank all those speakers – and I will not mention them all – who have acknowledged the work that we have done together to move forward. I would like to thank all those who preferred the logic of progress to the logic of blocking. I think that we really must promote this logic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Lamassoure, you spoke of budgetary solidarity. In the Council, we had almost total solidarity, as everyone accepted the increase of 2.91%. We have gone from having a qualified majority to having total unanimity within the Council. Joking aside, I think that all of the statements annexed to this 2011 budget – because, yes, a budget in itself is also political, as Parliament showed with the political priorities that it included in the budget – whether on own resources, on European added value, on Lisbonisation – the Commission’s declaration – or in the context of this joint statement, which is important and which has already been followed by a letter from the Belgian Prime Minister, the current President of the European Union, I think that all these statements show that all the stages are going in the right direction. We are certainly not moving as quickly as everyone would like, but we are moving quickly enough that we can say that the machine is in working order and that it is better to adhere to this logic of progress than to a logic of blocking.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, from what the previous speakers have said, it is clear that we are all pleased that it will be possible to implement the 2011 EU budget efficiently and without unnecessary delays as of 1 January next year. However, all these speeches have also made it clear that there is still a lack of certain things. There is a lack of discussion and a lack of understanding. It is clear to me already that the Treaty of Lisbon opens up new, uncharted territory for us and that a very difficult debate awaits us regarding the new multiannual post-2013 European Union budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This debate relates to a fundamental issue, namely, how we can reconcile the ever-greater divergence between expectations of the European Union, or, in other words, what the European Union is supposed to do – and we can see that the Member States and all interested parties, including the European Parliament, expect more and more from the European Union, since the European Union is supposed to deal with an ever-increasing number of subject areas, and is opening itself up to new policies, new areas of activity and setting new tasks for itself – a divergence between the aforesaid expectations and an ever-diminishing willingness to finance these new undertakings. We must hold joint debates on this increasingly dramatic divergence. We cannot avoid such debates, all the more so since we are currently experiencing a financial and economic crisis, and so there is no place for taboo subjects as far as funding is concerned. We should talk openly about all the issues: about the EU’s own revenues, about what the EU should do, about what it should perhaps not try to do, about what is really most important for us and to what extent these priorities should be financed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In summary, I think that what happened during the adoption of the 2011 budget is both a basis for and a start of the debate, but by no means its end. I thank you for your willingness to engage in a debate, and I hope that there will be even more of this willingness next year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am pleased that I get to have the last word in this debate today. I will start by gladly accepting Mr Schulz’s apology. He said that he had sometimes behaved badly. It is always good when he notices that he occasionally makes too much noise. His comment that we previously only dealt with technical budgetary matters and have now realised that this is a question of budgetary policy is something that I wish to firmly reject. I have been working in the Committee on Budgets for six years now and even before this, it was always a matter of budgetary policy and not just the technical aspect. Mr Schulz said that he has learnt a great deal over the last few weeks. I am pleased to hear that. In that case, he will probably understand this now.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will now turn to the anti-European tones that have just been heard in this House. I would like to emphasise clearly once again that if – as stated in the Treaty of Lisbon – we have a goal to discuss new own resources for Europe, this would not only be an additional tax for European citizens, but would also mean that the payments from the gross domestic product were reduced by the same amount. In other words, it would not simply put a greater burden on citizens, it would also provide a more transparent system for our own resources. This needs to be debated. I reject the attempt to manipulate opinion by implying that there will only be additional burdens. Rather, the goal is to find an intelligent financing system. The Council and Parliament should be prepared to do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second comment, because it has simply been presented here as if European taxpayers are always having things taken away from them by the European Union, is that there are education programmes for European citizens, there is new infrastructure, there are new languages and there is help for dairy farmers. In other words, what we are doing here is in the well-understood interests of European citizens, and that needs to be said loud and clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the global role of the European Union in the coming years? We have such successful countries as China, India, Brazil and others with which we compete at a global level. If, as the European Union, we want to be strong and to have new products that will hopefully also be sustainable, new production methods that are environmentally responsible, energy generation that is genuinely based on renewable energy sources, which was once again established as a goal in Cancún, then for this we also need appropriate resources and we need the European budget, which reflects our common interests. I hope that we will move in this direction in the next few years.</p>

      <p sl="de">I welcome the fact that we have finally come to an agreement on the 2011 budget. This will ensure financial security for the vulnerable agriculture sector. EU agricultural policy needs a stable budget framework, in particular, during difficult times. A twelve-part budget would have caused serious financial difficulties for many Member States which have already passed on agricultural payments to farmers. Agriculture is heavily dependent on EU subsidies. Farming families need the security to plan ahead for the future of their businesses. Throughout the EU, direct payments represent 40% of farm incomes and provide financial security against a background of low producer prices, increasing production costs and fluctuating markets. The measures which form part of the rural development programme bring direct benefits for rural areas and stimulate regional economies. Farms in Austria, in particular, benefit from both the 1st and 2nd pillar measures. A total of 58 percent of Austria’s annual agricultural budget comes from the EU. Farmers in the European Union have a wide range of responsible jobs to do which are increasing in number. They have to produce top quality food and comply with high standards of animal welfare while helping to prevent climate change, protect the environment and maintain biodiversity. In order to be able to provide these essential services, farmers must have a reliable income based on sensible, stable EU financial policy. As far as the negotiations on the financial framework for 2014-2020 are concerned, all aspects of agriculture must have the same level of budget funding.</p>

      <p sl="el">The impasse in the first stage of the 2011 EU budget caused by the intransigent stand taken by a limited minority of Member States almost took us into the fiasco of twelfths and all that such a system implies, both in terms of the budgets of the economically weak Member States and the possibility of serious delay in payments of European funds. In order to avoid this fiasco, Parliament has demonstrated the necessary sense of responsibility and is prepared to accept a budget, despite the fact that it does not satisfy all its demands and is not up to par, as the European public might expect if we are to tackle the economic crisis. However, the problem as to how budgetary needs are to be addressed in the immediate future for 2012 and 2013 persists and I call on this small minority of Member States to demonstrate a proper sense of responsibility and to work with Parliament to find a solution that will give the EU the necessary flexibility to address its needs and prevent a new budgetary crisis.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, here we are in the third act of the financial legislation for 2010. Following supervision, following the directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are once again looking at credit rating agencies. I say ‘once again’ because Europe has not been slow in bringing in a regulation in this area which was conceived in 2009 and which is now taking effect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Credit rating agencies, in general, issue opinions, literally in the form of ratings, on the creditworthiness of businesses and states and on complex financial products. The rating reflects an assessment of the risk of issuers of financial instruments not being able to honour their debts. These agencies have gradually become very important in the financial world, for a variety of reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments. The second reason is that ratings have been a factor in the success of issues, since they have become a major indicator for investors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet, although credit rating agencies were not the main cause of the recent financial crisis, they did have a harmful influence. Indeed, they underestimated the probability that issuers of certain complex financial instruments would default.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with the need to restore confidence in the markets and to strengthen protection for investors, in 2009, the European Commission proposed a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies. Thus, in the same year, Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies was adopted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During the debates in the European Parliament preceding the adoption of this regulation, your rapporteur stressed the need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies’ products and integrated supervision of them. At the time, European supervision of this type was legally impossible. However, the Commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines, and you, Commissioner, kept this promise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the architecture of European supervision, which will enter into force on 1 January 2011, now makes the effective implementation of rating agency supervision possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is stressed in the Regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority that this authority will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies. That was the objective of the additional amending regulation on which we reached an agreement and on which we will vote tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I wanted – and my colleagues supported this request – was for the other issues relating to credit rating agencies, allocation of sovereign debt, remuneration schemes and competition, to be postponed and dealt with in a study taking the form of an own-initiative report, which will precede the legislative proposal that you are due to make in the first half of 2011 and for which you have launched a consultation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that, by establishing European supervision of credit agencies, we are taking a big step along the same lines as the supervision arrangements that have been implemented. I now want to thank the Belgian Presidency for its tireless efforts on the financial dossiers, you and your teams, Commissioner, and, obviously, my fellow Members in the European Parliament who participated in this study and who supported our positions.</p>

    <intervention id="2-511" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olivier Chastel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after Mr Gauzès and a report of this kind, it is clearly a pleasure to be among you on behalf of the Belgian Finance Minister, Didier Reynders, on the day of the debate concerning the amendment of the regulation on credit rating agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, as you have just said, we are talking about a measure relating to financial services on which the three institutions have just reached an agreement in record time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also very pleased that this agreement will be voted on in Parliament tomorrow, as agreed, between the three institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The regulation will therefore be modified to allocate additional powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority. This will allow the authority to exercise stricter supervision of the activities of credit rating agencies throughout the Union. This is an important step which we also think will contribute to improving the stability of the financial markets, and which will support the development of a much more effective supervisory framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once the regulation enters into force, therefore, the authority will have powers concerning the registration and direct supervision of credit rating agencies. It will also have the power to determine that a credit rating agency has infringed the regulation in force and the power to impose appropriate penalties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, a framework will also be provided for cooperation between the competent authorities in the Member States and the European Securities and Markets Authority. However, we are prepared to have a more in-depth debate on the issue of regulating the credit rating agency sector itself once the Commission has provided us with its proposal on the comprehensive review of this sector, which is set for next year. While I am obviously hoping for a positive result from your vote tomorrow, I would particularly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Bowles, Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and its shadow rapporteurs, of course, as well as Commissioner Barnier, who, alongside the Belgian Finance Minister, Mr Reynders, carried out important work for six months, securing swift agreements that have been transformed in this very Parliament into real decisions in the financial sector. Anyway, thank you for your fruitful and effective collaboration in this area. I am sure that you will continue this work during the Presidencies to come.</p>

    <intervention id="2-512" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, good afternoon to you all. You spoke very well, Mr Gauzès, as did Mr Chastel just now, on behalf of Mr Reynders, about the supervision and regulation of the large hedge fund and private equity sector, today, and about this second stage of credit rating agency regulation, tomorrow, which is clearly being undertaken with and thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, and thanks to the Council and to the initial work of the Commission. On the subject of regulation, Europe is making concrete and effective progress, and it is learning the lessons of the crisis, as all taxpayers, who are also European citizens, are demanding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on the supervision of credit rating agencies is an important step, and I, too, would like to thank you, Mr Gauzès, and, of course, those working alongside you, the Committee Chair, Mrs Bowles, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Klinz, Mr Giegold, Mr Pittella and Mr Fox. In a few days’ time, this Presidency will come to an end, having had much success and having made a lot of progress, and I want to give my sincere thanks to Mr Reynders and to his whole team for the good relations we have maintained throughout the last six months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a good agreement, even though I have to say that it would have been excellent if, in the final compromise, we had taken up the rules that the Commission initially proposed for reinforced transparency regarding structured financial instruments. However, as was indicated in the recitals of the regulation, we will come back to this subject, if you wish, during the next revision of the regulation in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Chastel said just now, from July 2011, this amendment to the 2009 regulation will give ESMA, the new Securities and Markets Authority, the direct power to supervise credit rating agencies at European level. Ladies and gentlemen, the importance of this decision that you are taking today really must be understood. This is the first time that ESMA, this new European authority, will have the power to directly supervise financial institutions operating across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This amendment completes the new European supervision framework. It strengthens ESMA’s powers considerably, as you explained very well, Mr Gauzès, and as Mr Giegold, who is here, was also anxious to point out during the debate on supervision. This is therefore a very important subject for you, and it is also a very important subject for us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">ESMA will become the institution responsible for registering rating agencies and supervising them throughout the Union, and it will exercise strict control. The legislation will grant it all the supervisory powers deemed necessary to force rating agencies to comply with the terms of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">ESMA will be able to exercise supervision – I am thinking here of requests for information and the power to carry out spot checks – and if it notices that a credit rating agency is committing a violation, it will have to take the measures necessary to force the agency to put a stop to that violation. ESMA will also have the power, strictly regulated by clear rules, to impose fines and penalties on rating agencies which do not respect the regulation. Clearly, this regulation also guarantees the rights of defence of rating agencies, in particular, the right to a hearing, access to documents and other procedural guarantees. Finally, when exercising a supervisory power, ESMA will respect the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the other principles and provisions of European Union law, including the proportionality principle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new regulation on rating agencies will also ensure a single point of contact for all rating agencies, a regulatory framework which is harmonised across the European Union, with equal treatment, and a more consistent application of the rules for agencies throughout the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore think that this represents a considerable gain in efficiency, transparency and security within the general architecture that we are constructing week by week in order to achieve intelligent supervision and effective regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I do not want to speak at great length as I did just now, but I would perhaps like to expand on what Mr Chastel said and mention the next stage, since I myself said that we must go further to ensure the proper regulation of rating agencies, while noting that the agencies are not creating the problem and the turbulence on the financial markets. The thermometer does not cause the fever, but it still needs to work properly, which was not the case in the past, and that is what we want to remedy, so to speak, with these successive regulations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is already considering the next stage: a public consultation was launched on 5 November 2010 to broaden this debate and to collect the points of view of all the parties concerned, and, as you know, there is nothing artificial about the debates regarding all these regulations. Ladies and gentlemen, I truly set great store by listening to every contribution, criticism or idea made in the context of these consultations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We shall now consider, first, the consequences of the issuer-pays model, which is widespread among rating agencies; second, the dependence of the banks and other institutional investors on credit ratings; third, the rating of sovereign debt – which is not a straightforward matter; fourth, increasing transparency in order to manage conflicts of interest better; and fifth, creating more competition and diversity in this rating agencies market, which is currently concentrated in too few hands.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This consultation is open until next January and, on the basis of all the responses that we receive, and of Mr Klinz’s own-initiative report, we will take a decision at some point in 2011, but not too late, regarding the measures that we want to implement in order to complete, through a third stage, these two regulations on rating agencies, which are now almost implemented.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a Vice-Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to present some important aspects that were the subject of the debates and amendments tabled in this committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, at the present time, payment for the structured instruments evaluated by the agencies is made by the issuing company. There can be conflicts of interest because the rated companies are interested in having a good rating. Alternatively, it might be the users of ratings who pay. The users’ interests are more diverse and therefore, there is not a single interest that can lead to a conflict of interest. There are users who prefer a good rating, for instance, when they want to sell shares, and those who prefer a bad rating, for instance when they want to buy shares.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the regime for the rating agencies could profit from the rules that have been established for the auditors. The rating agencies and auditors have a lot of responsibility for the good reputation of companies and the proper functioning of the market. Auditors, however, seem to be subject to far stricter rules than the rating agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, should have supervisory competence over the credit rating agencies in order to verify possible material discrepancies between the ratings given by different agencies for the same structured financial instrument. ESMA should also have greater power of enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, the directive introduces a new principle, taken from the latest US legislation. When an agency other than the one contracted to make the valuation can do its valuation for the same instrument, it is subject to the contracted valuation. For this, the first agency must disclose certain information regarding the valuated instrument. In such a way, two beneficial effects are obtained – firstly, there is a second opinion and, secondly, the liability that falls on the contracted agency is reduced.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to underline the fact that the provisions of this directive, which represents a new regulatory frame, should only apply to the structured financial instruments, credit rating agencies themselves being an important part of structured finance. The remainder of the financial instruments, 150 year-old common shares or plain bonds which do not pose a systemic risk should not be part of this directive if you want to be tight but not to over-regulate, if you want to be competitive but not expensive in administrative costs, and if you want to hold capital in Europe and not drive it away to the emerging markets abroad.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to our now tried-and-tested cooperation, we have worked productively with Mr Gauzès on this regulation to ensure some important advances in the rules governing one of the most controversial areas for the stability of the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">One such improvement is undoubtedly the plan for the newly formed European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to be able to directly penalise credit rating agencies for misconduct. This was a point that I very much insisted on. Parliament is showing in this way that it is fighting for the creation of a strong European supervisory body that is equipped with real powers.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are also aware that this regulation still does not tackle all the problems in a sector which, in recent years, has been seen to have exacerbated the crisis. The stumbling blocks to be overcome, which are the subject of a parliamentary report already being drafted by Mr Klinz, concern two issues in particular: the evaluation of Member States’ sovereign debt and the general structure of a market characterised by an obvious oligopoly.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union must have a clear objective in relation to these issues, namely, to make finance less dependent on ratings. The references currently contained in the laws and regulations on credit rating agencies must be superseded by alternative creditworthiness standards. The United States and the G20 have already gone in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="it">At international level we need to have the courage and the ambition to change the rules underpinning Basel II, by which I mean the obligation to use ratings – a mechanism that has actually led the banking sector, in the past and still today, to completely give up on supervision, the consequences of which are plain to see.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall conclude with a brief reference to the issue of sovereign debt rating: this should no longer be the responsibility of credit rating agencies, because too often they have exasperated market sentiment with their ratings, fuelling speculation. We should give thought instead to the possibility of a European institution – perhaps an existing institution, such as the European Court of Auditors – playing a role in this area.</p>
      <p sl="it">I really do hope that my suggestions will be endorsed by my fellow Members and will receive the full, authoritative support of Commissioner Barnier, for whom I wish to reiterate my high regard.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks’ time, we will have a new supervisory structure in Europe, which has been shaped to a considerable extent by the European Parliament. Among these three new supervisory authorities will be one that is responsible for markets and securities: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).</p>
      <p sl="de">ESMA will have the last word in connection with the registration and oversight of credit rating agencies and be responsible for ensuring that the credit rating agencies actually comply with the new regulations. If it so wishes, ESMA can delegate this cross-border responsibility to national supervisory authorities if these supervisory authorities are small and only operate nationally.</p>
      <p sl="de">This proposal is therefore nothing more than an adaptation of the regulation of April 2009 to the new circumstances, but it strengthens the role of ESMA. It gives the new supervisory authority more powers and – something that is completely new – it gives ESMA the power to punish non-application of the regulation. I very much welcome this, because I believe that strengthening the position of a new supervisory authority of European mould will genuinely increase its credibility on the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">I just have one point of criticism. When drawing up the regulation in April 2009, we took a political decision with regard to how we should deal with ratings from third countries in Europe. We said at that time that they can be used in Europe if they either comply with the equivalence procedure or are supported by a credit rating agency that is registered and approved in Europe, the so-called endorsement procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has now changed this at level 2 and said that endorsement will no longer be possible. Therefore, only the equivalence procedure actually applies. I consider this – as it was undertaken unilaterally – to be an undemocratic way of going about things, and I believe that we should stick to the decision that we made at the time in April 2009.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the Commissioner also mentioned, there are still a lot of outstanding issues where credit rating agencies are concerned, namely, the lack of competition, insufficient transparency, the business model as to whether the issuer or the investor should pay, which need to be looked at critically. There are questions with regard to the payment system and also with regard to excessive dependency, because in reality, it is the case that, as a result of regulatory provisions, many ratings agencies have become de facto regulatory certification authorities. I am taking this up in the own-initiative report, and I am pleased that the Commission is going to table a legislative proposal on this matter in the next year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, Mr Gauzès, ladies and gentlemen and shadow rapporteurs, I am indeed pleased that we have now taken this step and that for the first time, a sector of the European financial system will be placed under direct European supervision. It is also a step towards a strong Europe in an internal market and the firm control of a sector that contributed to the crisis. I would like to make one more comment on this. Mr Barnier, the selection process is, of course, currently under way for the new authorities, and the new authorities are only as good as their staff. I can only hope that the staff will genuinely be selected on the basis of expertise, independence from the financial industry that they are to control and the clear desire to serve in the public interest, and that we will not see national quotas again in the selection process that disregard these important criteria.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we still have a great deal to do in the area of credit rating agencies. We still have no real transparency when it comes to the information with which the credit rating agencies work and there is far too great a use of regulatory ratings in the financial sector and in the regulations governing the financial industry. We have serious conflicts of interest, we quite clearly have a market power of three major providers and there is no liability for negligently issued ratings. Commissioner, it is good that the consultation is now under way and we await the results with interest. Civil society, in particular, should be involved in this consultation, but then you need to put forward a courageous proposal. I am already looking forward to your proposal. Please be as courageous as you have been up to now, and let us produce legislation together during the next year that solves the problems that are still present on the credit rating market in a genuinely European way. We owe this to our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Gauzès for his excellent work on this subject. I am pleased that Articles 8a and 8b were removed during the trialogue. Initially, the Commission’s draft proposed creating secure websites. I was never convinced. We can see how the situation unfolds in the United States, and if the sites turn out to be useful, we can always introduce them here in Europe afterwards.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the last few months since the beginning of this year have shown the damage that credit rating agencies can do. There is therefore an urgent need for action. I, too, therefore welcome the directive, in particular, the fact that the supervision and registration of credit rating agencies will be transferred to ESMA. That is an important and positive step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, numerous good and progressive proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations on the report. I would like to mention this once again. Thus, the appointment of ESMA remains the only real and positive change. The proposals for a public database for the issuing of credit ratings have been dropped, as has any reference to the establishment of a public credit rating agency. The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about. Moreover, the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products. This, too, has come to nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the reports on this matter that are still to come and that were mentioned by Mr Gauzès and by you, Mr Barnier.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, we are nearing the time of fervent prayers in light of today’s news, once again concerning the euro, for which we are grateful. I very much hope that, with your courageous approach, you will not be too far behind the times. I would like to endorse what the previous speaker said and ask you urgently to ensure, in your sphere of influence, that selections will not only be made on the basis of national quotas, but also that party political preferences will be put aside so that we can finally break with a very awkward tradition in connection with officials, which is specific to Europe, and actually bring in the best people.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second request is for much greater transparency with regard to the competitors on the international market outside the EU, which have constantly made a political issue out of their ratings and have suggested that they have an omniscience that in no way corresponds to what is actually happening on the market or even their importance.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Gauzès, ladies and gentlemen, it is truly a great pleasure for me to note that Mr Gauzès has created such an excellent report. The topic is of extreme importance, and looking at the habits and operation of credit rating agencies, it always has relevance. The rapporteur’s effort to ensure that credit rating agencies and their products are controlled in an integrated way, on the basis of uniform EU standards, deserves support. However, it is important to know what exactly is being rated and how. We must ask these questions, as it is common knowledge that prior to the crisis, these credit rating agencies gave excellent ratings to several thousand billion dollars worth of doubtful or bad securities, thereby unfortunately providing unlimited ground for speculation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">First of all, we must examine the issue of independence, because if it is true that banks and certain investor groups are financing the fees of the evaluations, we might ask the question whether the decisions of credit rating agencies are indeed free of external interests. The second issue is the methodology of ratings. The third issue is that with concerted downgrades and negative rumours, any country can be made insolvent, and in this way, it can be forced to take out new loans and thus remain an increasingly vulnerable client in the debtors’ market. Small, open economies and Member States outside the euro area are particularly vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am therefore convinced that it is incorrect to accept that credit rating agencies are not responsible for the ratings they give. Ladies and gentlemen, let us put ratings in their appropriate place, and rely on them only to the extent of their credibility, and consider them as guidelines when establishing the regulatory framework. The report is more than worthy of support. The global economic crisis has shown that the regulation and EU level supervision of the operations of these institutions are necessary.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, credit rating agencies played, and are still playing, a dishonourable role in the financial crisis. There are too few of them, they are too powerful and too lacking in transparency, and their structure and importance is an example of how badly things have gone awry with our global financial system.</p>
      <p sl="de">Confidence in credit rating agencies can only be restored by establishing new, sound rules for them. Tomorrow, we will vote on one step in this development, the necessary adaptation of credit rating agencies to the new European financial market supervisory structure and adaptation to the new comitology procedure, the delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="de">ESMA will be brought into being. It is authorised to permanently revise ratings, carry out a thorough inspection of credit rating agencies and also to impose penalties that are higher than the profit gained from breaking the law. All of these are new developments that are, as a minimum, absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to point out that the European Securities and Markets Authority should be staffed in such a way as to enable it to actually carry out its tasks efficiently and not by a relatively small staff of ESMA employees who are expected to perform almost superhuman tasks.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should be completely open with regard to the forthcoming major reform of the credit rating agencies and today, we should discuss what seems to be almost impossible or hard to imagine. After all, special purpose entities in which banks deposited their junk bonds received the highest credit rating from the credit rating agencies. Thus, in the major revision, we should consider creating a European public rating agency and changing and examining the payment model. Finally, we should, of course, consider whether there is a need for a second rating. We need a serious, robust form of regulation so that it cannot happen again that three large agencies can bear so much of the responsibility for this current sorry financial situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this reminds me of a phrase in Latin that goes quis custodiet custodes , who will guard the guards? The same is true here. Who is going to rate the credit agencies? Thankfully, we now have an instrument that will do that and, certainly, the credit rating agencies have brought no credit on themselves; rather; they have discredited themselves by their behaviour over the last couple of years and they have exacerbated the financial situation rather than alleviate it.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I am delighted that the European Parliament and our authorities are taking control of the situation and I compliment Mr Gauzès, Mr Barnier and the Council for putting in place an instrument that will deal with this. I am certainly looking forward to tomorrow’s vote on this and, if I am given the opportunity, I will vote three or four times to bring these vultures under control.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the preparation of this very important document. To date, much has been done as regards the creation of a system for financial control and its operation in the European Union. Credit rating agencies play a very important role as they have a direct impact on the operation of the financial system, its soundness and stability. I feel that one major problem is the fact that the EU financial supervisory authorities being set up do not yet have real powers which would enable them to have a direct impact and to take binding decisions. I therefore support the proposals giving one of the European supervisory authorities, in this case, the European Securities and Markets Authority, greater powers to ensure and monitor the transparency of the work of credit rating agencies certified by the EU in order to avoid distortions of the principles of the financial market and the single internal market.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, if we wish to be honest, we must unfortunately declare that credit rating agencies are essentially subsidiaries of the international plutocracy. Through the agencies, they put pressure on countries in an attempt to influence their decisions. The greatest problem with ratings is that they are almost entirely subjective and do not offer an accurate picture of the economic condition of the countries concerned at a given moment in time. These ratings, which are a far cry from reality, clearly hinder countries in recovering from the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Meanwhile, there are, of course, objective indicators, such as the general government deficit or external and internal indebtedness. On the other hand, the establishment of an organisation, a supervisory body, which essentially provides quality control for these institutions, and thereby prevents them from giving often erroneous ratings, is a big step towards a solution. However, I would, at any rate, like to address a question to Mr Barnier regarding the ESMA: we have talked much about how it would impose various sanctions, but when will we know what these sanctions will be, what their extent will be and when they can be introduced? I thank you in advance for your reply.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the aim of the amendments suggested by Mr Gauzès’s report is to provide additional details concerning ESMA’s new powers in relation to national agencies. My view is that the remit should be defined very clearly. In addition, financial market participants should be able to identify the competent authority in the rating agencies sector.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the new authority should have sole responsibility for registering and supervising existing rating agencies. They should have the opportunity to access information about the financial instruments being evaluated by competitors. At the same time, access to websites should only be given if the confidentiality of the information requested can be guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I wish to stress the importance of a credit rating agency being registered by a competent authority and its validity throughout the whole EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am pleased that this is before us here this evening. I have to say that one of the points that is very rarely made is that, until recently, the public sector in Ireland was being regulated by the private sector; it was being regulated effectively by the credit rating agencies and the markets. I am one of those who welcome the fact that we got away from the private sector and, at least, we have the shield of the ECB, the EU and the IMF in the circumstances we are in.</p>
      <p sl="en">I might not agree with the exact package but I think it is a better position for us to be in than to be at the mercy of the credit rating agencies and the markets. The markets are supposed to be free; I think that is something we might have a debate on some other day. But, in relation to the credit rating agencies, one of those agencies was getting USD 800 million a year for rating structured finances. Their impartiality really is being called into account and, when we look back on what they did in the past and even when we look back on what they do now, I think we will look back in dismay. It is time they were called to account and I am glad that there will be stronger supervision for these bodies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to respond accurately, but succinctly to all those who have spoken, to whom I give my thanks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, Mr Bodu, I obviously share your point of view on the risks of the issuer-pays model. I made this point myself in my speech just now. It is therefore a subject which forms part of our consultation in the future proposal, the third stage. As I said to Mr Fox and Mrs Băsescu, we will indeed also return to the matter of structured products. Mr Fox, I listened carefully to your concerns about security as regards exchanges of information, and we will keep an eye on this; we will come back to this point. We will also continue to rely on the competence of ESMA in this area. For us, this is a question of efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Pittella, thank you for your encouragement. I think that it is good that, like Mr Klute and Mrs Gáll-Pelcz, you emphasise the importance of this new supervisory authority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are still some difficult issues to be addressed, which we have identified, and you yourself quite rightly reminded us of them: the lack of competition in this sector, the issue of rating sovereign debt, which Mr Kelly mentioned just now, and which poses a particular problem. We will take these ideas into account in the new consultation phase.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I share Mr Klinz’s view on the importance of penalties and the ability of ESMA to impose them. Mrs Regner also mentioned this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the issue of third countries, Mr Klinz, the aim is to ensure that our requirements remain rigorous, and I say this also to Mr Mitchell, who mentioned Europe’s credibility with respect to these decisions which must be taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am grateful to Mr Giegold for his positive assessment of the progress that we have made together today. On the subject of recruiting people to manage the European authorities, I obviously cannot provide any specific information about names at the moment, but I would like to say to you, Mr Giegold, and also to Mr Martin, that the process is now under way, that it is being conducted completely objectively, and that, as far as I am concerned, the criteria according to which the choice must be made are competence and independence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also say to Mrs Regner that the agencies will gain in power. From the very first teams, they will develop in accordance with the competences that they have been and will be given. We are anxious to ensure the credibility of the agencies’ work in terms of methods and competences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Klute, thank you for your comments. You have clearly identified the problems which remain to be dealt with, and I am conscious, as I have said to several Members, that we will have to thoroughly examine these issues. That is why the idea of dealing with this issue of regulating the agencies in three stages seems to me to be constructive and positive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Balčytis, the agencies, as I have said myself, are not creating the problems. They just need to evaluate the problems properly and the thermometer needs to work properly. With regard to products, businesses and states, we have the right, considering the importance of these ratings, to expect and to take steps to obtain an evaluation or rating which is objective and credible. I think that from this point of view, Mr Balčytis, you should not underestimate the role that ESMA will play.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would also say in response to Mr Szegedi that, regarding the level of the penalties, the specifications for ESMA in the text that you will be adopting go into detail on this, and that ESMA will apply these penalties in accordance with the proportionality principle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you in advance for your vote of support for this new stage, which will show – I repeat once more – that Europe is making concrete and objective progress, that it is learning the lessons of the crisis, thanks to the support and the impetus given by the Belgian Presidency, and thanks to the support of all the groups in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to come back to the fact that many good questions have been asked in this debate. Commissioner Barnier addressed them one by one. I would simply like to say to you that this modification, this amendment of the regulation, is a first step in granting the necessary supervisory powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority, and that, as has been said, other revisions of this regulation will take place shortly. I think that, on this issue, and on many other important issues raised today, this will truly be an opportunity to bring together the whole debate in the revision which the Commission is getting ready to propose to us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the same note, I would like to return for a few moments to the removal of the provisions on transparency of credit ratings and associated information, which Commissioner Barnier himself mentioned just now. I do not think that this in any way means that the European institutions do not support the idea of transparency of credit ratings – quite the contrary. However, at this stage, when a decision is being taken, the best solution was to coordinate ourselves in advance on the basis of developments on the international stage, in order not to affect the competitiveness of the European markets. For the moment, therefore, better solutions to this issue are still being researched, discussed and developed, and we think that the best political compromise is the one on which you will be voting tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I would like to repeat that this is an important step, as many of you have stressed, which will help to improve the stability of the financial markets and which will support the development of a more effective supervisory framework.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, after the comments that you have heard, you can draw two conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is that Parliament will overwhelmingly support this report tomorrow, which will show once again that Parliament, or a large majority of it, appreciates the actions on regulation and supervision that are being taken by the Commission and which have been strongly supported by the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second conclusion that we can draw is that I will not come to a conclusion today, but that a new debate will open up, on the basis of this consultation, of Mr Klinz’s own-initiative report, to examine all these difficult questions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, we cannot avoid the fact that in 2009, when we brought about the first regulation, we were already asking ourselves these questions. If we have not dealt with these questions, it is because we have not found an appropriate response. I hope, therefore, that, thanks to the thought that is being given to the matter with the submission of Mr Klinz’s report, the discussion about consultation which is taking place will this time enable us to provide responses to complete the regulation on rating agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, however, if you will allow me, I will repeat a phrase by the President of the Securities and Markets Authority, who said that, at the very least, it would be good if the financial markets detoxified themselves of the rating agencies to allow investors to gain a greater personal appreciation of situations and risks. I think that that would also be a guarantee.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As a result of underestimating the credit risk, credit rating agencies were one of the factors that triggered the global financial crisis. On the other hand, there is no real competition in the credit rating agency sector. This situation increases the danger of conflicts of interest and, by extension, of a lack of transparency and quality in terms of awarding ratings to the various financial instruments. On 1 January 2011, the regulation giving rise to the creation of the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into force. Its main power will be to supervise agencies of this kind. Introducing a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies at EU level is proving to be a necessity. I think that this new authority needs to exercise its mandate as soon as it is created. I would like to point out that the decision made by the United States to introduce tighter supervisory regulations has paved the way for global harmonisation.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Union has already implemented rules, which will come into force at the end of the year. The rules for credit rating agencies that wish to operate in the EU and thus obtain a licence include, among other things, the obligation to register themselves and to comply with specific transparency and ‘good behaviour’ rules. I do not believe that these rules are strict enough, and I welcome the further measure that we are discussing within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. These agencies currently have a great deal of power; they can plunge a State and/or even a system (downgrading countries and causing a chain reaction of fear on the world markets) into crisis with one of their ratings. Their work is important in terms of guaranteeing reliability and stability, but there are doubts as to the rules and the criteria on which their ratings are based. Mr Gauzès’s report, which proposes bringing credit rating agencies under the supervision of the European Securities and Markets Authority, is therefore along the right lines.</p>

    <intervention id="2-535" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joke Schauvliege" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, honourable members of Parliament, I am very pleased to be here today, in the European Parliament, once again, after the debate we had prior to Cancún and now that the climate conference has produced an outcome.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am also pleased to see a few familiar faces here again who were also present as a delegation in Cancún and who were given a mandate by the European Parliament to make a very useful and active contribution to the success of the conference. I think that this should definitely be highlighted and underlined.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The climate summit in Cancún has ultimately been a success. It was uncertain, right up to the very last day, whether we would reach an outcome, but, in the end, that outcome has been a positive one. This was necessary, both for our climate policy and for the continued existence of the multilateral process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the climate conference, we reached a decision which actually consisted of two parts: the first part could be considered to consist of a number of specific measures which could be applied quite rapidly, and the second part lays down a number of foundations intended to facilitate a global deal for the post-2012 period over the long term. Obviously, both of these elements were agreed in the framework of the 2 °C target, which was included as the starting point in the outcome of the climate conference.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When I speak about immediate implementation or a number of actions which could be undertaken immediately, then I am talking about adaptation, technology, combating deforestation and financing. Perhaps I could briefly highlight a number of things?</p>
      <p sl="nl">First and foremost, adaptation. We have adopted a framework and established a committee. In that way, we will be offering support for the most vulnerable areas.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, technology. Support will be provided for both mitigation and adaptation. There are two new structures being created: the Executive Technology Committee and The Centre and Network for Climate Technology. The idea is to further knowledge through research, dissemination and transfer of technologies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, the fight against deforestation. The national strategies and action plans of developing countries will form the basis of financing action in the fight against deforestation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the Green Climate Fund must ensure that USD 100 billion is made available to developing countries by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="nl">These are the specific achievements of Cancún. If we then look at the longer term and at the foundations which have been laid down, we should, of course, continue to work next year to bring about an international agreement after 2012. The mitigation measures of both developed and developing countries have now been included and embedded in the text, which is very important, because the outcome of Copenhagen has now also been officially included.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, there have been efforts to ensure greater transparency. The legal form in the longer term, in the post-2012 period, will not be determined until next year. Now, that will be a debate in its own right: are we heading towards a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and what are the emerging countries and the United States doing?</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is not an end, therefore, but a beginning, an important new step in the climate debate. I think that all of us – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – will have to continue to work hard together to ensure that we can take a major step forward next year and, hopefully, get a binding international agreement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In any case, I would like to thank Parliament once again for the efforts it made in Cancún.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-536" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Connie Hedegaard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think it is fair to say that we in the European Union went to Cancún with the fear that we risked getting nothing. Of course, we also went there with the very strong desire to ensure that this would not be the case and that we actually got a substantial and balanced package. As you all now know, that is what we got.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that the multilateral process is alive. More than that, it is relatively well and, as it could have been dead by now, that in itself is important. I think that all those who were there also felt relief when the final deal was done. It was as though the whole international community simply wanted this to happen and wanted to prove that of course we need multilateralism when we are fighting global challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think that it is important to say that what we achieved in Cancún was not just about saving the process. It was more than that, which is, of course, the essential thing. We wanted to save the process. We wanted to save the prospect of having a global deal and we wanted to ensure that we also got something substantial done in Cancún. We worked very hard, together with the Mexican Presidency. We worked very closely with them and gave them our full support from the very beginning. I must say that the Mexicans fully deserve all the credit they have been given; they have done excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="en">A year ago, we took the first steps in Copenhagen. I think that, if we had met two or three days after Copenhagen was over, few of us would have thought that, one year later, all the elements of the Copenhagen Accord would be included in a binding UN agreement. That is really good.</p>
      <p sl="en">But in Cancún, we also took new steps. We strengthened the international climate regime with new institutions and new funds. I would like to stress three things that were particularly important to the European Union in the end game – which was very much Friday, as some of those present will recall.</p>
      <p sl="en">We had three priorities which we wanted to be reflected in the result. We wanted recognition of the gap between the emission reduction pledges of the Copenhagen Accord now being anchored in the UN text and the challenge of keeping global warming below 2 °C. It was very important, to state the obvious, that we are not there yet. We also very much wanted to have increased transparency – through measuring, reporting and verification (MRV), and international consultation and analysis (ICA). Thirdly, we wanted the possibility of a future legal framework for the period beyond 2012 to be reflected in the text.</p>
      <p sl="en">On all three points, we made progress. For the first time, the 2 °C objective is acknowledged in a UN document, the pledges are anchored and the obvious has been stated, namely, that countries need to do more for the world to stay below the 2 °C rise. We also started a process to strengthen transparency and, as we said in Cancún, it is not enough just to say that you are in favour of increased transparency. What does that mean? It is very important that the text now contains several pages spelling out exactly what the political guidance for MRV and ICA would be.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is very important and I would like to add one further point. I think that it is not just of interest to the international climate negotiations that, for instance, a country like China has now accepted international consultation and analysis. I think that is also an important signal that reaches far beyond the climate negotiations. This was actually a very important and significant step forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we managed to keep open the discussion about the Kyoto Protocol and a future legal outcome. I think that, if we had not had the prospect of having a second commitment period, it is very likely that the process would have been dead by now.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said these positive things, I would like to echo what Joke Schauvliege has just said to the effect that this does not mean that we have a very easy year ahead of us. We have a long and challenging journey to make. We saw in Cancún how slow the process is. When you take steps together in the UN context, it is slow by definition, so no one should believe that the road to South Africa is going to be an easy one. The year ahead of us is a very challenging one. The only thing I would say at this stage is that Europe will do whatever we can to continue to play this very constructive role and to try to build bridges between different points of view, while bearing our own priorities very much in mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is very important now that everybody goes back home and starts to do things in their own nation, in their own region and in their own municipality. All must now take action, as we are doing in Europe. We have our 2020 target and we have also initiated the discussion about how we could eventually increase our ambitions in the short term. As you know, in the spring, the Commission will present a strategy for completing the transition to a low carbon economy by 2050. That strategy will also include a 2030 objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish with a word about the European Union in the climate change conference. I would like to highlight that we actually managed to speak with one voice. We were discussing earlier in this forum how important that is. The Commission, the Presidency and the 27 Member States ensured that the European Union played its part on the world stage. I am pleased to say that there was excellent cooperation between Minister Schauvliege and her team and my team from the Commission. I would like to thank Joke Schauvliege very much for her contribution towards this result.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last, but of course not least, I would very much like to thank the Parliament delegation. I think that they contributed a great deal towards conveying the message that Europe really was speaking with one voice. I would particularly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Jo Leinen. I think that it was crucial that, when members of the delegation were addressed and asked about the European position, they all tried to stick to the common denominator. I think that contributed a lot to the general impression that this time, Europe actually was speaking with one voice. Thank you very much for that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to endorse the congratulating of Commissioner Hedegaard. We have learnt a significant amount from the events of last year, particularly with regard to speaking with one voice. If we compare the situation now with Copenhagen, we can say that we went to Copenhagen with high expectations and we were very disappointed. We went to Cancún with lower expectations and we nevertheless managed to achieve something there. I am convinced that next year in Durban, we will actually achieve the result that we are all hoping for.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important that the UN process is now up and running and that in the European Union, we are aware that many paths lead to the same goal. Our common goal is to limit global warming to the celebrated 2 ºC. We have now managed for the first time to enshrine this in a UN document. However, even in Europe, we have come to realise that the famous binding agreement is not enough. We also need to recognise the efforts of other countries – and this, in particular, includes the large emitters like the United States and China.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, it is extremely important from a political point of view that we are united in our efforts, and we succeeded in demonstrating this in Cancún. However, it is also important that, as the developed world, we not only live up to our historic responsibility, we also need to do something, and, above all, we must find a successor regulation for the Kyoto Protocol. It is also just as important that the developing world recognises that efforts are also required by them. I believe that we succeeded very well in doing that, and we are on the right track here.</p>
      <p sl="de">The details have already been mentioned. For me, what seems to be particularly important is the fact that we have made definite progress, particularly in the fight against deforestation. The individual countries are called on to develop national strategies, and we will then see what they achieve. That part is very important for us, including from a political point of view.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a responsibility with regard to technology transfer. We need to take more of a leading role in this regard, but, overall, my assessment is a positive one and I would like to thank you once again, Commissioner, for your efforts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we would like to thank the Commission and the Council, Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Schauvliege, for the daily briefings that the European Parliament delegation received in Cancún. We can truly say that, in Cancún, the EU was not part of the problem but, in many cases, was part of the solution. That should please all of us. The positive mood must now be utilised to bring new momentum to climate policy in Europe and also to the European Union. I would just like to mention three points. It was absolutely right for Parliament, in its resolution, to call for us to raise our ambitions and achieve a reduction in CO2 of 30% by 2020, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will adopt decisions on this in the spring.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we have the Green Climate Fund. We proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this. The people who rejected this must now come up with alternatives – we can no longer beat about the bush.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we must do our homework. We must take the hot air out of the EU’s carbon footprint. My final point is this: This climate conference is done. Now let us look to the next one. The work must now be stepped up.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have absolutely no interest in football but occasionally I have seen pictures of a game, and I have looked at the manager and thought of the Commissioner. Two-one down and, despite her best efforts, her team faces relegation; then a goal is scored. I do not know who scores it – maybe the goalkeeper on the opposite side walks into the net carrying his own ball – but one way or another it is a draw; a vital point is secured and relegation is avoided. It is not a triumph, but it is not a defeat; and the manager lives to fight another day.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am told that, at Cancún, a great cheer went up when there was a resolution to the negotiations. I can understand the relief of delegates there of it not being a defeat, but it was hardly a triumph. Where is the mention of curbing the rise in temperatures by 2015? Where is the ambition to cut CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050? Where are the post-Kyoto commitments? Fudged and dodged and kicked into the long grass. But criticism is easy; what is being attempted has never been done before. It requires the governments of the world to join together in collective action; that, of course, is why the critics on the nationalist Right hate it so much.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every government in the world accepts the science and accepts that we are not doing enough to stop world temperatures rising by two degrees centigrade. Even China, this time, recognised that there are limits to national sovereignty and accepted that there should be international verification of its emissions because we are in this together: one race, one species on a single planet.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are some very difficult questions to be answered as we go forward. How do we move from here to make a post-Kyoto binding agreement that places requirements not just upon developed countries but also upon developing countries? How do we secure the funding? Really, how do we get the money that we promised for adaptation and forest protection? How do we persuade our own governments to raise our 2020 ambitions from 20% to 30% cuts in CO2 ? But maybe we have an answer to that. With China well on its way to reducing its carbon intensity by 45%, it is in our economic interest to make sure that we take these measures, or we are going to be left behind economically. Maybe now, thanks to our not being defeated at Cancún, we have the momentum – the sense that we are going forward again – to make the changes that are necessary.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, like Mr Leinen, I wanted to emphasise the remarkable work that Commissioner Hedegaard and her team carried out in Cancún.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, in a way, the success of Cancún means that we have to call a halt to the strategy of saying that, if the others take no action, we will take no action. The positive aspect of Cancún is that everyone must now engage with the machine of international negotiation, in particular, by strengthening their national or regional objectives. In terms of the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Europe now has to reach 30%. Reaching 30% is part of the objective of obtaining a decarbonised economy by 2050; 20% will not allow us to make this transition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in reaching 30%, we will also clearly be linking up now with the emerging economies: Brazil, China and South Africa. We know that these countries have some objectives which, up to a point, are currently superior to those of the European Union. We must therefore put a stop to inaction and the strategy of the status quo. The success of Cancún means that we must engage with the process of international negotiation in a much more constructive manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was not fortunate enough to be on the Parliament delegation in Cancún, but I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone who was involved. I was perhaps a bit of a cynic about whether these sorts of meetings could achieve anything but, whilst there have been many voices in the press complaining about a lack of detail, particularly – as Jo Leinen suggests – about lack of detail in the area of financing for the Green Fund and many other issues that have been left unspecified at this stage, I take the optimistic view that this gathering was not the time or the place for dealing with minute detail, but was the time to flesh out the global aspirations and talk a bit about strategy, and I think that has been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my group, the ECR, we believe in light-touch government. We believe that you will achieve more by encouragement, not by haranguing, and I believe that this is a step closer to that. I can do no better than to close with the words of my Prime Minister, David Cameron, when he said yesterday ‘The Cancún agreement is a very significant step forward in renewing the determination of the international community to tackle climate change through multilateral action’. I congratulate every one of my colleagues here who was involved in achieving that.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The main objective yet to be achieved is a global agreement which is legal and ambitious and aims to keep the temperature increase below 2 °C, or even 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial levels.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The measure of agreement reached in Cancún is a step in that direction. I agree with those who say today that we have a lot to do yet. The governments must build on that achievement now. The gaps must be filled. The difficult issues on the agenda must be tackled, and targets must be set now that are much firmer, clearer and binding. The deadlines between now and COP 17 in South Africa must be adhered to.</p>
      <p sl="ga">My thanks also, therefore, to the Council and the Commission for what we have achieved, but we still face hard work ahead. In Europe, we must agree immediately to a reduction of at least 30% in CO2 leakage in Europe, not only for the sake of international agreement but for our own sake.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much for her splendid contribution and the excellent briefings given to all of us in Cancún. However, the whole climate conference, of course, focused on dealing in hot air and the setting up of a fund for developing countries. This is fine from my point of view, but who will check that the money is being given out correctly and does not end up in the personal pockets of dictators? I would have very much liked to have seen the conference also discuss restricting the use of basic resources, the necessity of biodiversity for the natural regulation of the climate and population growth – a subject that all of the politicians of the world are shutting their eyes to, because in only a few years’ time, the planet will have to feed around 10 billion people. How will we obtain food for them without increasing our CO2 emissions, and without this tipping the natural balance and the global climate?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as carbon crooks and One World Government conspirators celebrate their advances at Cancún, UK Prime Minister Dave Cameron declared his satisfaction with the outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the end of the coldest first half of December in central England since records began in 1772, Dave is satisfied that the Green Climate Fund will cost British taxpayers GBP 2.9 billion on top of the GBP 18.3 billion a year that the Climate Change Act siphons from British consumers for the corporate crooks in the green industrial complex. Coincidently, GBP 2.9 billion is also the amount the Treasury will save by increasing the debts of British students, condemning them to a lifetime of bondage to the banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">That scam has already caused student riots. Taxpayer riots over far bigger scams – bail-outs to corrupt and incompetent banks, propping up the zombie euro and the global warming hoax – are yet to come, but come they will and, unlike Prince Charles and Camilla, their targets will deserve everything they get.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and the parliamentary delegation, led by our fellow Member Mr Leinen, on the work that they did in Cancún, a meeting that I was unfortunately unable to attend in the end.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that Cancún and its results can be viewed, along the lines of what my colleague, Mr Seeber, was saying, from the perspective of Copenhagen: Cancún viewed from the Copenhagen perspective. The first conclusion from this perspective is that there was a fundamental differentiating factor. In Copenhagen, the expectations were very high, and in Cancún the expectations were much more realistic, as a result of which the assessment of Copenhagen was very negative, while the assessment of Cancún, both by those who took part and by the media in general, was very positive. Cancún learned lessons from Copenhagen, and I think that is the first, very interesting, conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that measures have been taken and agreements reached which are not, of course, ground-breaking, but which could be very interesting from the point of view of efficiency. Among other things, I think that the creation of a committee and a technology network to promote technological cooperation is extremely important. Here, we are going to adopt a report during this sitting on energy efficiency, which is one of the fundamental keys to effectively combating climate change. Also, I think that matters such as the World Bank being more involved or official recognition of the actions of countries to reduce emissions returning to the procedure and framework of the United Nations are very positive.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to say that there is one year to go before we get to South Africa. It would be a very good idea if, in the same way that Cancún learnt from Copenhagen, we now learnt from Kyoto, and achieved an international frame of reference for an agreement against climate change that is more flexible, more transparent, more efficient and more integrative.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I do not think it is a conspiracy to say that we are one world sharing one planet and I think what I got out of Cancún was the reality of all those people working together. One of the best parts of being in Cancún was sitting on those buses going to and from the conference centre and listening to the delegates who would tell you about what they are doing: the Zambians working with the Russians working with the Japanese and the Chinese negotiator to get an agreement. We share one planet and we have no future unless we work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank the Council and the Commission for the work they did. Europe did speak with one voice and, from our meetings with different delegations, it was very clear that Europe’s leadership was appreciated and people were very aware that we had a 20% target but were thinking of moving to 30%. I wonder what the Commissioner thinks now of the prospects for being more ambitious before Durban because, from what we heard, I think that what Europe says in Durban will count.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with my fellow Members that the work done by Commissioner Hedegaard at the Climate Change Conference in Cancún is to be applauded. Cancún was a step forward, although, regrettably, a much smaller step that what is really needed. In any case, Cancún officially endorsed the emissions commitments made at Copenhagen. At the same time, it pointed out that they were not enough to keep climate change below two degrees and urged the industrialised countries to tighten up their emissions targets.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now, the EU leadership on climate change is, in practice, being tested: are we prepared to tighten up our emissions targets by moving from a 20% to a 30% decrease? This would be the best way to promote the achievement of something we must have in Durban next year: a comprehensive international climate agreement. After Cancún, the claim that the EU is somehow alone with its climate targets is clearly no longer relevant.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would also like to express my thanks for the work that has been done. It is a time for balance, certainly, but we all know that it is also time to make commitments, serious commitments: many important things have been said here, and the project specifications that we have in front of us are very long, enormously so. Important commitments came out of Cancún, but the truth is that none of these will be formalised before next year’s conference in South Africa. We have a year ahead of us and a lot of work to do, as I have already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to underline the fact that the rights of indigenous people and people most affected need to be integrated, as this is a commitment that must be raised and taken seriously. We must not allow the poor always to be the ones that pay more, because the environmental and climate crisis is a crisis of survival for all of us, and it is a matter that involves us all.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to ambition, I would also like to repeat what I have said before: we need to be more ambitious, like we used to be. With regard to cutting emissions, we need to achieve 30% again, with there being no reason for us not to meet this commitment, and the same for temperature and global warming. We can be more ambitious and take medium- and long-term measures. To do this, it is not just enough to say it: we have to demonstrate it, and now is the time, because in my opinion, we cannot take tiny steps along this path.</p>

      <p sl="en">Well, I suppose that is to be expected really because, while many of you were out there lecturing us on how we need to change our lifestyles to combat global warming, it was actually the coldest week that Mexican city had seen for over a hundred years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Back in the UK, we have also had the spectacle of scientists trying to suggest that one of the coldest Novembers we have seen in the last hundred years was actually caused by global warming. Do these people think we were born yesterday? This also explains why even more British people now believe that global warming is a scam and a way to raise taxes and exert control. But what have you actually achieved in Cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers’ money in the guise of the Green Climate Fund, which I suggest will end up being a lucky bag for African dictators to buy themselves more Mercedes Benzes and private jets?</p>
      <p sl="en">Personally, I think the name of the Green Climate Fund should be changed, and I think the ‘Politics of Envy Fund’ would be better and closer to the truth.</p>

Science is a slow process, evidence has to be studied and deciphered, but politics is a quicker game and politics is running ahead of the science; that is where the problem lies. The fact of the matter is that the globe is actually not warming; it has not warmed since 1998. So the game is up, people are finding out that you have a problem.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am slightly concerned about the turn the debate has taken at this point, because I believe that one of the best things about Cancún was the fact that we were able to debate and to reason without splitting into two camps – the doomsayers and the deniers – which was perhaps the worst outcome of the Copenhagen summit.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Copenhagen, all the main global players came together; thousands of non-governmental organisations came and demonstrated and, in the intense cold of Copenhagen, we managed to come home feeling overexcited and overheated, with the added disappointment of having failed.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Cancún – under the extremely capable chairmanship of Mexico, which I think everyone was able to single out and thank for its ability to manage such difficult negotiations, which had previously ended in stalemate – we saw, in fact, that the multilateral process is still alive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, I believe that we must not waste this new opportunity, created in Cancún, to be practical and to negotiate; we must not go back to being supporters at a football match, because we are actually talking about something serious here: we are talking about the future of our planet.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore like to cite the words of an Italian climatologist, who is also very well known abroad, to support my view. That climatologist is Franco Prodi, brother of the former Prime Minister Romano Prodi, and he calls for calm, common sense and no divisions, arguing a point that we should all agree on: he says that it will take us many years yet to know as much about climate change as we know today about meteorology. We must therefore help science to speed up its work and to be in a position to provide reliable policy-making forecasts as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the meantime, the environmental protection of the planet must be at the heart of any serious environmental policy. I therefore believe that we can continue to work practically on this issue, and I thank everyone for how the work in Cancún has been pursued.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the American writer Mark Twain once said ‘rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated’. Likewise, we could say that, fortunately, the rumours surrounding the UN climate process have been shown to be greatly exaggerated. The climate process is alive and well. The conference in Cancún showed that the UN can indeed deliver results. However, it is, of course, also clear that the major hurdle – the big question of how much to reduce CO2 by and when to do it in order to be able to keep the temperature rise below two degrees – is a question that still remains to be answered.</p>
      <p sl="da">There is hope, however, particularly if there is someone who will show leadership. We in the EU must show that leadership. We did so in Cancún, but we must also do so with regard to the reduction targets. We have now promised a reduction of 20% by 2020. Here in Parliament, we have also agreed that we believe we should go as far as 30%. When we met with delegations from other countries in Cancún, with NGOs and with the leaders of UN institutions, we emphasised very many times how important it was for us here in Parliament to have shown the way and how much we hoped that we, as a European community, would decide as quickly as possible to take on the commitment of the 30% reduction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency for their success in Cancún, because in Cancún, we were able to applaud the Copenhagen trauma away. I was also applauding this trauma away because now we can finally look ahead. We can look forward again and we can look at what we need to achieve in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be honest: the most sensitive issues – the second commitment period, Kyoto, financing, the mitigation targets – are still on the table. We have a crucial year in front of us ahead of Durban. Let us be clear. China and the US are still there and those two big blocs are still not moving ahead very quickly. That is what we need in Durban. So I have a very simple question for the Commissioner. What is the EU concretely going to do to make sure that we get other global partners like Brazil and India on board with the Europeans to strive for an ambitious deal in Durban? Speaking with one voice is very good, but now we have to get our proactive diplomacy in place.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, on Saturday morning, I woke up with a sense of relief after learning that both agreements had been adopted and that, of course, gives me confidence that global warming can still be kept below the 2 °C limit.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This has left a bitter aftertaste, however, because the actual process of negotiation in the international community is far too slow and we should have adopted such an agreement at least a year ago. Now we find ourselves under great time pressure, primarily because we still do not have any figures and because we still have no specific undertakings as to how individual countries are going to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p sl="sl">One positive thing, though, is that the document is comprehensive and that it actually covers all the priority areas which the European Union defined even before the negotiations had begun.</p>
      <p sl="sl">My assessment is that the European Union was successful in the negotiations and that it was also sufficiently ambitious, because it was ambitious enough to retain its leading role and promote the negotiations. If we were too ambitious now, we would be left by the wayside, as happened to us last year. I also think that we have learned a lot from what happened last year. I would like us to take this knowledge with us to the next round of negotiations next year and I would like us to avoid changing that strategy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This year, we face a very serious task, particularly in our dealings with third countries. On that score, I think that the European Union must exploit every possibility at its disposal to help the United States, so that next year, we can obtain a much more ambitious undertaking from them than has been the case this year.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We in the EU will have to focus, in particular, on implementing the legislation which we have adopted over the past few years, because there are many new things that we will actually have to start putting into practice. The European Union is still the only region in the world to have limited its emissions by law.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have already said here that, whereas expectations for Copenhagen were very high at the start, expectations for Cancún were not very ambitious. As a result, Copenhagen was considered a failure and Cancún was viewed as progress. However, there is another difference in favour of Cancún, which also resulted from the good work done by the Mexican Presidency, which did everything it could to make the conference a success.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union did the work within its remit, and contributed to the progress that was made. This included confirmation of the limit of two degrees centigrade, and the creation of a Green Fund for supporting adaptation in developing countries and the fight against deforestation. I would like to emphasise something else that I have already referred to here, which is the re-establishment of confidence in multilateralism and in the possibility of obtaining a binding international agreement on climate change, which needs to be next year in Durban, and we need to make an effort for this to be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to deal with one particular issue and that is reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, the so-called REDD programme, which is a very important issue, but I am concerned about a lack of policy coherence in the Commission in relation to this issue. For example, the Trade Commissioner is currently trying to do a deal with the Mercosur countries which will result in increased beef production in these countries. That can only come from land that will be deforested, which will add to the climate change problem.</p>

I congratulate everyone who contributed to this achievement. I have been following this process from Brussels and from Budapest, and it is an enormous accomplishment that there will be a chance in one year’s time in Durban to reach a comprehensive international agreement that will lay down mandatory commitments after strenuous work. It is an important step in the right direction that emerging economies such as China, Brazil and South Africa are committing themselves to the 2 °C target for the first time. Finally, I consider it very important that the European Union not only spoke with a single voice, but that it changed the attitude it had exhibited in Copenhagen, and treated the other countries as partners and with empathy, and this contributed considerably to the success of Cancún.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 16th climate change conference in Cancún ended this time, too, with a non-binding compromise called the ‘balanced package’.</p>
      <p sl="it">There was the birth of the Green Climate Fund, which will cost the most developed countries USD 100 billion a year as from 2020, while USD 30 billion will be immediately allocated to ‘fast-start’ funding, USD 410 million of which Italy will have to find.</p>
      <p sl="it">Meanwhile, no demands have been made of the most highly polluting countries; on the contrary, China alone has announced that it is going to double its energy production by 2020 and, therefore, since it has decided to stick with 80% carbon to 20% other energy sources, it will also double its emissions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We believe it is unacceptable to keep asking our companies to make sacrifices for companies in third countries.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the noticeably lower expectations that we saw before the Cancún conference should not justify excessively optimistic discussions with regard to its results, and it should be regarded as a success even less so. If there were any consistency to the analysis criteria, we would have to acknowledge that the results were, as expected, sparse.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Where is the replacement for the Kyoto Protocol that was absolutely necessary a year ago? Where are the targets for reduction in line with the timeframes proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change? The European Union itself remains outside these timeframes, the United States’ target is a 3-4% reduction compared to 1990 levels, which it took away from Copenhagen. Where is the serious discussion on the ineffectiveness and perversity of market instruments, such as the carbon market, of flexibility mechanisms like the clean development mechanism, of the hot air and other juggling tricks that serve more to open up good business prospects for a few people than to achieve reduction targets?</p>

Last year, we deplored the results of Copenhagen, or, to be more precise, the lack of results. Today, we are happy with Cancún, but my joy is still slightly reserved, simply because I would like more. It is clear that negotiating is a huge and complex task. It is a real challenge when there are so many different positions. However, what worries me most is the image of this issue in society. Really, society is not being won over. The difficulties faced in reaching an agreement, by which I mean achieving legally valid measures, is something that is important to us all but it is becoming a tiresome issue. I agree with the Member of the Commission that we must do our homework, we ourselves must achieve the target of 20% by various means. Of course, it is always easier to point the finger at those who are perhaps not doing something and to say that maybe we do not need to do it either. In spite of what you said – that we managed to achieve something – I would still like to ask whether you really would not have expected a somewhat greater result in Cancún?</p>

However, we have not solved the real problems: firstly, we need to give political expression to the Bali Declaration – in particular, with regard to what we in Parliament have already called climate justice – and we need to generalise and simplify the emissions trading system, because it is inconceivable to have a market mechanism where half of the emissions quota is given away free.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, can I first say thank you very much for the many kind comments, including those of Chris Davies, although I know even less than he about football so I could not follow the picture, but I guess it was a positive one!</p>
      <p sl="en">Several have asked about the 30%. How are we now stepping up, where is this process and, Linda McAvan said, what are the prospects? I think all of you here know what the process is now. We are now doing the analysis of individual Member States: what are the problems, what are the challenges, what are the co-benefits, what can we do? Then we will also have a discussion on the 2050 low carbon strategy that we will present by March – including, as I said, the 2030 target because, if we know where we are going to be by 2050, it is also very clear that there are some trade-offs involved. The less we have done by 2020, the more we have to do afterwards, and the more likely that it will be expensive.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the kind of discussion we are trying to get here in the spring, and I am pleased to see that more and more Member States have started to hold this discussion among themselves and also come forward with different signals on how they see this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Chris Davies asked about 2050 and the 50% and some other things that were not there. That was very much dealt with in a special group with some ministers discussing the shared vision. The Swedish Minister was one of the two ministers leading that group and I can say for sure that Europe was trying to push this very hard. You all know why it is difficult to achieve this, but that is one of the topics we still need to have on the table on our way forward to South Africa. It will have to be on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms del Castillo mentioned that Cancún has learned from Copenhagen. I would say yes, but mostly perhaps in the sense that people realised in the last 24 hours that if they did not show the will to compromise, there would be a real risk of not getting anything done, and the whole process would risk dying. That argument was not just a tactical thing, but was a real thing in the room where people knew that this would probably be the last chance for many of them to save the only process where everybody was sitting around the table. There was quite a lot of pressure there because of the experience in Copenhagen to show the necessary political will in Mexico.</p>
      <p sl="en">One could ask what exactly the EU is going to do to strive for a deal in Durban. I would say we will be doing the same as this year, where we have actually done a lot of outreach, a lot of proactive thinking, and also a lot of thinking about where the deal could be done. Those of you who were there also know that many of the texts and much of the input were also due to a lot of European experts and a lot of European contributions, and we should do exactly the same this coming year. We should also build on what has been achieved in the Cartagena process in which 25 countries – developing and developed countries alike – really want to move forward. We will continue that work. We gained a lot of benefit from having this process in Cancún, because we were coordinating a lot across different regional groups. That will be one of the first things: we will try to get people together in the Cartagena Group and work there with them, as well as working with a lot of others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there was the question about the treaty that should replace the Kyoto Protocol. It is not there yet because the world does not agree on it, but this is definitely not because of the European Union. I would re-state that, had it not been for the European Union signalling its willingness to taking a second commitment period, had we said the same as other Kyoto parties in Cancún, then any prospect of having a legally binding deal by now would have been dead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Ms Morkūnaitė was asking if we did not expect a bit more from Cancún, and I would say no, actually not. In the last hours there, I sat with a check list. Sometimes you should take care not to get carried away when you are taking part in something. You think that when you can get some things done, maybe you could also get other things done that you knew before you left home you would never get. When I sat with that check list, I must say that the list of elements we wanted to see in there was in there. Of course, there are always things that you do not get, but in truth we knew, for instance, that the second commitment period could not be for Cancún, so we just wanted to save the prospect of having it and continuing to build on what we have.</p>
      <p sl="en">An adaptation framework, a technology framework, a forestry framework, all the elements from the Copenhagen Accord, the prospect of still having a legally binding deal and some substantial progress on MRV/ICA and a number of other issues, plus the fact that we now have all parties subscribing to the view that we have not all delivered enough together – I think that if we had discussed that result as we did before we left for Cancún, most of you would probably have agreed that it would be a good outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">A final word. Now we have to think very carefully about the strategy for the way ahead. Many of us will need a break for Christmas and the New Year, but early next year, we should continue the very strong dialogue between Council, Commission and the European Parliament and come back to one another after we have done some reflecting and have digested the outcome of Cancún. As I said at the beginning, it is going to be a very difficult year, but we should build on the experiences we had here. If Europe sets a clear strategy, then we can actually move things in the right direction, and although that is not going to be less challenging for Durban, I am sure that we can do this. Maybe we just need a rest first and then come back to the dialogue in early 2011.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for making many positive comments about the agreement reached in Cancún.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You all know that Cancún is a pragmatic, but very important step in climate policy and the climate debate. You know that the principle that we should, eventually, reach a global, legally-binding agreement, was retained in the Council conclusions adopted last October. However, we were all aware that it would be impossible to secure a global deal in Mexico and that had also been determined in advance. For this reason, we opted for a number of balanced partial agreements. They are also there and, as the Commissioner has said, the points that we felt were important in order to achieve that balance on the European Union’s part have also emerged from the Cancún conference.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should also give the European Union credit for taking a very clear and transparent stance, a stance that has been incorporated in the Council conclusions and that was also defended with a single voice. Everyone from the Commission and the European Parliament made a very positive contribution to the promotion of this stance and, on the part of the Council, we did our utmost to ensure that we explained that stance as far as we could. Sometimes, it was really necessary to continue to emphasise that: what the content of those conclusions was and what the European Union’s intention behind that stance was.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We were building bridges; in Mexico, we also received many positive reactions to the fact that the European Union had taken the lead and that we had genuinely tried to bring several different positions closer to each other. We played that role well and I think that this was also clear to the whole world.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, it is true that we now have to take stock of one or two things, but that does not detract from the fact that we now have to proceed fairly rapidly. I can tell you that, as early as next Monday, we will be having an exchange of views in the Council about the outcome of Cancún. I also think that it is a good thing that, here in Parliament, we are already exchanging views on this issue. That said, it is true that we definitely need to develop a strategy and to do so as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Council has also decided to take up the debate about the 30% reduction in the spring. We have asked the Commission to carry out a second screening, so that we know what that 30% reduction would entail at Member State level, and the Council has agreed to reopen the debate in the spring.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By way of conclusion, I would like to thank everyone once again for your cooperation and, in particular, Commissioner Connie Hedegaard, for the very pleasant and constructive way in which she has worked with us, and for your efforts, which led to some excellent achievements in Cancún. This would not have been possible without constructive cooperation on everyone’s part and if the European Union had not been able to imprint such a clear hallmark on the agreement reached in Cancún. I therefore thank you very warmly for that.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Many view the outcome of the Cancún climate change conference, which ended last week, as a success, a breakthrough, the return of hope. I am, however, of the opinion that we cannot speak of success until a legally binding international agreement has been concluded as a continuation of the Kyoto Protocol, which will expire in 2012 – an agreement on which basis sanctions can be imposed. No decision has been reached about such an agreement in Cancún. In fact, some countries would rather have the Protocol itself abolished. The question of the usability after 2013 of the Kyoto quota surplus, which is of key importance to Hungary and considered to be a national asset, will thus remain unresolved until the climate change summit to be held in South Africa in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The possibility still exists that Eastern European countries will inequitably and unjustly be deprived of the reward they would have received for fulfilling their actual emission reduction commitments in the Kyoto system, while infringing parties will face no penalties whatsoever. Moreover, the USA and China, the biggest emitters, are still not parties to the Kyoto Protocol, and therefore, the results we will be able to achieve in halting global warming will remain minuscule. Hence, as long as we do not have a legally binding international agreement that is able to both punish the bad students and reward the good ones, we can by no means speak of success.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would congratulate the President of the Cancún conference on the transparent negotiations during such a complex process. Although it could have gone further, this agreement seems to be the best possible one at this time. The Kyoto Protocol could still be extended, which is positive: there will be a lot of pressure in Durban next year, given that the only binding agreement on climate change will be expiring, but it is very important that the agreement reached in Copenhagen now becomes an official United Nations document, as it is supported by all countries except Bolivia. I am glad that many of the socialist positions supported here in this House were introduced into the text, such as the creation of a ‘Global Green Fund’ to help developing countries adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. I also applaud all of the countries that agreed to maintain the proposal of 1.5 degrees, a more ambitious objective on the table for the next summit. This is a very important signal, and the next step will be to ensure that it is reflected in CO2 reduction targets.</p>

      <p sl="ro">After lengthy negotiations, the United Nations climate change conference in Cancún has reached a positive compromise. The outcome is no record achievement, but it is an important step towards combating climate change. Progress has been made in all the areas which appear for the first time in a UN document. I welcome the decisions made as they will facilitate the negotiations’ advancement in the period ahead and will ensure significant progress is made, particularly with regard to the elements aimed at the developing countries and the countries most exposed to the impact of climate change. Furthermore, I support the narrowing of the gap between developed countries and undeveloped regions by granting financial and technical assistance. I think that this summit marks a crucial juncture where our negotiators have paved the way for an agreement to be signed next year in Durban in South Africa. I wish to congratulate the European Parliament delegation for the efforts it made and the success achieved.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The outcome of the climate summit in Cancún could hardly be described as a great achievement. However, it is better than nothing. Some concrete steps have been taken, for example, in the fight against deforestation, and the go-ahead has been given for the establishment of a USD 100 billion climate fund. The whole thing, however, is moving at a terribly slow and tiring pace. It resembles nothing so much as the dancing procession of Echternach. Meanwhile, the global warming clock quietly ticks on.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What was Europe’s role in this story? The EU has certainly learned from the mistakes of last year’s Copenhagen conference. In Cancún, Europe was at the heart of the negotiations and acted as a united front. The entire world has its eyes on the EU model and looks on it with admiration, because we have the most progressive and binding agreements. Europe is a role model when it comes to climate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have to hold on firmly to that leading role over the coming years. It clearly marks us apart from almost all other continents, in a positive way. It is an enormous asset in terms of our image and, at the same time, it entails major economic and social benefits.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have been monitoring international climate negotiations for the last 15 years, and I am particularly happy with the agreements reached in Cancún. The decisions adopted represent real progress in negotiations. The main elements of the Copenhagen Agreement are now under the aegis of the UN. The United Nations has regained its credibility as a forum for drawing up multilateral climate agreements. Mexico organised a participative and transparent conference. The EU played a leading role. I would like to highlight the efficient management of tasks by the European Commission and the Belgian Presidency. There was significant progress with regard to technology, forests and adaptation. In particular, I welcome the creation of a Climate Fund. On the basis of the results of Cancún, hard work will be needed to make a success of the Durban conference in 2011.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The Cancún conference has been dubbed a success and that is the right choice of word, considering that nothing had been expected to come of it. Nevertheless, it is important for the EU that we state the facts: nothing has stirred in the matter of emissions cuts and there have been no pledges made to reduce them. We have no global agreement in sight and we have nothing to give us cause to tighten up the EU’s own, unilateral target to reduce them from 20% to 30%.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At Cancún, Parliament’s delegation met Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, who said, in all seriousness, that Europe has only benefited from the 20% target: it has apparently given us a boost and improved our competitiveness. That is why he supported the idea of making the target more stringent still.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would like now to call on all those companies involved in global business, and which believe that they are exposed to carbon leakage, to tell Achim Steiner and other similar influential leaders of organisations about the financial realities that you face. Show them the figures for the direct and indirect rise in costs due to emissions trading, if you disagree with the system.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is not right, as far as European citizens and workers are concerned, if our key decision makers, even the Commission, from which Steiner probably got his information, are living in a fantasy world where their feet do not touch the ground.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Cancún’s success lay in the fact that political pride was saved. It was agreed that there would be an agreement. We realise that the climate hype is abating and that climate change is becoming an ordinary, everyday issue. It is slipping out of the limelight and perhaps that is a good thing. Let us get back to a sensible, comprehensive policy of environmental protection.</p>

      <p sl="en">Women and men are exposed to health risks in different ways with, consequently, different health outcomes. Women live, on average, six years longer than men but most of these additional years are lived in worse health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certain diseases, such as osteoporosis, have a much higher incidence among women. This is why the EU strategy for Equality between Women and Men (2010-2015), which the Commission has recently adopted, points to the need for medical research and healthcare to reflect these differences. The strategy stresses that health services need to continue the process of adaptation to properly reflect the specific needs of women and men. The strategy for these actions, specifically targeting women’s health, includes awareness-raising seminars on women’s health and exchanging best practices on gender-specific health policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not starting from scratch here. The EU Health strategy, adopted three years ago, already signalled the need to take gender-related issues into account in health policy making. To this end, the Community health programme has supported many projects on women’s health aimed at promoting a better understanding and recognition of women’s health needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">A good example of how the EU can help Member States improve women’s health is cancer screening. It is estimated that 32 000 deaths from breast cancer alone could be prevented each year across the European Union if effective national screening programmes for breast cancer were implemented. This is why the Commission developed European guidelines on breast cancer screening.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I am pleased to say that earlier this year, the Commission published a report on women’s health, which contributes to raising awareness of the need for policies that are more responsive to gender concerns.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would also like to check something. Do we have sufficient data on the protection of women’s health in the Member States? Do we know the impact that this major economic and financial crisis, in particular, has had on women’s health? Should we not also examine the impact that poverty has on women’s health, in particular, that of elderly women? Are high quality health care services accessible to women living in poverty?</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission is trying to get as much information and feedback as possible and to set up a statistical base on all health issues. Naturally, our level of accuracy depends a lot on the response and feedback that we receive from the various Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree that we should continue to seek information and to see how health, especially the health of women, is affected by poverty. But health and poverty are interrelated; this is not gender based. In fact, we find that health is usually at risk in areas of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also taking action vis-à-vis the elderly. As you know, the Commission has now launched an initiative, namely the innovative partnerships. The first pilot project on this innovative partnership will be healthy and active ageing. I am sure that this will affect the health of our citizens of both genders.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At the moment, there are 120 million citizens in the European Union exposed to the risk of poverty. Women have obviously been hit very hard by the economic crisis and are more exposed to the risk of poverty, especially in the case of single-parent families.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Healthcare systems are suffering a great deal due to the economic crisis. Budgets have been cut and large institutions in this sector have even been closed. I would like to ask you what measures you have in mind for us to ensure that the measures for the early screening of cervical or breast cancer will be available to all women, regardless of their social or material situation, and especially to ensure that we will have a fair healthcare system, offering good quality services throughout the entire European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Again, we repeat here that healthcare and health delivery are a competence of the Member States. The Commission has, in fact, issued its guidelines on breast screening and we have been pushing Member States to abide by these guidelines and introduce breast-screening programmes into their countries as fast as possible. I can say that in most countries, we do have adequate – and very good – breast-screening programmes which are bearing results; other countries, unfortunately, are still a little slow. I can assure you that, in all the contacts that we have with the Member States, this is one of the priority areas that we discuss.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 16 by Tiziano Motti (H-0587/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: European Parliament declaration of 23 June 2010 on setting up a European early warning system (EWS) for paedophiles and sex offenders</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 23 June 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution ‘setting up a European early warning system (EWS) for paedophiles and sex offenders’. The Commission had already, on 22 May 2007, published a communication entitled ‘Towards a general policy on the fight against cyber crime’. Parliament called on the Council and the Commission to act on the Commission communication of May 2007 and also to implement Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks, and to extend its scope with a view to setting rules on preservation of the data of anyone who has uploaded Internet content, so as to enable the police and judiciary to tackle online child pornography and sex offending rapidly and effectively. Would the Commission please outline the action taken on this resolution?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-581" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I am strongly committed to the fight against child abuse and, specifically, child sexual abuse. On 29 March 2010, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on child sexual abuse and exploitation and child pornography. This ambitious text covers prosecution of offenders, protection of victims and prevention of offences.</p>
      <p sl="en">To take account of risks brought about by technological developments, the proposal introduces, in particular, new criminal offences such as grooming, viewing child pornography without downloading files, online sexual abuse or advertising the possibility to abuse children, for example, through Internet forums. Special investigative tools should be made available, such as undercover operations for the police to infiltrate sex offender circles, and special investigative units should analyse child pornography material to identify child victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States should also put in place national systems to block access to Internet pages containing child pornography and undertake actions to remove the content at source. We have looked carefully at the European Parliament declaration of 23 June 2010, and I would be interested to know about the honourable Member’s proposal for an early warning system. I have also taken note of the proposal to extend the scope of the Data Retention Directive in order to retain data about searches made by users for child pornography material and child sex abuse content uploaded on the Internet or messages used to groom children online.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Data Retention Directive obliges communication and network service providers to retain traffic and location data and data about subscribers. It does not extend to information about content. Content can be obtained and stored in the context of criminal investigations by means of the instrument known as lawful interception. Lawful interception is solely governed by national law and differs across Member States, but in general, it can be used only if a law enforcement authority has indications that a specific criminal activity is being committed and requires further investigation. This investigative tool lies outside of the scope of the Data Retention Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lawful interception occurs in the context of a criminal investigation which supposes the existence of a suspect. The Data Retention Directive, on the contrary, obliges operators to retain certain categories of data irrespective of whether the data holders are suspect or not. Extending the Data Retention Directive to huge volumes of personal and content-related data such as Internet searches for different key words in different languages, content uploaded, messages exchanged and the elements necessary to identify all users would have to withstand a necessity and proportionality case which has not yet been made. Such an extension would apply to content uploaded by everyone on every platform, at any given time and on every topic.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal put forward by the honourable Member raises serious concerns about its compliance with the principle of proportionality, even if its purpose is legitimate and deserves our full attention. The Commission believes that its recent proposal for a directive would be a more suitable instrument to achieve our common objective of protecting children from child sex offenders.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like the floor for just a few seconds because I am satisfied with the response and I am grateful to the Commissioner for it. I am glad that work is also being done to tackle the problem at its root.</p>
      <p sl="it">With reference to the declaration adopted on 23 June 2010, I would just like to point out that specific reference was made to uploaded data, not to the downloading of material from websites. This is because we believe, in fact, that the right to privacy of search engine users should also be duly taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, I think that more can be done – that much more can still be done – because if, on the subject of the proportionality principle, citizens have no qualms in submitting to searches before boarding a flight, since they are aware of the superior privacy protection afforded to passengers at the time of the search, there is also every chance of a satisfactory compromise being reached to protect minors in this area, too.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to return to the statement that Parliament adopted on 23 June 2010. You will recall that the statement refers mainly to the creation of a fast and effective warning system against paedophiles. My question in relation to this concerns another issue – should individual police forces not create databases of convicted paedophiles, under the aegis of the European Union, since the police forces of other Member States could make use of these databases created in each individual Member State?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, Poland recently introduced pharmaceutical castration for paedophiles and rapists, using hormone treatment to repress their sexual appetite, following the arrest of a forty-five year old man who had had two children by his underage daughter. This measure, as you can image, has provoked intense debate and reaction in Poland as to whose rights take precedence: the rights of society, which expects to be protected from rapists, or the rights of people convicted of sexual crimes, who may be subject to a punishment that many consider inhumane. Has the Commission taken a position on these issues and on the legalisation of chemical castration for sexual crimes?</p>

      <p sl="en">As I said at the beginning of my speech, one of the best tools for fighting child pornography and child sex abuse is the swift adoption of the Commission proposal of March 2010, the one against child sex abuse.</p>

I count also on the Member States and the European Parliament to have a final text that will be essential to fight these crimes and I would like to draw your attention again to the principle of proportionality, which I think connects with the latest question on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Over the last two years, the number of young unemployed people in the European Union has increased by one million. There are now five million young people under the age of 25 who cannot find a job.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is keenly aware of the difficulties facing young people on the job market today. Too many are on short-term contracts which offer slim opportunities for improvement, however well qualified the individuals might be. What is more, some groups have special difficulty in accessing jobs and staying in the labour market. They include young people from migrant backgrounds and those from ethnic minorities like the Roma.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, demand for highly qualified people is projected to rise by almost 16 million and demand for people with medium-level qualifications by more than 3.5 million. This represents a big employment opportunity for young people and we must make sure that young people can take full advantage of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Europe 2020 strategy, which lays out the EU’s detailed plans for growth and jobs for the next decade, lays special emphasis on young people and sets clear targets for educational attainment. In September, the Commission presented a set of policy initiatives for young people called ‘Youth on the Move’. It sets out an agenda for improving education and employment for our young people over the next decade. The Commission recently presented another flagship initiative, an ‘Agenda for new skills and jobs’. The Commission encourages the introduction of a youth guarantee to ensure that all young people are in a job, further education or activation measures within four months of leaving school.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another point is the need to reduce labour market segmentation in line with the common flexicurity policies. We propose that Member States with segmented labour markets should consider introducing open-ended contracts with a sufficiently long probation period and a gradual increase in protection rights. We also need to foster greater labour mobility and encourage innovation. Two instruments that will help here are the EU job mobility scheme – ‘Your first EURES job’ – and the European Vacancy Monitor. Your first EURES job will promote youth labour mobility and the European Vacancy Monitor will allow young people and job counsellors to see where there are jobs across the Union and what skills are needed. Meanwhile, the European Progress Microfinance Facility will provide support for young entrepreneurs who cannot find alternative funding to set up businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, there is no single solution to the problems facing us, but we can learn a lot from each other by exchanging experience. The Youth Employment Framework we propose gives guidance on how policy makers, stakeholders and institutions can help things along. Public employment services, the social partners, employers and support services for young people at local level all have a crucial role to play. We will work to encourage more exchanges of experience and good practice among them at EU level. I firmly believe that, by pooling resources at EU level, we can help develop and promote successful policies to support young people.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied with the Commissioner’s answer. In view of the global economic situation and the crisis, which has made conditions on the labour market much worse, affecting the most vulnerable group, namely young people, I would ask the Commissioner to give his verdict on the need for more emphasis to be given to European instruments such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which we need in order to retrain workers made redundant for reasons associated with the economic crisis and, hence, also as a result of globalisation.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to your reply to my honourable friend’s question, but I should like to bring your attention to the following, to what is happening on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="el">The figures for the unemployed in Greece in 2009 were 20% for young unemployed men and 34% for young unemployed women. This situation got worse after the International Monetary Fund had become involved. At the same time, two programmes funded by the European Union through the National Strategic Reference Framework have take-up rates of 1.9 and 3.2.</p>
      <p sl="el">So the question is this: why this low take-up rate in Greece? Is the Greek Government to blame? And secondly, is the Commission considering any additional measures to address this employment problem?</p>

      <p sl="en">Briefly, this is a very important, if sad, topic. I know that in my own country, 20% of young people are unemployed and emigration, which had finished, is starting again with what they call ‘the brain drain’ including, among others, members of my own family.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, following on from the last question, are some countries more receptive than others to the measures being proposed by the European Union, and what are the barriers being put in their place?</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to thank you for the comments and for drawing attention to other funds apart from those I already mentioned: the Microfinance Facility, the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. They can also play a role, the latter especially in cases of unexpected mass redundancies which particularly affect people in manufacturing industry, but can affect other industries as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We certainly believe that these funds are helpful and we believe they need secure funding for the next financial period or the next programming period, because unfortunately, even if prosperity is coming, we will have to anticipate significant redundancies in certain cases due to restructuring and cross-border relocations. We have to be attentive to specific cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is now an emerging divide within the European Union – a kind of dualism – with a core region where there is already GDP and job growth, but also countries like Greece and Ireland that continue to struggle under the pressure of the financial market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recently held personal negotiations with Minister Katseli in which we discussed how the European Social Fund could be used more effectively in Greece. There have been several reasons in the recent past, including the crisis itself, difficulties in cofinancing and certain administrative difficulties that made it difficult to draw from the Social Fund in a robust way, but I can assure you that my services are working very hard and very closely with the Greek managing authority to find appropriate funding opportunities from the ESF in this period. I believe it really helps if we manage to fund in the appropriate way.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that in emergency situations, it is even more difficult and there is a need and also the room to restructure available ESF funding. For the longer term, I think we have to tailor the Social Fund in a way that can be more effective in specific situations and in counterbalancing the impact of uneven economic development inside the Union, which has already manifested itself in terms of demography as well, triggering migration flows that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in the previous period. We will pay attention to this and connect that with labour market trends.</p>

      <p sl="en">This is one of my favourite topics, by the way, which is why I am going to consider all legislative and non-legislative measures to redress the persistent inequalities in decision making. The latest figures are not very positive, which is why we really need to do something – most of all because the figures persistently remain at the same non-positive level.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one of the five priorities of the Commission strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015, which I have already presented in this House, and I have also already announced that it would be good to have more women on boards and in management. That is why we need to speak with those who have responsibility. I will invite the leaders of the big listed companies to sit around a table in March to promote a dialogue with stakeholders in the business sector to get things moving. If things do not move, I will move to have targeted initiatives to improve the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the question of data collection and the dissemination of comparable data, we know perfectly well that there is also a deficiency here. We do now have the gender equality agency in Vilnius, so we can start to rely on more serious data, comparable data and, in particular, a database on women and men in decision making, and regular reporting.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that the lack of a high quality care infrastructure is one of the reasons, but not the only one, why so few women are in decision-making posts, so we will have a look at the Member States’ performance here. Over the period 2007-2013, half a billion euro will be available from the Structural Funds to develop childcare facilities and another EUR 2.4 billion to fund measures to facilitate women’s access to employment and to reconcile work and family, including access to childcare.</p>
      <p sl="en">When you hear me saying this, you will understand that I am not very impressed by what many Member Sates are doing at the level of childcare, so this is also high on the political agenda. My colleague, Mr Andor, looks at these figures and actions in the Europe 2020 strategy, and I really am convinced that Member States should step up their efforts in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response and, above all, for your commitment. I knew that this was one of your favourite subjects. In particular, I would stress the need to encourage a balance between working life and private life, for men as well as for women; it is only in this way that we will reach absolute equality. More than half of the Member States have not attained the objective of creating childcare facilities for at least 90% of children between three years of age and school age and for 33% of children under three years of age. I therefore wanted to ask you if you are intending to take retaliatory measures, or even to penalise the Member States that do not attain this objective.</p>

Children are children for a very short space of time and women can contribute at all age levels. So please do not just focus on children as a problem. The problem is not children – in fact, what is a problem is that we need more children in the European Union. The problem is: how do women break through the glass ceiling that the questioner has recognised?</p>

      <p sl="en">I fully agree with the analysis that many Member States are missing the Barcelona targets. Only eight Member States meet the Barcelona targets for children aged 0 to 3 years and only seven Member States meet the targets for children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Commissioner responsible for equality, I am not responsible for social affairs and I know that all these questions are on the agenda for the Europe 2020 strategy. We will certainly have to look at all these questions because the problems are going to become worse with the ageing population. Who is going to care for the elderly, too? Women are going to have not only the babies to look after, but also the elderly. So we really have to have a look at that and also analyse why the Member States are not taking up the money which is available in order to have more childcare facilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning quotas, in my answer I did not, I think, use the word quotas, but I have said very clearly that if there is no progress, then I will do something and I have said clearly what I mean by progress. Progress means having on the boards of publicly listed companies 30% women by 2015 and 40% by 2020. I hope that we can reach those targets without the need for strong intervention at European level. If not, well, quotas are on the agenda and, while there are those who may not believe that I will do what I say, I am known for normally doing things which I have announced. That is also why businesses now have a big chance to make it unnecessary for me to intervene, because if they do things right, we do not need to intervene.</p>
      <p sl="en">I completely agree with the figures which have been quoted. We women make up 60% of new university graduates; that means we should also somehow hold 60% of the management positions, but we are far from reaching that level. That is the reason why we need to help women to get into management positions. There are many reasons why they do not make it: one is culture and that is the most difficult to change. That is also the reason why women in decision making is one of the priorities of the Gender Equality strategy, just as is the gender pay gap – 17% on average at the European level, some countries being very high, some being very low.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next year, we are going to start a campaign to raise awareness of these facts. For instance, there is a very nice project in Germany which we could generalise to other countries where, in public spaces, there is a meter measuring how much longer a woman has to work in order to reach the same medium salary as a man. Of course, we also have to get the social partners into this discussion and we have to have transparency measures implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this is on the agenda of the strategy for women and we are going to put that in place step by step – not in order to just speak about it, but to change things.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 19 by Georgios Papanikolaou (H-0572/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Costs for Member States arising from interpretation, translation and information rights in criminal proceedings</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The regulation on interpretation and translation rights recently adopted by the Council and on the information rights of defendants which is currently being examined are two basic measures of the road map proposed by the Commission to strengthen defendants’ rights of defence.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Will the Commission say:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given that it is foreseen, inter alia, that Member States shall bear the entire translation, interpretation and information costs, what are the expected financial impact on and financial burden for Member States arising from the provision of such services? Member States, such as Greece and Malta, receive large numbers of illegal migrants and are expected to face particularly heavy costs from the provision of translation, interpretation and information services relating to criminal charges and the training of police officers and prosecutors.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Is the Commission expected to contribute to help these countries and provide them with financial assistance so that they do not have to bear the entire cost of providing these services to illegal migrants involved in legal proceedings? If so, which criteria will be used to fix the level of such aid and determine which countries will be eligible?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-601" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">When I became Commissioner, I saw that a great deal had been done in the past on questions of security and very little had been done on questions of rights. That is why, having the tools of the Lisbon Treaty at my disposal and also having the Stockholm Strategy, where many points on how we have to advance have been put into place, we decided to act, and we acted very swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, let me thank the Parliament for the excellent work which has been done on the procedural rights. We have already come to an agreement on the right of a person before the court to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. We are making good progress on the directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings: the famous letter of rights. If we want to become the continent of rights, we will have to have the procedural rights established little by little. Those come at a price but they are indispensable to safeguarding the rights of the defence for European citizens and also to making mutual recognition function properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before we make any proposal, we always make a thorough impact assessment of the financial consequences of the EU legislation for Member States. Only then do we submit legislative proposals. This exercise was, of course, based on the figures provided by the administration of the Member States. These figures reveal that the additional costs to be borne by Member States should not be too great.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the right to interpretation and translation, the directive simply reiterates an existing obligation of the Member States already in the Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe, so it is not asking for something extraordinary. It is just asking for something very basic. The Member States – and there are many who already comply with the Strasbourg Court obligations – are unlikely to have to incur any expenses in addition to what they already spend on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the right to information, the biggest share of expenditure will be in the initial one-off cost of drawing up a letter of rights. Here, the Commission has already submitted a model as an annex to the directive in all the EU languages. Member States just have to take this model and copy it, so the cost to them will not be very great. The Commission does not have a budget containing any appropriation which would allow the institution to provide financial assistance to Member States to meet those expenses. If Member States make a calculation taking in the risk of a miscarriage of justice, the legal remedies and the retrials, the loss of reputation of a justice system as a whole and sometimes the damages awarded by the Strasbourg Court or by domestic courts, then it is much more expensive not to have these basic rights financed by a responsible state.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply. You are absolutely right in what you say and I cannot but agree with you.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I would clarify and ask once again: for countries such as Greece or Malta, for example, where you know how much pressure we are under both from illegal immigrants and from people who may need help in criminal proceedings, if, in addition to the standard letter and various standard documents at their disposal, defendants need any of the documents in their case file translated which, as you know, is a specialist job which differs from case to case, do we estimate what the cost will be, especially for some small countries under such huge pressure and with such massive problems?</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the Commissioner for her answer as well. Like my previous colleague, I think one of the biggest difficulties that should be recognised is that – whilst we all understand the importance of access to justice in a format which is understandable to the person seeking the justice – these new rules cannot be used as a legal mechanism to delay further hearing of important cases, whether it is for deportation under immigration rules or whether it is to challenge certain criminal records and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is there any piece within the legislation or the proposal that would allow for the court to ignore the necessity for every single document to be translated into the language?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-604" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I can only repeat that the cost of an improper functioning of justice, or the cost of not treating human beings as human beings should be treated in a Europe of rights, is much higher than the cost of investing in those basic rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, it is much more difficult for countries which are very much below the minimum threshold to reach that threshold, and it will be much easier for countries which already have a certain level of rights to do so. Is that a reason for not acting? On the contrary. We have been analysing the possible costs for the different Member States on the basis also of the pressure under which they are operating. It is not a question of asylum alone. It is also a question of criminal proceedings, for example, in the case of an illegal immigrant charged with a criminal offence being brought before a court. We have not made it compulsory to have all the documents translated, only those which are essential to enable the person being prosecuted to understand what is happening to him or to her.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, the great majority of people affected will not be illegal immigrants. The largest groups affected are people travelling to another Member State, such as tourists for instance, or people who live in another Member State but who do not speak the language of that country. So this will provide a basic benefit for millions of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Imagine that you are travelling from Strasbourg to a neighbouring country. You are involved in a traffic accident. You have injured someone. You are taken to the police, you are taken to court and you have no idea what you are being accused of. In those circumstances, you would be very glad at least to know what you were charged with so that you could try to defend yourself. I think that is a basic human right and we should consider the cost to society of not putting this basic human right into practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Helsinki European Council of December 1999 granted Turkey the status of candidate country and accession negotiations with Turkey were opened in October 2005. The Commission has reported regularly to the Council and Parliament on Turkish progress towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 9 November, the Commission published the 2010 progress report on Turkey. The report covers the period from early October 2009 to October 2010 and progress is measured on the basis of decisions taken, legislation adopted and measures implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turkey has pursued its political reform process, in particular, through the reform of its constitution, and continues to sufficiently fulfil the political criteria. The constitutional amendments adopted by referendum on 12 September created the conditions for progress in a number of areas such as the judiciary, fundamental rights and public administration.</p>
      <p sl="en">The implementation of the constitutional changes in a transparent and inclusive way is essential for Turkish progress. The democratic opening aimed notably at addressing the Kurdish issue has not yet met expectations. The decision of the constitutional court to close down the Democratic Society Party and a surge in PKK terrorist attacks also undermined this policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Significant reforms are still required on fundamental rights, in particular, in the area of freedom of expression. The high number of legal suits against journalists and undue pressure on the media undermine freedom of the press in practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to regional issues and international obligations, it is now urgent that Turkey fulfils its obligation of full non-discriminatory implementation of additional protocols to the association agreement. The Commission has recommended that, if there is no progress on this issue, the measures adopted by the European Union in 2006 should be upheld. This will affect the overall progress of the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turkey has continued to express public support for the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. However, there has been no progress towards normalisation of bilateral relations with the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the economic criteria for accession to the European Union, Turkey continues to be a functioning market economy that can cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Turkey has witnessed strong economic growth in 2010, recouping the losses incurred during the financial crisis, but the process of privatisation and structural reform needs to continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turkey continued improving its ability to take on the obligations of membership by aligning its laws and regulations with those of the European Union. Two negotiating chapters were opened during this reporting period – environment and food safety – adding to a total of 13 chapters that are currently open. Important progress has been made on energy security with the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement on Nabucco, and on cooperation in the aviation sector with initialisation of the EU-Turkey horizontal aviation agreement. Much alignment remains to be done, particularly on fisheries, social policies, justice and home affairs, and the customs union where longstanding trade issues remain unresolved.</p>
      <p sl="en">It remains crucial that Turkey improves its administrative capacity to implement and enforce EU-related legislation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Regarding the first question, I definitely belong to those who are not satisfied with the pace of our accession negotiations. I do not think it reflects the importance of the country, and the commitment on both sides, to open just one chapter per Presidency, bearing in mind that we were unable to open a new chapter during this Presidency even though there has been a lot of progress, in particular, on Chapter 8 dealing with competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a number of reasons for this. Unresolved issues concerning Cyprus still being divided is one of them. The number of chapters available for us to open through the framework of the accession negotiations is indeed limited. We have only three chapters to open in the time remaining – on competition, procurement and social policy – and these are not easy chapters. Eight of them are being frozen, based on Commission recommendations, as a reaction to Turkey’s non-implementation of the additional protocol, but there are other chapters which are being blocked by individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In these circumstances, it is difficult for the Commission to provide any reasonable timetable. I can say that today in Brussels, in the framework of the General First Council at ministerial level, we had a good discussion on the EU-Turkey relationship and the accession negotiations in terms of agreeing on the text of declarations. I am also pursuing a number of routes for intensifying this process. I am confident that after the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Turkey, both sides will indeed be ready to do exactly that.</p>
      <p sl="en">On freedom of the press, this is an issue of concern and one that the Commission is following very closely. The goal of this exercise is to go through all the 35 chapters, through all the opening and closing benchmarks, to make sure that Turkey not only aligns itself with the European Union acquis but also provides a track record of the implementation of that acquis. This very much concerns the political part of the Copenhagen criteria, which specifically relates to freedom of the media and the freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="en">Together with the Member States and with the support of the European Parliament, we are very keen that the enlargement process is not just an exercise in ticking boxes, which might later cause problems with the implementation of some of the legislation or with the working of the institutions. It is a serious process where the track record is playing a more and more important role. This is exactly the process Turkey needs to go through before the question of whether it will succeed in becoming a member of the European Union is put on the table. That would be the best assurance that all freedoms, including the one mentioned by the honourable Member, are guaranteed.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 24 by Bernd Posselt (H-0569/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Cooperation between Vojvodina and eastern Croatia</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission view the potential for greater cross-border cooperation between the Serbian province of Vojvodina and eastern Croatia (Osijek/Eastern Slavonia region), with particular regard to the development of cross-border infrastructure such as the project to construct a motorway from Sombor to Osijek?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question 26 by Georgios Koumoutsakos (H-0581/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: The rise of an increasingly virulent form of nationalism in Albania and its prospects of EU accession</p>
      <p sl="unknown">For a very long time, the main feature of political life in Albania has been the extreme fragility of its government. This instability is having an adverse effect on the process of far-reaching institutional reform needed if it is to join the EU. Amid this climate of prolonged political uncertainty, one cause for special concern is the rise of a particularly virulent form of fanatical nationalism, both in the media and in society, especially among young people. To give specific examples of this: the murder of an Albanian citizen of Greek origin in Himarë last August; acts of vandalism at Bobostiticë cemetery in which wreaths laid as a mark of respect were burned; and the repeated, intemperate verbal attacks by part of the ‘mainstream’ Albanian press directed at the head of the Orthodox Church of Albania. In view of the above, will the Commission say:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Is it aware of the specific events outlined above? Is it concerned about the rise in fanatical nationalism? Will it make appropriate representations to the Albanian Government to tackle this problem? And finally, will all this alter the progress of Albania’s bid to join the EU?</p>

      <p sl="en">I will provide succinct answers to both questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main objective of the cross-border cooperation programmes is to support the development of a common socio-economic environment for people, communities and economies, including the delivery of technical assistance. This should prepare countries to manage future cross-border programmes under the European territorial cooperation objectives of the European Union Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cross-border cooperation programmes between the Western Balkan countries also aim at overcoming the legacy of the past conflicts. Cross-border programmes under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance within the Western Balkans started in 2007. The results have so far been very positive. In the framework of their cross-border programmes, both Croatia and Serbia showed readiness to cooperate in the areas lying on either side of the Danube River. The annual allocation for the Croatia-Serbia cross-border programme amounts to EUR 1.8 million. This allocation of funds is used for providing grants to small joint projects proposed by local stakeholders in a variety of sectors such as the economy, culture, tourism, the environment and social issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Project beneficiaries include municipalities, NGOs, chambers of commerce or cultural institutions. Large cross-border infrastructure projects, such as the project referred to in the question, are neither within the scope nor the objectives of the cross-border cooperation component of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. The Commission might consider funding such projects under component one for Serbia – which is institution building – and component three for Croatia – which falls under regional development – if the respective authorities in Croatia and Serbia so request.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the second question, if I may continue. As mentioned in the written reply to a previous question by the honourable Member numbered E-6800/2010 , the European Commission is aware of the deplorable incident in Himarë and is closely following developments. The alleged perpetrator has turned himself in to the police and is awaiting trial. The Albanian authorities bear the full responsibility for the efficient investigation of the facts and the equitable trial of those responsible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will be monitoring the processing of this case in conformity with the principles of human rights and the rule of law. In this question, the honourable Member also provides details of other incidents. Albania and Greece are closely linked by history. It is very much in the interests of both countries that they continue their cooperation and overcome any nationalist and extremist ideas which have been at the root of much misfortune suffered by the whole region in the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has repeatedly stressed the need for a strict enforcement of the rule of law and for full respect of human rights, notably the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities. All applicant countries are aware of the importance of fulfilling these criteria for progress towards the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its recent opinion the Commission commented positively on inter-ethnic relations in Albania. However, efforts are still needed to enforce respect for and protection of minorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">To the first question, the answer is yes, based on the request, for both of these countries. I am ready to look at it and see what the Commission can do to help.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, any nationalist race is a concern for the Commission and is an issue which needs to be treated very seriously within the framework of our relations with the country. As you know, at the beginning of October, we presented an opinion on Albania. There have been a number of the so-called key priorities – 12 of them – which are preconditions Albania must meet before we can recommend opening accession negotiations. Within these 12 key priorities, my colleagues and I will make sure that the issue you have raised is tackled satisfactorily and that the Commission makes no recommendation to start the accession talks unless questions, such as the one you raised, are dealt with satisfactorily.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the third question, I hesitate as to how to answer it briefly. I think we have seen some limited progress in this pre-election process. We are very keen to see the report of the OSCE/ODIHR monitoring mission. Based on that, we are ready to take further steps on engaging Belarus, but that will be an engagement across the board, having very much in mind the steps which are to be made by the Belarusian authorities on the core issues of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mr Bendt Bendtsen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan (2010/2107(INI)) (A7-0331/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-627" speaker_id="96705" name="Bendt BENDTSEN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Denmark" birth_date="25-03-1954" birth_place="Odense" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="DK">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, the EU’s target of achieving 20% energy efficiency savings by 2020 could be at risk of becoming yet another Lisbon prophecy. With the current initiatives, it looks like we will achieve 10 or 11%. That is not good enough. We must invest in energy efficiency for economic, commercial, environmental and social reasons. A greater focus on energy efficiency will mean, first and foremost, that we use less energy. This will result in savings and, according to the Commission’s figures, the financial benefits of achieving our 20% target are in the region of EUR 1 000 per household per year.</p>
      <p sl="da">While China and the United States are now making significant investments in this area, things are moving more slowly in Europe. We are trailing behind. In China, the state subsidises these industries. The United States has fantastic framework conditions for business, whereas European citizens only think about how much luxury we will get for our monthly salaries. There is too little focus on innovation and on achieving results. From a political point of view, we must focus on some areas that can allow us to leave this world a better place than it was when we took it over – areas which will also provide a large economic return, create new jobs and improve our competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="da">Energy efficiency also has the additional benefit of providing work for Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises. The three central pillars of the EU’s energy efficiency policy are, as I see it, the national action plans, the product policy and buildings. These are three very different types of policies, and if we start with the national action plans, they have not proven to be very effective, but they nevertheless have a large amount of potential. We therefore need to streamline them and give the Commission the opportunity to use them actively as a tool. The Commission will have the chance to reject the action plans if they are not sufficiently ambitious. This will result in transparency for citizens. However, it is of the utmost importance that we maintain the Member States’ independence and give them the opportunity to decide for themselves where they want to apply their efforts. Thus, in some countries, the potential for energy savings in buildings is greater than in other countries, just as entirely different countries will presumably focus on increased energy savings in connection with production.</p>
      <p sl="da">The second pillar is the product policy, which concerns both standards and labelling. Standards are, by far, the more important of the two, and it is very easy to demonstrate the size of the savings that will be made as a result of the standards, and again, this will increase innovation.</p>
      <p sl="da">The buildings policy is also important. Targets will be set in relation to the 2050 road map. Buildings are absolutely crucial in energy and climate policy. Forty percent of energy consumption comes from our buildings. This is an area where savings can be made that will be evident in the final accounts. I am convinced that these three areas will provide an important foundation for competitiveness and innovation for many years to come. Thus, the report recommends a financial instrument for leveraging investments in projects relating to energy efficiency. There are models in some European countries in which investments are leveraged many times over, and the question is whether the EU should not also arrange its finances in this way. I hope that Parliament can agree to adopt this report with a large political majority, as this is important – it is a very important area for Europe and for our enterprises.</p>

    <intervention id="2-628" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, first of all, I am grateful to Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Regional Development for the intensive debate and for the report that we are debating today. That applies to Mr Bendtsen in particular, but also to other Members who have been involved in this matter for a long time and have shown a high level of competence.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we just take stock of the interim situation with regard to the three 20% targets that we have been set – CO2 , renewable energies in the energy mix and greater energy efficiency: with regard to CO2 and renewable energies, we are making good progress, but where energy efficiency is concerned, we are just beginning. If we do not take action, we will not meet the target. That means that, although we have been set a target – Parliament, the Council, all European institutions – our progress, particularly after the crisis, is not likely to result in 20% more energy efficiency; instead, as things currently stand, it would only be possible to achieve a maximum of 8, 9, 10% in ten years’ time.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that I am not completely happy with the term energy efficiency, because no one except us understands it. If you ask your neighbours or your friends, they understand energy saving, but energy efficiency is just some sort of technical term. In fact, the issue we have with regard to this target is that what actually needs to be achieved has not yet been conclusively defined. We have an overall assessment of energy consumption for 2005, supplemented by data from 2007 on account of the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria, and that year is the starting point. The level of consumption referred to there is well-known. At that time – it was before my time – all decisions reflected a normal forecast, in other words, an energy demand that would increase, and from that, in turn, 20% was deducted. If energy savings are disregarded, will our energy demand actually increase, I ask myself. In my country – Germany – probably not. However, in new Member States – I only need to mention motor vehicles, the number of cars per inhabitant, housing sizes, industrial development – it certainly will increase. However, up to now, there has been no objective report that assesses the forecasts. Twenty percent – of how much, we do not know. We have PRIMES and other models – I have doubts about many of the predictions of the figures. For example, there are founder members of the European Union who claim their energy demand will increase sharply by 2020 without energy savings. The deduction of 20% gives exactly the same figures as those from 2005. That is surely not possible. That means, first of all, that we need figures, perspectives and forecasts that have authority. We want to produce these by February or March.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am counting on the Heads of State or Government to take this matter just as seriously in February as they did before the crisis, as it seems to me that, as things stand, the Member States will not vote for binding targets. They may achieve a majority in Parliament, but the Member States want to work on a voluntary basis and they are still a long way from agreeing to the binding targets decided on two or three years ago. Thus, we need to clarify what the forecast for 2020 is without energy efficiency – more from a purely theoretical point of view – and then simply cut it by 20%.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then we need to ask: where do we start? First of all, in the area of building stock. In the area of housing, work and industry, it is existing buildings where we have the most to do. In this regard, I see public owners – municipalities, states – setting an example. In other words, efficiency must, first of all, be sought wherever the state owns property. Secondly, we have structural programmes at European level and we have different refurbishment programmes in the various countries. We have to link these two together. We will perhaps have to provide less money for paving market places and have fewer bypasses, but instead, we will cofinance more energy efficiency. I also consider this to be a crucial objective for the next budgetary period at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then comes the subject of transport. It goes without saying that we have to make savings there when we know that there are some Member States in which there are 550 cars for every 1 000 members of the population – petrol and diesel engines – and others where there are 100 or 120. This will be harmonised, but not at a level of 100 cars per 1 000 citizens in Germany, but at 400 to 500 cars per 1 000 citizens in Europe. We therefore need more energy efficiency in the area of transport. Incidentally, the most efficient form of transport is the one that is avoided. Thirdly, there is industry and, fourthly, the energy sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question of the binding nature of any such measures has been discussed at length in the European Parliament. We brought this issue up at an informal lunch in the Energy Council a few weeks ago. I can tell you that the Member States and the energy ministers are handling the subject of energy efficiency very sensitively, but are not yet prepared to take a decision on binding targets. Incidentally, consider an emerging Member State like Poland: will it manage minus 20%? I doubt it. Or consider a saturated Member State like Germany, Austria or Italy: how would we get Austria or Germany, for example, to accept a cut of 30% so that Poland can adjust its economic development, number of cars per citizen and whatever else to the targets? In this regard, we still have some tough discussions ahead of us with regard to how this will be implemented in detail in the various sectors – industry, the energy sector, transport and housing – and in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will now take the report on board and I thank you for its contents. I want to debate this matter on 4 February in the European Council in order once again to see clearly how seriously the governments are taking this and I will then come back to you with a concrete proposal for a new energy efficiency plan. I am sure we will then have sufficient opportunity in spring and summer to discuss everything, including the question of binding targets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Bearing in mind the principle of subsidiarity, perhaps a two-stage plan might be the right approach. Stage 1 would be voluntary. We will expect national energy efficiency action plans to be provided on an annual basis and we will specify what we expect each year in terms of achieving the targets, but we will not wait until 2020. Instead, if appropriate, we will switch after two years to binding targets if we notice that in the first two years, the voluntary phase has not resulted in progress towards 20% in the Member States. Thank you very much for today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to make a correction: the German translation states that I am the chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but that is not correct. I am the rapporteur. However, in this role, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Bendtsen for his splendid work and excellent cooperation. He has presented an ambitious strategy on the subject of energy efficiency in the European Union. Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective means of lowering emissions and reducing our dependence on energy imports. This will create jobs in Europe, and the money we invest will no longer flow in the direction of Russia, the Middle East or other regions, but will remain in our economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Environment Committee has adopted a comprehensive opinion. I do not need to repeat everything it contains, but it is also very ambitious. Not everything it contains is of equal importance, either. However, I would like to emphasise two points once again. Firstly – we have talked about this, Commissioner – we propose that the European Union sets itself a long-term target in the area of energy efficiency, because if we plan up to 2050, we also need to know roughly how much we consume. Secondly, we have also pointed out the problems with the definition. I believe that we should take the quantity of energy consumed as the basis, as that is measurable and we have data for that. We do not have data for anything else as far as measurement per unit is concerned, for example. Therefore, this is the right approach in my view, and I hope that we can incorporate it into the strategy accordingly in the coming months.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency is one of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next 10 years. It is also a key element of our energy strategy. At present, the priority is for the report’s constructive provisions and the Commission’s energy strategy to be implemented by the Member States. For this to happen, several problems need to be resolved. At EU level, we are still facing the problem of measuring energy efficiency. We are currently using the 2020 forecasts for this purpose; however, it would not be sensible to adopt binding legal goals based on these forecasts. In terms of the future, we are not clairvoyants. For this reason, new and better technology needs to be developed, and this has already been mentioned in today’s discussion. This technology will allow us to achieve our goal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also important to take regional differences into account. The way that energy is used in Copenhagen is different to the way it is used in eastern Poland. There is no single plan of action that suits everything, and we have to ensure that these plans are compatible with reality. Regional and local authorities will be responsible for implementing policies on energy efficiency, and so the European Commission and Member States must coordinate their activities with local authorities. Otherwise, they will be perceived as bureaucratic red tape and the source of huge costs to regions and citizens. Without multi-level management and the earmarking of funding for this goal, the whole project will be condemned to failure.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank those who have worked on this report and, in particular, Mr Bendtsen. I would like to mention two aspects and perhaps give you pause for thought. We are all agreed that energy efficiency, using energy economically, is the most simple and most sensible solution. The question is: how do we achieve this goal? I would also like to ask the question: what have we actually achieved here in Parliament by keep going back to the people with new and higher percentages? Have we really achieved more and had more of an effect? Why and in which areas have we been using energy more efficiently? I am told that industry, which consumes a lot of energy, is using energy more efficiency because it saves money by doing so and because it is beneficial for it. I am also told that when people know that a particular appliance consumes more or less energy, in other words, if they can see that and can see an advantage to themselves, they will decide in favour of energy efficiency. Perhaps working with percentages is completely the wrong way to go about it and we should instead take an incentives approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second question is: the Commissioner made some very eloquent and clear comments about how complicated it is just to explain what energy efficiency is. What is it in fact? How differently is it implemented in the Member States? My fellow Member has just pointed out that the Member States also have very different situations in terms of their economies and geography – completely different. Is it the right solution to work with a single binding figure, or should we not think of something else? I think that, in terms of energy policy, we need, to a certain extent, to move away from the debate of the past, which sought to achieve something with simple figures, binding targets and miracle solutions, because we have clearly not achieved enough. Perhaps, for once, we should try the alternative route of differentiated, varied solutions, which takes account of the different situations, but then also achieves results. What matters is the effect we achieve rather than our particular circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have just one question for Mr Reul. Is it not possible to have binding targets in the course of development and yet still to regard them as differentiated? You contrasted ‘binding’ and ‘differentiated’, whereas I believe that it is possible to unite the two. I am completely behind some of the steps that the Commissioner has put forward, but perhaps we can find a way to proceed in a differentiated manner according to the geographical and other circumstances, but still ultimately obtain binding targets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, advocate differentiated solutions and, like you, Mr Swoboda, I am in the process of considering how such solutions can be brought about. We should not rule anything out at all in respect of where something is to be done. I will take today as my starting point. At the moment, I believe it to be the wrong approach to essentially buy ourselves a little leeway with binding targets and percentages. I would invite us all now to give more thought to what we can achieve and how, on a step-by-step basis. It saddens me that we have not achieved more. Perhaps we need to choose a different approach for that reason.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Bendtsen and the other rapporteurs for their productive cooperation on this report.</p>
      <p sl="da">We have succeeded in reaching agreement in many areas – not least, the ambition to harvest the low-hanging fruit resulting from boosting energy efficiency. There have also been areas of disagreement, however. We are not in agreement when it comes to setting ambitious and binding targets for energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="da">In my view, it is crucial that we stand firm on a minimum target of 20% increased energy efficiency. That is the way forward if we want a green and sustainable economy that can create a million new jobs in Europe. However, it is crucial that these energy efficiency targets are binding for the Member States, as it is plain for all to see that the EU has recommendations and objectives in a great many areas that are never realised in practice because they are not binding.</p>
      <p sl="da">At the same time, we have seen that binding targets do work. It is therefore obvious that this should also apply to energy efficiency measures. We know that this is easily the cheapest way of reducing CO2 emissions, guaranteeing the security of supply and, at the same time, ensuring that consumers have lower heating bills – and less expenditure on heating bills would represent progress, in particular, for the many Europeans affected by what we could term energy poverty.</p>
      <p sl="da">People suffer from energy poverty if a relatively large proportion of their income has to be spent on heating their home. There are currently no common definitions of energy poverty, nor are there any proper political initiatives in place to reduce it. The consequences of energy poverty are disastrous. It results in the deterioration of the health and the general living conditions of low income groups. We must therefore provide cheap loans for investments in energy efficiency in private homes and we must also use the Structural Funds for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow, and I hope that we can get a large majority to support the report and more forceful action to combat energy poverty.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I want to pay tribute to Mr Bendtsen who has worked extremely hard on this report and cooperated closely with the shadows from other parties. He has succeeded in bringing parliamentarians together on this issue and he deserves warm congratulations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Energy saving ticks an awful lot of boxes. First of all, climate change. Cancún has reminded us how much we need to do, and energy saving is the cheapest and easiest way of moving to a 30% reduction in greenhouse gases. Secondly, energy security. I was in Zaghreb last week discussing Croatia’s accession with Liberal colleagues, and they told me that Croatia imports 50% of its energy and also uses twice as much energy as it would do if proper energy efficiency measures were in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now that energy is a shared European competence under the Lisbon Treaty, energy efficiency must also be a shared responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">By doing more on energy saving, we are also tackling the very practical problems that people face in their lives. Too many people are living in fuel poverty, struggling to keep warm in houses that are not properly insulated. Making homes more energy efficient puts money in people’s pockets to spend in the local economy at this time of financial and economic difficulty. It would also create many thousands of jobs in the local economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">So, given all these positive effects, it comes as a great shock to realise that the 20% energy efficiency target is the one part of the 2020 package which is currently heading for failure, as the Commissioner said. Indeed, the latest figures show that we are on target to reach only 9% of the projected 20% by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="de">And the time has come I think for us to put up our hands and admit that we got it wrong in 2008. We should have made the target binding then, and we really need to go forward now and find ways of making it possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I thank the Commissioner for having given us an insight into what he is preparing for the next year. I think the time has come to make a political decision here that we have to have a binding energy saving target because without it, we are actually undermining everything else that we do on the economy, on energy security and on climate change.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work and, in principle, clearly, to support the adoption tomorrow of the report adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us come now to the unbelievable potential associated with energy savings, a point that has been made here. Reports from the European Commission itself say that if we called a halt to our excessive energy consumption, if we reduced our energy wastage by 20%, we could create one million jobs, we could save almost EUR 1 000 per European household, and we could clearly reduce our external energy bill.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A 20% energy saving or reduction in Europe is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos in energy terms, and we are currently missing that target. Mrs Hall made this point, and the way I see it, we have trouble calculating. If reports show today that we are far from achieving 20%, then we can evaluate the savings that we make or do not make each year. We also know that this eco-design or eco-labelling approach for cars and so on does not result in overall coherence and does enable us to obtain the results that we are seeking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am a little surprised at the debate that we are having here. Excuse me, Commissioner, but when you say that we have a problem in defining energy efficiency, this is perhaps true from a theoretical point of view, but the climate and energy package is very clear on the objective. It says that energy consumption must be reduced by 20% below the baseline level. This problem does not have to do with the definition of energy efficiency. There are energy levels that we need to return to – that is what the climate and energy package says.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are told that we do not need a binding objective. We are thus making one on renewables. A few days ago, in Cancún, the European Commission negotiated a binding agreement on climate change and tried to defend the Kyoto Protocol, and in this House we are citing the arguments of the United States and China by saying: ‘We will go for voluntary targets, and then, if one day we realise that they are not working, we will create binding targets’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the report under examination, a number of Members have proposed strengthening the part on building. There is scope to take a large-scale European initiative on building, which nevertheless accounts for 40% of our energy consumption; we can go much further on renovation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, citizens are today facing the cold. They are paying very high prices for their energy. If Europe emerges from the crisis, energy will be much more expensive internationally. Citizens will be confronted with a two-fold increase in energy prices. We must move much more quickly, and I would also ask you, Commissioner, to please stress to Mr Van Rompuy that the 4 February meeting should also be a meeting about energy consumption. From this point of view, the road map that he is proposing today is outrageous.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like most of all to thank the rapporteur for the very constructive and open cooperation in preparing the report. In my speech, I would like to focus on one issue. Our political group will not be able to accept the introduction of binding energy efficiency goals for the European system. First and foremost, we do not have a common methodology for measuring efficiency; too many indicators are not comparable. Goals should be set for each country separately so that the varying potential for savings is taken into account as well as current achievements in this area. I will give the example of my country – since 1990, Poland has improved its energy efficiency by 50%. Despite this, Poland remains a country of low efficiency compared to the European average. The introduction of a uniform, binding goal will be politically harmful and mean that the cost of making changes will be spread unequally between Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would also like to begin by saying that I believe this to be a good time to table a motion to review the Action Plan on Energy Efficiency and, if there are any doubts, I believe that the debate that we are having here today will clarify things. Energy efficiency policy is absolutely fundamental in a number of sectors, from buildings to energy infrastructure, information and communications technology, transport, matters of finance, all of these issues and many more, and all other sectors. It is essential that we have coordinated and joined-up policies, because otherwise, we cannot achieve our objectives. Energy efficiency policy is also essential to enable us to combat climate change, as I have already mentioned, in connection with the reduction of emissions to which we need to respond.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot have a discussion, on the one hand, in support of reducing emissions and, on the other, have another discussion relating to energy efficiency saying it is not possible. I would therefore like to make a few points that seem to me to be fundamental to this discussion. Firstly, it is important for us to set binding targets. As I have mentioned before, the situation whereby we still have voluntary criteria has simply brought us to where we are now: we cannot set binding targets because it will be impossible to achieve 20% energy efficiency by 2020, and we will tell the European public that, in the end, it was an empty promise, and that nothing of the sort is going to happen in reality, because we only achieved 9%. I believe that this is an unacceptable argument that contradicts itself, because the fact that we are not going to achieve 20% energy efficiency is precisely why we do not set binding targets to do so. If targets have this effect, they also have the effect of providing the motivation for policies and projects. If we do not want to do this, we are being cowards, and cannot depend on good will. We have to depend, unfortunately in this case, on political will.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I hope that tomorrow, the political will is leaning towards setting this target of 20% energy efficiency by 2020, and not just because achieving this will enable one million jobs to be created: new jobs, and we are not in a position where we can miss the opportunity to create jobs. What seems to be happening here with this assumption of no joint commitment is the same thing that is happening with economic policy at European level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union is showing itself to be incapable of having an economic policy for job creation. It is also showing itself to be incapable of having a common energy efficiency policy. I hope that this does not remain the case, I hope that we are successful not only in this sector, but also in the construction sector, and I sincerely hope that tomorrow, we are able to give a response that is not only coordinated and articulate, but a response to the crisis that we are experiencing.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the negotiated revision of the action plan for energy efficiency describes many ways in which the Europe Union might contribute to fulfilling its ambition for a planned reduction in greenhouse gas volumes by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The philosophy of the submitted elaboration is based on the logical notion that we can achieve dramatic cuts in production costs and environmental pollution if we manage to handle energy rationally and if we take necessary and affordable measures to limit energy waste in all energy consumption sectors. The proposed measures do not apply only to the area of energy infrastructure, in other words, production and transmission of energy, but also to the construction sector, industrial output and transport. The measures are generally depicted as fundamental postulates, with no need to describe their expected benefit. It is undoubtedly a good thing that the EU will have a kind of summary list of measures enabling a gradual increase in energy efficiency. However, with regard to the target deadline for the EU commitment to reduce the volume of greenhouse gases produced in Europe by 20% by 2020, it would perhaps be a good idea to think about the measures, scope, cost and end result we are prepared to implement in the next 10 years within the framework of current options and powers.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am not saying that we should give up on promoting changes or on increasing efficiency in energy production and transmission, but in view of the cost and the amount of time required for planning, design and implementation, I do not think that much will change in this area by 2020, or even in a number of other proposed measures. I therefore firmly believe that it would be a good thing if the Commission could now select measures from the previously mentioned extensive document that are feasible from an organisational, financial and timing perspective, and on which we can concentrate in order to create a strong initial impulse for the adoption of an energy handling philosophy as a component in the thinking of the specialist community at first, and the wider public later. After all, Commissioner, we are already attempting to provide support with the heating of buildings, and encouraging people to swap consumer goods or cars, so that they can purchase more efficient and better ones. Let us continue with this in a more emphatic, and perhaps more sophisticated way, and let us provide further encouragement for the introduction of new and sensible measures. In my opinion, that is the way to boost energy efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a question. Who knows how much oil and gas we import in Europe? Who knows how much oil and gas we extract in Europe? The answer is that, although we do extract a certain amount in Europe itself, compared to our requirements, we import oil and gas on a massive scale from the Middle East and Russia. This dependence on imports, which is on an upward trend, also means that it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to shape relations with these third countries on an objective basis. However, ladies and gentlemen, let us reflect for a moment on what this importation of oil and gas is. What does it mean for our populations? It is, in fact, the export of Europe’s money to these third countries. By importing oil and gas, we are actually exporting money.</p>
      <p sl="lv">What do we know about the future? We know that in future, the price we pay for oil and gas will only increase, for these resources are becoming ever less accessible and ever more expensive to extract. This means that in future, if we do not alter our behaviour, we shall continue to export increasing amounts of our own money out of the European Union to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Ladies and gentlemen, there is a simple way of stopping this massive export of money from the European Union, and it is extremely simple: we do it by conserving. By conserving energy. By conserving energy, we are actually gaining money, which we can invest not in third countries but in our own economies. I therefore call on all my fellow Members to support Mr Bendtsen’s report on energy efficiency, which is a way in which we can actually help our own economy. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I, too, would like to start by thanking Mr Bendtsen. The conclusion is very clear in the report. We need binding energy efficiency targets as soon as possible, and this is important for a whole host of reasons: economic reasons and reasons relating to competition, jobs, the environment and the climate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Commissioner Oettinger mentioned the issue of language. This relates to energy saving or energy efficiency, and the question is: what are we actually talking about? In my country, we usually say that it is stupid to let the fire go up the chimney. In other words, we should not use our energy resources in such a way that we get insufficient benefit from them. That is rather self-evident, and several of you mentioned the balance between energy production and the costs involved in production, taking risks with it and the consumption of energy. We must, of course, be as smart as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">How are we to measure the targets that the Commissioner mentioned? As in all other contexts where we have common ambitions at global or European level, we need to agree on a common measurement method and then decide on binding targets. What we are putting to the test right now is the inefficiency of not having binding targets and, using the step-by-step method, we are putting off making a change until the future. I think we should stop doing that and we should support Mr Bendtsen.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency has always been the biggest resource proffered to us. It is the sleeping giant with the hidden but enormous potential for the European energy economy. All that is true, and the nice thing about it is that it is so free of ideology. Above all, the approach to this issue can be technology-neutral.</p>
      <p sl="de">All that interests us here, and it is a point that is clearly also a little divisive, is the issue of whether or not the targets are binding. I have to say, Commissioner, in this regard, that I like your two-stage approach whereby you start by trusting in the Member States and by building voluntary agreements and then, if we observe that we will not achieve the targets by 2020, we perhaps get the thumbscrews out. That is the right approach to take.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report, by and large, moves in the right direction – there is little to criticise. There is one issue that I would like to raise, however, which is the role of the regional funds. You mentioned this issue, Commissioner. In the regional funds, together with the Cohesion Funds, we have an immense instrument in our hands in the European Union that we are not making use of. In this field of energy efficiency, we could finally create European added value which we could put to use in an innovative way to get to grips with energy efficiency in a way that has not happened in the past. As the current rapporteur for budgetary discharge for the Commission, I can see just how badly we have wasted money in the sphere of cohesion. Let us put a stop to that waste! I endorse the focus that you are giving to this issue, Commissioner Oettinger, and the fact that you are seeking to bring about greater use of these funds, including for this energy efficiency instrument. That is the only way that we will ensure that there really is cohesion, at least in the energy sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">I feel I must warn against smear campaigns, as we saw with light bulbs and with shower heads. Such campaigns are the kind of things that alienate the citizens. We must thus ensure that we aim to achieve energy efficiency in general and that we keep this objective in mind without pursuing ideological smear campaigns that ultimately lead to the citizens losing their positive impression of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="nl">First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bendtsen, for the report which he has prepared and which lays down the core of what needs to happen here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, let us put everything into perspective. Everyone knows that, by 2050, Europe has to reduce its greenhouse emissions either by 80% or, as we advocate, by 95%. That is an incredible challenge. Where can we make the biggest savings? The biggest savings are to be made if we consume even less energy. We would then need to import less energy, replace less energy, that is, develop fewer alternatives, and that is simply the cheapest way forward. It is therefore absurd that, while we are already aware that Europe is on course to fail to meet this very energy conservation target, we, and particularly those of us in the Commission, continue to focus on achieving reduction and renewable energy targets. This means that energy conservation, or using less energy, is a target that we are going to fail to meet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is so much energy that could be saved from everything around us, though. For example, from the built environment. The built environment consumes approximately 40% of our energy, 99% of which is accounted for by existing buildings. They have to be adapted to make them more energy efficient. The current rate of adaptation in Europe is 1.4% per year: in other words, it will take us more than 60 years to replace our built environment in its entirety. That will take us up to 2070 but, meanwhile, we have set ourselves targets which we have to reach by 2050!</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is exactly what this should be about: we have to ensure that we can make energy savings in the built environment, for example, in a much faster timeframe, which is why we have submitted an amendment for a European Building Initiative. It will save everyone money, it is a cheaper option, we will be preparing ourselves for the future and – most importantly – it will save people money. They will not have to spend so much on energy. Now, that is an argument that you hardly ever hear. Ultimately, however, ordinary people will have to spend less on energy. That is what this should be about!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ever since September 2009, Europeans have been exchanging traditional light bulbs, to which they had grown accustomed, for those produced with new, energy saving technology. The need for this change was justified by energy saving slogans, and the change has taken place despite signs that the financial costs to be borne by EU citizens would be too great, particularly over such a short period of time. It is an open secret that the data presented at the time by the European Commission regarding the effects of such a change came from the advertising materials of the producers of these new-technology light bulbs, and there is a great deal of evidence to indicate that this was the case.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the report being discussed, we can see similarly over-optimistic assumptions. Insufficient reference is made to the development differences between the EU Member States and, as a result, to the costs they will have to bear if the recommendations are implemented. If industrial plants are to make annual energy saving improvements of 2% as stated, while, at the same time, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the result will be an increase in production costs and the transfer of production outside Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, trying to make savings is a real challenge – a challenge which will enable us to reduce Europe’s dependence, a challenge which will enable us to release substantial financial resources which can finance research into new forms of energy production, and a challenge which will enable us to revitalise our regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While the energy efficiency of buildings must be at the centre of our concerns, it is essential that the objectives and actions of the Union, like those of the Member States, focus on social housing, because the poorest must benefit the most from our energy efficiency efforts. We must put an end to this scandal of making the poorest pay the highest energy bills, while at the same time, in the name of energy efficiency, fiscal loopholes are created which allow the richest to reduce their bills while paying less tax.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A true energy efficiency policy should also mean an opportunity to sell electricity at a lower price to railways, metros and trams, as happened in France before the European directives on the single energy market prohibited it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, one of the first measures would be to abolish the single electricity market within the Union, because competition on a product such as electricity, which cannot be stored and is hard to transport, is an aberration with regard to energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, energy efficiency will not create high quality jobs unless it is based on a genuine EU strategic industrial initiative which is free of the constraints of the free market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on system innovation, such as intelligent networks, intelligent measurement systems, easier integration of renewable energy sources and also the development of a comprehensive strategy for heat generation producers and distributors. However, I believe that the greatest savings and the greatest efficiency are to be achieved by fostering the personal responsibility of every European Union citizen. Just as we learned to save water, we have to learn to respect energy and use it efficiently. All procedures for granting permission for new infrastructure should be simplified and accelerated in order to maximise potential savings.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Energy efficiency and energy security will be priorities in the upcoming Hungarian Presidency of the European Union. Poland, which will take over the Presidency from Hungary, and which has included the matter of energy security in its agenda, will also intensify the debate on modern legislative and non-legislative solutions that will allow the European energy sector to stay competitive while, at the same time, improving energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have to highlight at this point that for me personally, an increasingly critical issue is the plausibility of forecasts and the quality of the PRIMES model used by the European Union, particularly in view of the failure to achieve a consensus in Cancún. This is a subject for a separate debate, but I would like to appeal now for consideration to be given to a new, post-crisis approach to the issue of consumption and energy demands in the European Union. Transport seems to be the most appropriate way to implement modern, energy efficient solutions. Energy efficiency in the European Union should be adapted in the direction of demand, which is directly tied to expenditure and changes in citizens’ habits. In my opinion, changes will be brought about by measurable benefits for consumers and appropriate incentives and long-term forms of funding for manufacturers.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, achieving a high degree of energy efficiency is the fundamental political aim of the European Union, as it is an integral component in the overall strategy of building a competitive, low carbon economy which will stimulate business activity and improve employment by creating plenty of new jobs. With tomorrow’s vote on the energy efficiency plan, the European Parliament will send a strong signal to the Commission and the Council on the need for urgent and targeted measures in this area.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In the first place, I call upon the European Commission to conduct a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of existing legislation on the renewal of the current housing stock and higher energy standards for new builds. Creating an effective energy infrastructure and developing modern technologies for vehicles are other important priorities which I hope will be part of the Commission’s proposed new energy efficiency plan for 2011.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In conclusion, I would say that energy efficiency has the potential to, and must, become a profitable business. It can do this on its own and produce a high social return.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, reality shows that it is not enough to adopt an Action Plan for Energy Efficiency. An assessment needs to be made of the results of the 2006 plan, and policies put in place to help targets to be implemented, diversifying methods of increasing energy efficiency. The crisis argument cannot be used as an excuse for non-fulfilment of the 20% objective in 2020, nor for shooting down solutions for resolving the serious problem of energy poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is important to report positive experiences from other countries, not forgetting China and the United States, and to invest in the funding of measures that increase energy efficiency in buildings, in social housing, and in transport and industry. The necessary resources should be included within the EU budget to support Member States and families that have greater difficulties. Energy efficiency also increases employment, reduces poverty, and is a factor in progress and social development. We need to invest in this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, you put forward a very sound plan, and Mr Bendtsen made it even better. We must succeed in breaking through the equation ‘more economic growth equals more energy consumption at the same time’. This poses a particular challenge of us, as politicians, as we have normal technological progress which is, of course, characterised by the fact that we have more energy efficient products and modes of economic operation. We must succeed, however, in reducing our energy bills despite stronger economic growth. In this connection, we need to bring forward truly innovative solutions and provide the right incentives through policy. Economic history, too, has shown that those societies that enjoyed the most success over the long term were those societies that made this efficiency – whether in relation to raw materials or energy – the motto that they lived by. This is a particular challenge for us Europeans, with our high standard of living.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to drive forward energy efficiency if, realistically, we hope to attain our climate targets. I would also like to take the liberty of reminding you that reducing the dependence on imports of fossil fuels remains an important policy goal. In addition, the capital that is freed up as a result of the lower power bills releases a major potential for consumption which, furthermore, can contribute to our economic growth in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="de">That said, I believe that the approach that you have chosen, which is to say, not laying down these targets in binding form, is the correct one. We should not allow ourselves to get lost in debates about definitions and problems of measurement. It is important that we chart the path forward. The Commission and the rapporteur are taking the right approach in this regard. We should indeed leave this target as non-binding, but that does not mean that we should lower our ambitions. For the reasons stated, those ambitions must continue to be set high, but choosing a path where this can only be achieved through a binding target is not the right way to go and our group will therefore be rejecting that approach.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bendtsen on a very good report. Basically, I have just one comment to make, Commissioner, and that is that your background is in regional politics, in a large state in Germany, whereas mine is in local politics. We will not achieve the targets, whether binding or otherwise – and I advocate binding targets – if we do not address states, regions and communities directly and specify to them what can be done. When I think of the refurbishment of housing, transport policy – which, thank God, you repeatedly mention – and combating energy poverty, these are areas that are not regulated at the national level but essentially at the local, the regional and the municipal level. We therefore also have to be active at that level. It would be a major opportunity to win over the towns and the communities to our great European project of energy efficiency, energy saving and, of course, other areas of energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore ask that you act accordingly and perhaps also give some consideration to how we can better get through to the citizens, specifically via the towns, the communities and the regions, as that connection is absolutely vital in order to make it possible to actually get those targets accepted – binding or otherwise.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency is crucial for increasing security of supply, improving air quality, reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and increasing the competitiveness of our society. Energy efficiency means doing more with fewer resources. This report sets out an ambitious vision for energy efficiency through, for example, the introduction of individual goals and positive incentives. Important elements are introduced with regard to the modernisation of energy infrastructure, such as smart networks, energy efficiency within buildings and transport, the use of information and communication technologies, and the development of scientific research in the area of energy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report underlines the need to double the funding for scientific research into technological development and demonstration in the area of energy.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, although many legislative measures have been introduced in the area of energy efficiency and saving, not all of them are producing the desired results. According to scientific research, at the current rate of progress, we will not even achieve half of the 20% target set. Therefore, it is necessary to take more binding measures and greater control in the Member States. I believe that when revising the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the European Commission must seriously take into account the fact that the Member States are not exploiting energy saving opportunities sufficiently, which is preventing an increase in energy independence. It is also necessary for individual Member States to set binding energy efficiency targets and monitor how they are implemented, because otherwise, the huge potential for energy saving will remain untapped.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, I am happy to make a few comments on this report. It is an excellent report, because it will enable us to achieve a number of things simultaneously: not only environmental and CO2 reduction objectives, but also some of our production objectives and other objectives designed to ensure that we remain competitive. It will be kind on both the environment and the wallet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, you have also spoken of your ambition to produce an action plan within a short timeframe. Allow me, however, to make three points: my first point concerns national energy efficiency action plans. There is a great deal more scope for improvement there and they need to be examined critically by the European Commission. Commissioner, you have indicated that you will be working in two stages. The first stage will involve consultation, but with some pressure being applied, and the second will possibly involve a degree of coercion. I have insisted on pressure being brought to bear in my earlier discussions with the Commissioner and in my amendments, and I am pleased that this issue is now gaining prominence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have just one question for the Commissioner: will you have sufficient instruments to enable you to stay the course whilst moving into the coercion stage? Could you give us an analysis of that, now, or in the near future, or in your action plan?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second point is about regional policy. Mr Swoboda has also spoken about this. A great deal more could be done with those funds. In most countries, the funds that are available are not even being used to improve energy efficiency. I have therefore tabled an amendment to Article 81 in order to clarify its wording. It does not always have to mean more money; it is also about spending existing resources wisely.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, my third point – and here, too, I agree with Mr Swoboda – we need to get citizens, local authorities and companies more involved in energy conservation, through measures such as quality marks, covenants with mayors and agreements with industry. In my country, the Netherlands, an agreement with industry alone has already resulted in a 2% improvement in energy efficiency a year. Now, that is a measure of what we could achieve in concrete terms! Thank you, I wish you every success, and thanks to the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, between 50 and 125 million European citizens are affected by energy poverty. This is why we think that priority should be given to energy savings and energy efficiency policies in the area of social housing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Only 1% of the buildings which will be standing in 2020 will be new buildings. This is why, when discussing existing buildings, we cannot talk about binding targets without allocating sufficient financial resources. For this reason, we think that innovative funding schemes are required, as well as fiscal facilities which will make investments in energy efficiency attractive and provide long-term institutional support.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, a meeting of the CONCERTO programme group was held recently in Parliament, five years after it was set up. Unfortunately, the 400 representatives from local and regional authorities mentioned that it is not known at local and regional level that all Member States have the opportunity to use 4% of the European Regional Development Fund allocation at national level for energy efficiency in buildings.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For this reason, I would like to end, Commissioner, by asking you to use the mid-term review to allocate a larger sum of funding to energy efficiency programmes and, in particular, to promote the opportunities to use up to 15% of the European Regional Development Fund for energy efficiency in the future financial perspective.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Bendtsen for his precise report.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commissioner opened this sitting by saying – and I agree with him – that we are somewhat rhetorical today when we talk about efficiency, that uncertainty surrounds the 20% target, given that it has already been halved, and we do not really know what we are referring to. I would add that the culture of energy saving and energy efficiency does not exist.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore find ourselves in a situation and at a point where we have no option but to change. How? First, I believe that we should move towards innovation and new technologies in both areas – the energy efficiency of buildings and, above all, the energy efficiency of transport.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to focus on the importance of having sufficient resources to achieve these objectives. I believe that we have to spend in order to save. Today in Parliament, President Barroso stated that Eurobonds are not going to be used and that he has other financial instruments set aside.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, we recently adopted a report that establishes a fund for financing energy efficiency through the use of the funds left over from the previous recovery plans. Even with a limited budget, I think the fund is highly symbolic insofar as it establishes the principle of attracting private capital in a public-private partnership (PPP) model, rationalising the funds that are already at our disposal – Cohesion Funds and others – and putting them into a container that can attract money, that, instead of giving money away, loans it through the development of major projects; it should be a revolving fund that gives meaning to all of this.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe this is the right system for seeking resources and ensuring that efficiency is no longer a taboo subject.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am satisfied that ample attention has been paid to the energy performance of buildings; initiatives in this regard must be undertaken at European level also.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to come back to one point: the importance of adopting a binding energy efficiency target for the European economy. Under the difficult economic conditions in a series of Member States which need powerful incentives for growth and for the protection and creation for jobs, a binding target will create a suitable investment environment for strengthening the competitiveness and export potential of European companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises trading in energy efficiency technologies and services.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Member States will acquire the incentives needed to strengthen those markets in each economy on which they can offer the greatest added value and create the most jobs. In addition, households, businesses and the public sector will have considerable comparative economic benefits, as they will have lower energy bills.

Clearly, the key figures required need to represent a challenge, but they must also always retain an adequate sense of proportion; they always have to be realistic. They need to be efficient for society but also for the individual, and it needs to be affordable for owners. For citizens, it must be comprehensible and explicable and, above all, it must also be economically feasible for them. This is because, without public acceptance, there will be no climate protection.

If we do not invest in sectors such as energy performance and energy savings, we shall lose twice over. On the one hand, our households, our businesses and our public services will continue to pay absurd costs and, on the other, we risk losing the lead in the green economy in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why we need to think that, if we are already having trouble competing with countries such as China, how will we be able to compete in future with a green China?

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy efficiency policies implemented so far by the various Member States for 2020 will not enable us to achieve the target of a 20% reduction in energy consumption; we will be lucky to manage 10%, which is a decidedly disappointing result.</p>
      <p sl="it">If energy consumption continues to increase, achieving the 20% renewable energy target may also be in jeopardy, since that target is calculated as a proportion of the EU’s final energy consumption.

Accordingly, the call for energy efficiency is also welcome. The buildings we use are responsible for approximately 40% of the world’s energy consumption, and therefore, addressing the matter of these buildings is of exceptional importance. We must take a step towards new, zero CO2 emission properties, and we must also find a solution for the problems of upgrading existing buildings in terms of energy efficiency. Additionally, we must continuously reduce the consumption and pollutant emissions of vehicles by urging the introduction of hybrid and fully electrical technologies.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you to Mr Bendtsen for mentioning the construction industry in his opening remarks. I would just like to bring to his attention that my report on construction products will be voted upon in January and we did discuss energy efficiency in that report, too.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, two quick points. Mr Swoboda mentioned the importance of local authorities. I just wanted to bring to the House’s attention the sensitivity at the moment, certainly in the UK, of budgetary cuts that are affecting local authorities.

I am sorry we do not have anybody from the Presidency this evening, but I think that is important.

    <intervention id="2-666" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by endorsing Mr Swoboda’s comment that implementation takes place on the spot – regionally and locally. In fact, we have manifold, mostly positive experience of refurbishment programmes – often with each euro of public money attracting six or seven euro of private investment. We will also need to examine whether our regional programmes can be involved in this. I find it difficult to imagine that a local authority would apply to the Commission directly for funding, but opening up the regional programmes to a greater extent to the vigorous refurbishment of the building stock would seem to me to be a very important step for the next funding period at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is then also the question of an interest-rate rebate on loans. Do we want to use public structural banks to reduce the interest rates for loans relating to the refurbishment of buildings? There is also a point I would like to make in relation to building stock. It has been said a number of times that if you increase energy efficiency, you save money. That is true, but not immediately. If we look at Europe’s housing stock, we can see that, on average, the required refurbishment for each dwelling – from windows, to active and passive insulation and right down to appropriate electric equipment and appropriate improvements to heating systems – would amount to EUR 30 000 to 60 000 per dwelling. You do not save the money in the first year. The result of this is that we need to invest for the next 10 years in order for energy expenditure to be reduced and reinvested for the next 40 years. In essence, this represents an intergenerational contract in reverse. Hitherto, my generation has built up enormous debts, as evinced by the currency problems we have been having. Now, for the first time, we have the opportunity to invest, through energy efficiency, so that in forthcoming decades, our children will reap the rewards via lower expenditure on energy. Can we do this? Are we ready to do so? I am counting on you. We need to lay down new priorities in relation to budgetary issues. Anyone who brings up energy efficiency refurbishment within the European budget also needs to address it from the point of view of the consequences. We will not receive any more money, so where do we want to reorganise? That will be the crucial issue in relation to this subject at the European budgetary level, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have a second issue to raise as well. Two Members of this House, Messrs Jadot and Eickhout, have said that the basis is clear. I have to disagree, however: it is not clear. I say that with the decisions of the European Council on the table here. Incidentally, the last decision by the European Council from March of this year, which stated – and I quote – ‘and moving towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency’ is, in itself, something of a reduction in consistency. This is because ‘moving towards 20%’ also means that 18, 19 or 17% would also be sufficient. I am sticking by 20%, unchanged, although the European Council adopted something of a retreat from this for the first time in March. The decision of March 2007 refers to projections of energy consumption in 2020, which were to be cut by 20%.</p>
      <p sl="de">The body that supplies Europe with studies in this regard is PRIMES. I will cite three columns of figures to show you what problems we are facing in this connection, which have not been raised so far. Italy’s energy consumption for 2007 was 173 million tonnes. The projection for 2020 was a rise to 208 million tonnes, from which the 20% was then to be subtracted. That then leaves Italy roughly where it was before. The projection goes up and the 20% is subtracted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Or let us take the example of a really small country – Luxembourg. Luxembourg’s energy consumption for 2007 was 4.6 million tonnes. The forecast demand rises to 5.6 million tonnes, but that is then reduced to 4.5 million again. Or let us take Portugal as an example. The consumption for the reference year was 23.8 million tonnes, which then increases to 30 million, before being brought back down to 24 million. We urgently need to discuss the projections. This is the crucial point and it has been dealt with too briefly in the debate overall, country by country.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many of you have risen to advocate binding targets. I am an optimist and a realist. If we in the Commission were to put forward a binding target for each Member State, these would, today, be rejected by the Member States, of which we are all also citizens. There is thus no chance of us doing so, as we would then achieve nothing at all. Perhaps a two-stage plan, where we take the Member States with us, would be more realistic and more pertinent. In such a plan, I would instruct the Member States to now create national efficiency plans on a voluntary basis, but the 20% would apply all round. If we observe in two years’ time that we have not made sufficiently consistent progress, then we will issue binding targets, which the Member States would then presumably not be in a position to reject. I ask you all to examine whether this – including to the knowledge of your governments – would not perhaps be the better European route for our common targets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether binding or voluntary, national action plans are required. We can examine the contents, the consistency and the impact of the plans from a policy point of view. We will also certainly not accept unchanged any plan whose contents do not meet our specifications. We would send back any such plan on a policy basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thank you all very much for today. I would be happy to return here to Parliament in March in order to formally launch the debate with a proposal. The report is an excellent first step towards this.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for a constructive debate. If people are sitting and listening to this, it might seem as though there is a great deal of disagreement on energy efficiency. Binding targets or not, energy efficiency is something on which we need to take a stand. It is something that we need to do something about. I would like to point out that even though we have had a comprehensive debate on this subject – binding targets – the rapporteurs have, of course, also discussed the fact, and agreed, that it is important for us to ensure compliance with current EU legislation in this area. We have enacted legislation on a great many things. It is important that this legislation is complied with, and it is important that it is implemented. It is also important for us to take action in connection with urban development, buildings, the use of new energy technologies and in respect of a better product policy. Transport is also something that we need to take a stand on and, last but not least, it is important to get many of these energy initiatives financed in the future. From where I stand, there is still plenty of ripe fruit within reach that we have the opportunity to pick – in other words, opportunities to increase energy efficiency in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="da">Why is it so important now? I will not repeat what my fellow Member, Mr Kariņš, from Latvia said in this context, namely, that Europe is paying out a great deal of money to both the Middle East and Russia. Could this money not be put to better use in Europe? That is not all: there is no doubt that if Europe wants to lead the way in this area, it is necessary for us to invest. The investments will, of course, bring dividends in the form of higher employment, more innovative enterprises and new jobs – in particular, jobs for our small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="da">Having said all that, I would like to thank all of those involved. I would like to thank the Commission and the relevant services. I would like to say that you have all been very willing to cooperate, and I would like to thank my own group, which has shown a great deal of trust and supported me right the way through the work on the report. I would also like to say thank you to the shadow rapporteurs for their extremely constructive cooperation, in which they also showed resistance. However, what is important now that we have come this far is that a clear signal is being sent from this Parliament to the Commission concerning the way we need to go in order to achieve energy efficiency in the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Energy efficiency measures are vital so that the EU can achieve the targets it has set for itself for combating climate change. We have a target of cutting energy consumption by 20%. However, whereas we have directives for the other two objectives, clearly setting out how the target will be achieved, we have no such instrument for energy efficiency. This is why I insist on the need for an energy efficiency directive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, to be able to achieve the results we want, energy efficiency must be promoted at every level, in every national and European policy. Innovation is one of the keys to success in this respect. This is why I think that the future Research Framework Programme ought to make energy efficiency a priority.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I believe that public authorities must set an example in this respect and turn the buildings they own into energy efficient buildings.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, Member States can promote energy efficiency through the requirements stipulated in public procurement procedures. Therefore, priority must be given to businesses which use cleaner technologies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, Member States can boost demand for green products using fiscal measures or subsidies compatible with the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Energy Efficiency Action Plan is not a competition in which obstacles and hurdles are placed in one’s way, but the start of a cultural process, a key European policy objective aimed at influencing the behaviour of individuals and businesses. It is a process that is made easier not by strict constraints that create unaffordable costs for citizens and businesses, but by real incentives; a process that is realised by means of energy infrastructure, changing urban development, products, packaging and transport. I would point out that energy efficiency is considered to be the most cost-effective way of managing greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions resulting from energy production. Furthermore, according to a study carried out by Confindustria , the General Confederation of Italian Industry, in Italy alone, energy efficiency could have a socio-economic impact on the entire national economy worth some EUR 238 billion and could increase the value of total production, with an associated rise in employment of around 1.6 million standard work units, in the period 2010-2020. I therefore consider it vital not only to channel investment into this sector, but also to ensure the effective implementation and strengthening of the European instruments available.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Energy efficiency, in the most general terms, is the restriction of individual consumption by rationalising appliance use. Essential opportunities for increasing gross energy efficiency are, however, to be found in physical and chemical industrial processes, which are based on: 1) better use of heat streams from fossil or nuclear fuels by a) transferring Carnot cycle conversion to a higher temperature and pressure, b) using appropriate recuperation of waste heat, e.g. in cogeneration processes; 2) reducing Ohm resistance during the transmission of current; 3) reducing heat resistance in heat exchangers; 4) increasing heat resistance by using insulating materials in construction; 5) reducing friction resistance; 6) reducing magnetic field losses; 7) shortening excessively long energy conversion chains.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The political goal of 3x20 by 2020 does not therefore relate merely to limiting energy use by 20% gross, for example, as a result of price increases, as this would only cause a fall in living standards, but rather by means of rationalisation, which would allow 20% more useful work to be obtained from the same amount of primary energy. Appropriate methods for Member States to evaluate the implementation of this political goal will therefore be needed.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The revision of the 2006 Energy Efficiency Action Plan is an increasingly urgent task since, in connection with the EU’s 20-20-20 targets, the lack of progress is most evident in the area of energy efficiency targets. Many initiatives already point in the right direction, but the present achievements are still dwarfed by the range of unexploited possibilities. Europe has just begun to recognise its lack of progress, and has realised that it cannot afford the luxury of taking the development of energy efficiency lightly. Such investments can reduce emissions more cheaply than any other solutions, and can immediately invigorate the economy. One sign of a positive turning point is that on the basis of the European Parliament’s decision, even the hitherto unused resources of the Economic Recovery Programme can be used for energy efficiency developments and green investments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Energy 2020 strategy published by the European Commission in November also ranks energy efficiency as the highest priority. Now it is the Bendtsen report that formulates specific recommendations as to how we could exploit our possibilities more effectively. I am glad that innovative solutions such as smart grids and ESCOs that implement investments producing a return on energy efficiency have also been included in the report. However, financing still remains the most important issue. Energy efficiency aids must be included in future long-term EU budgets as well, having particular regard to the building reconstruction programmes of the former socialist countries. This is the area where impressive savings can be realised with relatively small outlay.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Energy efficiency is one of the key priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy and the Energy Strategy for Europe 2011-2020, which also makes the submitted report highly important and topical in relation to the recent summit in Cancún. The report builds on the Energy Efficiency Action Plan from 2006, calls on the Commission to update this plan, to revise the directive on energy services and also to establish binding targets to achieve a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. The report discusses arguments for the advantages of greater energy efficiency: social (potential creation of 1 million jobs or decline in energy poverty in the EU), economic (potential energy savings of up to EUR 100 billion), strategic (retaining the competitiveness of European companies through energy savings) and, last but not least, energy security (greater energy self-sufficiency for the EU). The report includes recommendations in the area of energy infrastructure, the development of towns and buildings, information and communications products, tenders and financing. In my opinion, the role of the funding sources (the Structural Funds, the ELENA instrument of the European Investment Bank, national funds for energy efficiency, etc.) in financing energy efficiency projects is particularly important. Overall, I think that the report submitted by Mr Bendtsen contains an accurate analysis of this issue, as well as relevant recommendations on energy efficiency, and I therefore recommend approving it in its proposed form.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It is the essential interest of the EU, and of all its Member States, to make the most of as little energy as possible. In doing so, the dependency on external energy can be reduced, energy security can be increased, and so can the competitiveness of the European Union. Energy efficiency must therefore have special priority in the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, and the drawing of as much of the energy funds as possible should be made conditional to its principle. In accordance with the targets undertaken under the Europe 2020 strategy (from 2005 onwards), Hungary’s National Action Plan envisions very serious steps in the field of both energy produced from renewable sources and energy efficiency. The Energy Efficiency Credit Fund (EHA) has been in operation since 1991, and has been lending support to the energy efficiency investments of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Moreover, the Hungarian Government is planning to improve the energy efficiency of the biggest public sector consumers by 60% through the upgrading of public institutions (including the installation of solar collectors and the modernisation of insulation and heating systems) on the basis of the draft Complex Building Energy and Climate Protection Programme. These are great plans, but their implementation has been seriously jeopardised by the financial and economic crisis that continues to this day. Therefore, we must ask the Commission to pay serious attention to national action plans and their implementation, and to ensure that the EU directives adopted thus far are transposed into national legislation, as the implementation of the 2020 energy strategy and the achievement of the CO2 emission reduction targets can depend on this. Other than that, progress in this area can only be expected through the joint application of the appropriate financial instruments and the establishment of a suitable legislative framework.</p>

      <p sl="pl">An increase in energy efficiency contributes directly to an improvement in energy security for the whole of the EU. If changes are introduced properly, they will result in reduced emissions of pollutants. This is definitely a very positive direction for development, which supports our efforts to combat climate change. Using up-to-date technologies in the modernisation of infrastructure will also ensure financial savings and, as a result, economic growth in EU Member States. Thanks to this, as the rapporteur himself emphasises, new jobs will be created not only in urban areas but also in local markets and in the countryside. Of course, all these goals will initially require appropriate resources and investment. However, I think that it is absolutely worth ensuring that Europe has an energy saving, efficient and environmentally-friendly economy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union needs to take action to secure the future of its energy provision and protect its vital energy interests. Energy efficiency measures play a crucial role in achieving this by guaranteeing that the climate and energy targets set are achieved at the lowest possible cost. I think that wide-ranging consultations need to be initiated with local and regional representatives in order to set out well defined guidelines on energy efficiency and support must be provided in devising projects and ensuring access to the EUR 9 billion made available by the Commission via the cohesion policy. The smart use of these funds will enable us to achieve the 20% energy efficiency target, which will help, to a large degree, to meet the European Union’s objectives on sustainability and competitiveness. Furthermore, decreasing consumption through energy efficiency is the most sustainable way of reducing dependency on fossil fuels and will bring about a significant drop in imports (approximately 25-26%).</p>

      <p sl="hu">Concerning the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, one of the most effective means of reducing emissions of CO2 and other gases is energy efficiency. It also has enormous benefits in the fields of job creation and economic growth. Since the adoption of the 2006 Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the economic environment has undergone significant changes. Therefore, I definitely consider the revision of EU energy efficiency policy, and its alignment with our current priorities, to be a necessary step. I am of the opinion that we should use the document evaluating the results and shortcomings of the 2006 Action Plan as the basis for this evaluation. We must do everything in order to be able to meet the 20% target set out in our Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">While values pertaining to emissions and renewable energy sources are easily measurable, data on energy efficiency are more difficult to calculate. In this, we need the assistance of the Commission. Through the statistical data supplied by the Commission, we will be able to track the changes of our energy policy. It is commonly known that the energy efficiency of buildings also holds considerable opportunities. We must therefore urge the upgrading of our existing buildings, since the proportion of new buildings being constructed is declining. There are numerous buildings, mainly in Central European countries, which, after appropriate renovation, could have serious potential in terms of efficiency. As regards legislative measures in support of energy efficient solutions, the US and China are far ahead of us. We must do everything in order to minimise our disadvantage. The European Union and the Member States must support measures and means for increasing financing in this area.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Although the European Union has set targets for reducing energy consumption by 20% by 2020, these are not binding, unlike targets in the areas of reducing emissions and renewables. Member States are therefore not sufficiently motivated to achieve the best possible results in the area of energy efficiency. The technology and the practical processes for improving energy efficiency already exist, but since there will be no binding targets, these projects will not be properly financed and, consequently, will not be implemented. If the EU were to achieve its target by 2020, however, that would mean financial savings of up to EUR 78 billion a year. Apart from reducing dependence on imports of oil and natural gas, thereby boosting energy supply security, this would also mean significant savings for households. I consider this factor to be highly important, because the number of people living in so-called energy poverty, where electricity and gas bills swallow up most of the family budget, is currently growing. If binding targets were set, however, households could save up to EUR 1 000 annually, according to figures from the European Commission. Besides greater competitiveness, improved energy efficiency would also boost the creation of permanent jobs and would lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 780 million tonnes, which is more than is required under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

      <p sl="en">The benefits of reducing energy consumption and dependence in Europe would be, at once, economic, environmental and political. The Energy Efficiency Action Plan therefore has far-reaching implications. I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Environment Committee on the contribution of ICT to energy efficiency, and I know that one of the most important tasks here is to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources into the power supply. Smart grids can help to achieve this, whilst smart metering in households can make us conscious of when we can save energy and so help us to reduce consumption. The Commission needs to focus properly on these two elements in the Action Plan, and the Member States need to give their full support to installing the infrastructure needed to make it happen, if necessary, through public procurement contracts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Energy efficiency (EE) is the most cost-efficient measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through lower energy consumption, we are less dependent on imports of oil and gas and their varying prices. It is of crucial importance to focus investment on energy efficiency and to limit the money we spend on oil and gas imports. That money should create jobs in our SMEs, agriculture, forestry sector and industry. The Commission’s estimates showed that a 20% increase in EE could potentially create as many as a million new jobs in Europe and an average household can save at least EUR 1 000 per year. A lot has been achieved since the last EEAP, but there is no evidence that the target can be met by 2020. New instruments towards boosting energy savings should be introduced at EU and national level with the emphasis on two main areas: renovation of existing buildings and measures to boost financing. Old buildings have the highest efficiency potential and the appropriate financial instruments to utilise that potential are missing. These two issues should be properly addressed in the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan in order to get things moving as desired.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Anja Weisgerber, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directives 71/317/EEC, 71/347/EEC, 71/349/EEC, 74/148/EEC, 75/33/EEC, 76/765/EEC, 76/766/EEC and 86/217/EEC regarding metrology (COM(2008)0801 – C6-0467/2008 – 2008/0227(COD)) (A7-0050/2010).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, those who helped produce this report and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without the constructive and very open collaboration with both the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, it would not be possible to conclude this package tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I am sure you can imagine, I am very satisfied with this result. The repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe. What is interesting in said directives is that they largely became obsolete because they have already been replaced by international standards that represent the latest state of the art. Member State rules and regulations are often rendered obsolete by harmonised European rules and regulations, after all. In this case, European rules and regulations have become superfluous thanks to international stipulations.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to make progress towards our target of having 25% less bureaucracy in Europe by 2012, we need to nail our colours to the mast now. To put it in the words of the Chair of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, Edmund Stoiber, we in Europe must not only purse our lips, we need to whistle loudly. In other words, our words must be followed up by tangible action. When it comes to that action, the devil is often in the detail, however. This directive repealing eight directives relating to metrology has shown this clearly once again. Measuring instruments for cold water meters for non-clean water, alcohol meters, certain weights, tyre pressure gauges and equipment to measure the standard mass of grain or the size of ship tanks have been replaced, in practice, by more modern digital equipment. The outdated equipment is used increasingly rarely and the rules governing such equipment can thus be abolished. There are also no consequences for the functioning of the internal market or for the high standard of consumer protection, which remains of great importance to us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet the Council has been blocking this package for some time. We have managed, however, to reach a reasonable compromise between the Council and Parliament in the informal trialogue, and even to do so at first reading – which is always the exception rather than the rule for us. The substance of that agreement is as follows: one directive – namely that concerning the calibration of ship tanks – is to be repealed immediately, which is to say, with effect from 1 July 2011, while the remaining seven directives will be repealed once the recast version of the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which the Commission is currently working on, has been adopted. The Commission will produce a new proposal for the MID by the end of April 2011. The idea is that the Commission, when reviewing the MID, will also examine whether and, if so, what elements from the old directives should be retained and should therefore be incorporated into the MID to that end. If the Member States provide evidence that certain elements within the seven directives are still necessary, for example, on consumer protection grounds, such as provisions from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles, these sections will be incorporated into the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive. Once the recast version of the MID has been adopted, the remaining directives will be repealed.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a signal that Europe is serious about cutting red tape and that we are eager to create the conditions for sustainable economic growth. I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is doing its bit, in this way, to help cut red tape and to produce better, more streamlined and simpler lawmaking.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me just to conclude with a brief word about the correlation tables. These are the tables that the Member States are supposed to draw up in order to document how they have implemented the directive. In the end, we agreed on a less strict wording in this regard. We fought for stricter wordings in future, however, and we achieved our goal in this regard. The Conference of Presidents will champion this cause accordingly to the Council and the Commission. This represents a success that we have the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs to thank for.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating and thanking Mrs Weisgerber for the in-depth work she has done on an intricate and complicated proposal, which has been at the centre of a long debate; her work has therefore not been easy, and the fact that it has been possible to reach an agreement at first reading shows the rapporteur’s skill in securing a good agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">This decision certainly marks an important stage in the area of simplification and smart regulation. Better regulation must be something that the European institutions increasingly strive for, and the Commission is completely unanimous in wanting to focus on ever better European regulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">As the rapporteur pointed out, this proposal will actually repeal eight obsolete directives relating to six categories of legal measuring instruments, based on the fact that the instruments covered by the directive in question are now obsolete and that corresponding trade is falling. Furthermore, there are no barriers to trade in technically more advanced substitute products, which do not fall within the scope of the directives.</p>
      <p sl="it">In future, Member States may wish to enact national rules. However, this will not create new barriers to trade since there are international standards that already fully regulate these old instruments and most of the more advanced substitute products as well.</p>
      <p sl="it">Pursuant to the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Member States must base their legislation on these international standards. The Treaty on European Union stipulates that Member States must also mutually recognise equivalent products legally sold in another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission therefore welcomes the first-reading compromise between Parliament and the Council, which provides for the repeal of one directive by July 2011 and of the other seven directives by December 2015.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, the Commission emphasises the joint statement made by the three institutions and states its willingness to re-examine the arguments in favour of harmonisation presented during the legislative process. As stated, we will refer to those arguments by the end of April 2011 and, where appropriate, submit the legislative proposal in accordance with the principles of better regulation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the rapporteur’s position in relation to the Commission proposal to repeal eight directives in the field of metrology.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, I welcome the proposal concerning the advisability of giving Member States sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences of a repeal in the context of the review of the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID).</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, while I support the general aims of better regulation and simplification, which are also promoted by the Lisbon Strategy, I think it is imperative to give the Member States the time they need to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty. This situation would actually help ease the concerns expressed by the various Member States about not having a reasonable amount of time to tackle the legal vacuum that a repeal would create.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is therefore an excellent compromise between the position adopted by the Commission, which is in favour of a full repeal of all the directives and against new regulations in this area within the framework of the MID, and the critical positions initially adopted by the Member States with regard to this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Weisgerber for the truly collegial collaboration that we enjoyed. I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that I am far from euphoric about the repeal of these eight directives. There are, in fact, a number of outdated measuring instruments for which the rules and regulations are being abolished, but we have noted in the debates that the devil is in the detail, as you yourself have said. It therefore was not always clear whether this route really was the right one to choose. My group will vote in favour of this compromise in light of the fact that we have obtained an assurance from the Commission that it will examine the idea of properly incorporating these measurement instruments into the European Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which is, of course, being drawn up at the moment, where necessary. This commitment to investigate – this, too, I am assuming – will also be taken very seriously and given earnest consideration. We are voting for the compromise on this condition, well aware that there are still one or two issues that need to be investigated.</p>
      <p sl="de">As for the correlation tables, I would like to say, at this point, that we have now stated that we are ready to accept the mild wording that is currently to be found in this text but that this is one of the last documents in which we have accepted this, as, for us, this really is about European law, which is created once the Member States have given their consent, being truly and properly implemented. We can only check that, however, if we have the information, and we only get the information from these correlation tables. We will continue to work towards that, at all events.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the other colleagues who have contributed to this dossier. Although it had initially appeared to be a very technical dossier, in the end, it was very clear that the political decision would find a solution for this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a need to simplify the acquis communautaire by repealing those directives which contain provisions on means of measurement that are no longer used as a result of technical progress and the use of international standards. The Commission’s approach is reasonable. If the mutual recognition principle ensures free movement and no specific barrier exists, then no further additions are needed and the technical specifications should be adopted by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the repeal of the directive should not lead to any new barriers to free movement or to additional administrative burdens. We also need to ensure that there will be no gaps between the old directives being repealed and the 2004 directive on measuring instruments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, the first reading report adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection enabled the inclusion of provisions on the measuring instruments covered by the directives being repealed in the general Measurements Instruments Directive. The Member States have been given more time to investigate whether the repealing of the directives will lead to legal uncertainty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report includes a provision that the Commission shall evaluate whether the measuring instruments falling within the scope of the repealed directives need to be included in the scope of the Measurements Instruments Directive. Taking account of the fact that a horizontal decision has also been taken regarding correlation tables, together with other shadow rapporteurs, I propose to support the text agreed at the first reading with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling cooperation. I think I can keep this brief as all the essential points have actually already been addressed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Clearly, our group will support the compromise, but we are also working on the assumption that the Commission will take another critical look at things in the review of the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID). Clearly, we support the fact that this compromise on the correlation tables was found. This compromise has a time limit on it, however, and in future, the Council must react much more strongly. We are no longer prepared to give way. Ultimately, it must also be possible to monitor the Member States and for that, we urgently need correlation tables.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, from the outset, I have personally supported the original Commission proposal to repeal all eight directives without compensation. I believe that the Commission proposal was a prime example of the right way to simplify European law and promote the approach of ‘better regulation’. We should not push for harmonisation in all areas at any price. We should think about other regulatory instruments than just EU regulations, such as international standards, for example. We should also deploy these alternative regulatory instruments in cases where they would be more effective. With the introduction of regulations in the area of metrology, I would prefer a voluntary system of mutual recognition of national regulations, based on international standards, rather than a top-down centralised harmonisation. I am sorry that Parliament, along with certain Member States, does not support this exceptional and liberal approach of the Commission, preferring instead a conservative approach to eliminating excessive regulation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Despite everything, however, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for the effort she has devoted to finding a common compromise solution. I applaud her personal enthusiasm, thanks to which the Commission proposal did not disappear from view, and part of the original intention at least has come through.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of the report on metrology. It is a very technical text and one on which we have been waiting to vote in plenary for months.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report, which sailed through the competent committee, was submitted last March, and the situation has dragged on for so long because an agreement on the associated correlation tables had to be reached within the Council, between the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The real problem is that the European Commission has still not presented the proposal for a directive on measuring instruments, which should supersede the obsolete directives that we are repealing today and regulate this matter once and for all. I wish to criticise the Commission for having reached the stage where it is abolishing the obsolete directives without having presented, at the same time, a proposal to revise the Measuring Instruments Directive. Such behaviour is unjustifiable, and it is a long way from meeting the needs of businesses and citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, I would criticise the excessive fear of those who believe that the law of the Member States is incapable of filling the gap during the vacatio legis . Fortunately, European businesses have a system of international standards for the sector that is independent of, and goes beyond, EU rules. Therefore, the fears of a disaster happening in the period between the promulgation and entry into force of the directives are unfounded.</p>
      <p sl="it">Businesses will fill the legislators’ gaps with their trade organisations, with their skills, with the rules that they have set themselves in order to create a dynamic and balanced market. We must remember our businesses, which continue to operate in Europe with great difficulty. We must stop squeezing them with taxes, red tape and absurd requests.</p>
      <p sl="it">Sometimes, work is done swiftly in Parliament. Common sense and a desire to reach agreements with the other European institutions transcend political divisions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the eight obsolete directives on measuring instruments are not, at first sight, an interesting political topic, but in fact, their repeal represents the concrete fulfilment of the principle of subsidiarity, as well as an effort for ‘better regulation’. In the area of metrology, there are already international agreements which were made necessary by the globalisation of science and trade, and any harmonisation at the European level is therefore really not necessary. I applaud the responsible approach of the rapporteur, Anja Weisgerber, who decided, on the one hand, to support the Commission proposal for a complete repeal of the directives, while leaving time in the case of seven of them for the relevant Member State metrological institutes to perform an analysis of the implications for national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The solution, which we will surely approve tomorrow, will therefore also be an interesting test for other directives, as to whether the mutual recognition of regulations at the national level will be sufficient and will not lead to legal uncertainty, and will therefore be more advantageous than an amendment or full harmonisation. Personally, I would be surprised if Member States gave preference to harmonisation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on achieving full support in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I would like to thank her for negotiating a consistent position with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I want to join in the thanks to Anja Weisgerber who is a stalwart member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and has done a number of these very technical reports with great diligence, and this is a good example of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that when she started on this work, which was soon after the elections last year, we all felt that what appeared at first sight to be a deceptively simple proposal from the Commission to repeal what appeared on the surface to be outdated legislation would probably be dealt with relatively quickly and without much argument.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time that this has taken and the relative complexity of the solution show that deregulation and cutting red tape are nothing like as easy as people think. It is very easy to come up with these facile phrases about deregulation, but in the real world, there are always people who want to keep regulation in place. As soon as this proposal hit the Council, we began to realise some of the deep-seated problems that existed from country to country. There were countries which had problems with measuring the weight of ships, or alcohol meters, or tyre pressure gauges. Everyone had their own particular issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">My conclusion overall is not about the value of the proposal, because in a few months, we will have the alternative proposal which will effectively make this one outdated, and we could almost have waited for that. My appeal to the Commissioner is that the Commission does need to look at its impact assessment and its homework on deregulation proposals much more deeply and get Member States to engage with them before coming up with these proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">On reflection I think we could have spent more time on that had we been allowed to do so. It is a success for the committee, but I would say a qualified success, and we need to learn the lessons from that as we go forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, welcome the rapporteur’s proposals and certainly we are living in a much smaller world than ever before. Interaction between people is far greater, and that is set to continue rapidly into the future, so obviously the more harmonisation we have in measurement instruments, the better. I certainly welcome the repeal of the metrology directives and cutting red tape by 25%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sometimes, I think we underestimate the ability of people to adapt. I saw in my country how easily we adapted from the old pounds, shillings and pence to the euro and cents, and also only in recent years from miles to kilometres in terms of travel and speed limits. This has made life easier for many people and will continue to do so. I think this is a step in the right direction, so congratulations again.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to everyone who spoke during the debate, because it means that there is interest in this proposal for simplification. That is why I wish to emphasise once again the advantages entailed by this choice and, hence, the benefits to be had from it.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am talking here about advantages for consumers, instrument manufacturers and national administrations. I also wish to assure you, in response to the specific issue raised by Mrs Gebhardt, that the Commission is ready to conduct the studies necessary to re-examine the arguments in favour of harmonisation by April 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">In response to Mr Rossi, who criticised the Commission but has now left the Chamber – after making a criticism one would do well to listen to the response, too – there is a joint statement by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on this matter, which reads, and I quote: ‘in accordance with Article 25 of Directive 2004/22/EC on measuring instruments, the Commission is invited, by the European Parliament and by the Council, to report, before 30 April 2011, on the implementation of that directive and to submit, where appropriate, a legislative proposal’. As I said in my speech at the start of the debate, I intend to abide by that statement.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for your commitment and cooperation. Lastly, on the subject of correlation tables, the Commission supports Parliament’s position.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, including my appreciation of their valuable contributions to the debate tonight. After the vote in the morning, we need to shift our focus to the future. Naturally, we are looking forward to seeing how the individual rules and regulations turn out – the Commission has now announced that it will table its proposal for the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) by the end of April. It will then also be possible to check whether any of the individual legislative regimes that we are removing from circulation are to be incorporated.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important, as Mrs Comi also said, that no legal vacuum arises. Mrs Gebhardt, I can tell you that that was also a very important concern for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and it was one that we were able to follow up on. For me, however, it is also important to mention that the Member States are required to document even more strictly why certain aspects or elements should be retained, as it is only in those circumstances that we really need European regulations; they are not an end in themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also looking forward to the Internet consultation that the Commission has announced and which will take place between 6 September and 1 November 2011. The consultation will also involve the companies affected, the authorities and so forth. Once again, I will be listening closely to businesses. When it comes to the existing directive, too, I checked whether these measuring instruments were still in use and, as it happened, the response every single time – for example, from my wine growing association, which I asked about alcohol meters – was that such items of equipment certainly are not used any longer. We therefore need to look very closely into this. If we really do want to make progress towards this target of cutting red tape in Europe by 25% by 2012 – and that, of course, is no longer very far away – we need to make major progress in this area. We, as Parliament, are ready to play a part.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I just have one more thing to say about the correlation tables. I want to state, at this point, that, once again, what we have here is a compromise, but, with regard to the future, I would like to call on the Member States to commit to actually drawing up these tables because this really is about a uniform implementation of the rules and regulations throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in relation to the adoption of the Toys Directive, I would like to point out that, when we adopted the directive, we had an objective in mind, namely, making children’s toys safer, as children, in particular, still growing and developing as they are, have a particularly sensitive reaction to hazardous substances and chemicals. Considering the most up-to-date scientific knowledge at that point, we laid down the strictest requirements anywhere in the world for toys through European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">As every year, this issue comes to the fore in the run-up to Christmas, and for me personally, too, as a mother-to-be, this issue is one that is close to my heart, and I think it is very important that we have the strictest standards. That is why I helped initiate this debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I did so in the light of new expert opinions that have concluded that the strictest limit values for heavy metals are not strict enough, given the latest scientific knowledge. We included a clause in the directive specifically for cases like this, which makes it possible to modify and tighten up the limit values at a later date, and we now need to make use of that clause. Commissioner Tajani, that was something that we also called on your predecessor to do a year ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that, as I understand it, the Commission is to announce today, at least, that the limit values for certain heavy metals are to be tightened up, albeit with a delay from when we called on it to do so and certainly encouraged by the debate today. In general, however, we need to review all hazardous substances, and we should not, therefore, restrict ourselves to the heavy metals. Instead, we need to look into the latest information on the hazardous substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Should it also turn out that it is necessary to amend the limit values in order to protect our children, I call for a rectification of the legislation in this regard, too. At the end of the day, this is about the safety of our children.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, year after year, we have this debate about the safety of toys. Year after year, we have to observe that there is still much that is in need of improvement. We are talking, here, amongst other things, about what are known as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMRs), substances that cause cancer and that may be very hazardous to the health and, in some cases, even the life of children.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new information does indeed show that we need to ensure that the limit values are adapted and we are calling on the Commission to finally do so. Commissioner, I really hope that this will actually happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not the only problem, however. There is another problem in the shape of market supervision, and the Member States, too, have a responsibility here. They have a responsibility to ensure that only toys that truly satisfy the safety standards that we have adopted reach the market. That is not always the case, which is highly regrettable. We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third and final point that I wish to make relates to the marking of toys. Many people wrongly believe that the CE mark is an indicator of safety. It is not, however, as the Commission itself says. It is therefore time, Commissioner, that the Commission gave some thought to how we could issue a European safety mark that is truly reliable and that is monitored by third parties, independent authorities or bodies, so that a dangerous toy simply cannot make it onto the market or into the shops where it can threaten the health of our children. I believe that we have a major debt to discharge in this regard, and there is still much that we need to do, and urgently so.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the safety of toys is a subject of great importance, and not only because it is the time of year when sales of toys increase substantially. It is our duty as the representatives of EU citizens to ensure that we are looking after the best interests of consumers and protecting children.</p>
      <p sl="en">The revised Directive 2009/48/EC is meant to assure consumers that toys sold in the EU fulfil the highest safety requirements worldwide, especially those relating to the use of chemical substances. Market surveillance measures have been reinforced. The documentation which toy manufacturers and importers have to keep available for inspection now has to contain a detailed description of the design and manufacture of the toy, specific information on the components and materials used in the toy as well as an analysis of the hazards that the toy may present.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, concerns are raised by the scientific opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks on the evaluation of the migration limits for chemical elements in toys, which states that the method used to measure the migration of chemical elements is not really reliable. We therefore require clarification of the calculation method chosen to regulate CMR – chemical substances in toys. There is also cause for concern regarding toys designed for children under the age of three. Since this is the most vulnerable age group, toys designed for these children should be tested independently.</p>
      <p sl="en">The latest RAPEX reports also underline problems concerning market surveillance for toys. There are still a large number of toys entering the EU market that pose a high risk to the most vulnerable consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are clear signals that the revised Toy Safety Directive needs to be strengthened in order to assure the highest level of protection for our children. We consider that these issues need to be addressed as soon as possible, making sure that there are no loopholes following the implementation of the revised directive. We need to remain focused on toy safety, market surveillance and the prevention of the use of hazardous substances in products specifically designed for children.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think the importance of the question that we are addressing tonight is the fact that this committee continues to be extremely vigilant about issues related to the safety of toys, as indeed it does on the whole gamut of consumer goods. So we put a huge amount of effort into passing the revised Toys Directive in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">But things do not stop there, and that is why I think it is a welcome opportunity to give you, the Commission, the chance to reassure us that you are keeping a very close eye on developments, on test results, and ensuring that the provisions of the existing legislation and the future legislation will continue to be updated to reflect the growing amount of scientific evidence about potentially hazardous chemicals. And that, of course, includes the need for consistent testing methods. Part of the issue here is that, in many cases, we find that toy manufacturers are faced with difficulties about getting some consistent standards against which to test, and I know that is something that you will address.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I also want to pick up the broader issue because I think, as a number of my colleagues have said, the issue here is not just about the regulation; it is about the whole supply chain for toys, much of which come from outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was recently invited by your colleague, Commissioner Dalli, to represent the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection at a major trilateral summit between the Americans and the Europeans in China to talk about toy safety. And one of the important things that we did there and that the European Commission did – and I give them credit – was to talk to Chinese manufacturers about designing safety into the product from the beginning: the knowledge of those directives. This is nothing to do with marking, it is nothing to do with third-party testing; it is actually the basic principles of transferring information and knowledge so that we get safety designed into the products from the beginning. And then those safe products are sustained in production by proper quality systems, not just for the toy itself, but for all its suppliers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now that is how we ensure safety. It is not going to be about marking. It is about the right regulatory framework, which means getting everybody in the supply chain to understand their responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have a comment that I would like to direct to Mr Harbour. That sounds great, Mr Harbour, but I still think that we have some work to do on our side, too. It cannot be a coincidence that we debate the issue of toy safety in Parliament in the run-up to each Christmas, as we are doing again this year. Just last year, it was the carcinogenic substances in toys known as softening agents that we were debating. Commissioner Verheugen promised us specifically over the last year that there would be new studies and that he would take action where appropriate. These studies have been on the table since the middle of this year. According to the study by SCHER, the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, the limit values for the PAHs – the carcinogenic substances – are too high. The methods of testing, too, are not reliable enough. We need to give this some thought. My questions to the Commissioner are, how will he deal with what he has inherited in this regard and what action will he take as a result of this criticism and in this field?</p>
      <p sl="de">The limit values for heavy metals, too, especially for lead, are ‘no longer appropriate’, to quote another SCHER study. What does that mean for us? If we make adjustments for the heavy metals, will we provide different limit values in the comitology procedure? I call on the Commission to take action in this area, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we are also still awaiting the promised limit values for noise made by toys that is deleterious to health. We were promised these values when we passed the first reading; they should be presented to us soon. I hope that we will have these values soon.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last but not least, I would also like, once again, to come back to the issue of market supervision, as the best directives are only worth as much as their market supervision, which ultimately ensures the monitoring of compliance with the directives, and of course, to the tariff issue. Mr Tajani knows, of course, that we would be happy to collaborate with him in this area. In the shape of Mrs Schaldemose, we have a rapporteur who is looking to bring about further moves in this very area. We will work closely together on this. This will be the next important step, alongside the issue of the limit value for heavy metals and for carcinogens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate in plenary on the safety of toys in the European Union could not have come at a better time than this year, especially in the light of the recent events that have seen countries such as Belgium withdraw various types of puzzle mat from the market because the concentration of formamide, a chemical substance classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction, was high enough to be deemed a risk to children’s health, and other countries, such as France, accordingly step up their market surveillance of these same products.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the moment, we are awaiting notification of the measures taken by the national authorities, and then we will see to it that the data provided are analysed immediately by our scientific committees. If it is confirmed as a result of these tests, as a result of scientific data, that such concentrations of formamide do indeed present a risk to children’s health, then acting under the committee procedure, we will take all the measures necessary to amend the provisions of the directive accordingly. The directive – and here I wish to reassure Mr Harbour – does indeed provide for this mechanism, which means that it can be constantly updated to reflect the latest available scientific data.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Mrs Weisgerber mentioned, the Commission, for example, has already made these amendments for certain chemical substances, such as lead and cadmium, so that their values are in line with the latest scientific data. These amendments will be scrutinised in accordance with the regulatory procedure; hence, Parliament will be fully involved in this work. However, over and above the mechanisms provided for by the committee procedure – and I am addressing Mrs Rühle here – I personally undertake to keep you constantly informed of the progress of the work on these two substances.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the other specific issues raised in the question tabled, I would like to start with the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, which refers to a study conducted by the Joint Research Centre to analyse the methodology used in laboratories to identify traces of heavy metals such as lead in toys. These analyses were carried out in accordance with the EN 71-3 standard.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to the study, 40 laboratories took part in the analysis, 15 of which are bodies notified by the Member States as being qualified to assess the conformity of toys within the meaning of the directive. Only three out of 40 laboratories misinterpreted the results of the analyses. The Commission has sent the results of these studies to the Member States that notified the names of the laboratories and to the laboratories themselves, inviting them to take the appropriate measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">The study in question has also been sent to the European Committee for Standardisation so that it can be incorporated in the review of the EN 71-3 standard, which is currently under way. The aim of the review is to establish a new standard by the deadline set, namely 2013, for applying the new provisions on chemical substances.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the new directive on toys, adopted in May 2009, it is based on a new legislative framework for the marketing of products and it provides for greater market surveillance. The Member States are bound to provide the instruments necessary to ensure that only safe products are accessible to European consumers. They have an obligation both to strengthen border controls and to ensure that their inspectorates monitor effectively products that have already been placed on the European market. Lastly, should the Member States discover any irregularities in toys, they must immediately notify the other countries of this information via RAPEX, the EU rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Harbour, the Commission is cooperating very closely with the Chinese authorities, in particular, with regard to the safety of toys. European and Chinese experts on the subject meet regularly to exchange information on applicable legislation and standards, and on administrative practices, too. The Chinese authorities’ inspectors are receiving training with a view to improving the quality control of products.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards chemical substance limits, Mr Buşoi, it is true that a migration-based method is preferable from a scientific point of view, because it is based on the real risk to which children are exposed. However, setting migration limits means assessing the risk and the exposure to risk, as well as permitting acceptable daily intakes in order to calculate those limits. Given the large number of chemical substances – more than 1 000 – and the lack of sufficient information on all of them, we cannot implement this method with the scientific knowledge we currently possess.</p>
      <p sl="it">That being said, the directive already lays down migration limits for some chemical substances for which scientific information is available and permits, again via the committee procedure, the future introduction of migration limits should further scientific data be made available for other new substances.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Rühle, as regards compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, these substances can be found in various consumer goods and not just in toys. Hence, the possibility of adopting specific measures has now been tested within the framework of the REACH Regulation, which has a broader scope, and this appears to be the most consistent and effective method.</p>
      <p sl="it">Toys intended for use by children under three years of age are subject to stricter rules. Children below that age are more vulnerable and require greater protection. Should there be any doubt about the age group for which a toy is intended, the manufacturer must apply the most rigorous standards. However, there does not appear to be any justification for making all toys subject to the same restrictions as toys intended for babies. The exposure to risk and the way in which those toys are used are not, in fact, the same. Furthermore, certain categories of toys that are intended for older children and for which no risks or accidents have been recorded would end up simply being banned. This method would be disproportionate and would contradict the objective of better regulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new directive also prohibits the use of chemicals classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction, but this Parliament itself decided that an outright ban without any possibility of derogation would have been neither justifiable nor realistic. However, if a substance presents no health risks, because it is inaccessible, say, then it may not be prohibited.</p>
      <p sl="it">Assessments must be carried out on a case by case basis using the scientific information available for each substance. Stricter limits may be adopted under the committee procedure to ensure an adequate level of safety. The Commission will propose this whenever a genuine risk and specific data deem it necessary.</p>
      <p sl="it">As you know, the new directive will apply to economic operators from July 2011. The obligations relating to chemical substances will apply from July 2013. Ensuring that all those concerned – Member States and economic operators – apply the new rules and integrating the necessary adaptations to scientific progress is a priority for the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, the Member States have already met twice to discuss the changes in certain chemical substance-related obligations, in October 2009 and in September of this year. A further meeting is planned in April 2011 to conclude the work.</p>
      <p sl="it">An expert group on chemicals has also been set up to give the Commission guidance. The group already held a meeting in November, which produced good results with regard to defining the issues to be addressed and the options to be suggested. A further meeting is scheduled for January 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Harbour, with regard to market surveillance, I shall have an opportunity to answer your questions at a later date.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Toy Safety Directive marked an important step forward in the protection of children up to 14 years of age. It lays down the essential requirements that toys must meet during manufacture and before being placed on the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European harmonisation bodies drew up harmonised European standards on the basis of the essential requirements: the conformity of toys is assessed and guaranteed by the CE mark, which ensures a high level of safety with respect to international standards. Naturally, I hope that in time, the CE mark can be replaced by microchips. Moreover, I personally believe that the European Union is constantly striving to update its safety tests, adapting them more and more to new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must say that I am puzzled about the need to hold a debate, immediately before Christmas, on a study in which it is stated that the test on the migration limits for chemical elements in toys is non-compliant. Let us not cause a false alarm and disguise it behind the legitimate need to continually update our control systems, because that could also damage the many European businesses that operate in the toy sector and comply with all the rules in force, and it could do so at a crucial time for their production.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that improvements in legislation must always be matched by improvements in its application. While our work here in the European Parliament will continue along the lines of improving the quality of toys, my hope for the new year is that non-European countries will use our standards as a model so as to improve the quality of their products at international level.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, the directive adopted in 2009 was a success because it updates the legislative framework governing the safety of toys. It is a major step in the right direction, because it is showing us which way to go, but it is not sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to be constantly vigilant and alert to ensure that toys that are sold do not endanger the health and safety of children. All toys that are on the market have to comply with current legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must revise and improve the monitoring mechanisms for detecting dangerous toys, due to substances that are considered to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR substances), fragrances, or other dangerous substances, such as heteropolyanion (HPA) compounds.</p>
      <p sl="es">The legislation to follow needs to be clearer regarding minimum age warnings and the dangers arising from inappropriate use. We need to ensure that the recommended age for toys is based on child behaviour studies.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to be capable of adapting our legislation to scientific advances, based on sound studies, and be more rigorous in monitoring the market and toy imports.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to work together, increase cooperation between Member States and rely on the customs services working together to monitor the route taken by imported toys.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europeans are preparing to make their Christmas purchases, and we must guarantee that the products that they buy comply with all the safety requirements.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the recommendation of the Commission’s Scientific Committee regarding the limits for release of the six chemical substances is not unequivocal, and that has led to this question being put. I agree with the six experts who performed the assessment, that they could not clearly prove harm to children from these substances, because in simulating exposure, they use water and not children’s spit containing lactose. We cannot leave parents of young children in doubt over the possible health risks of toys made from synthetic materials, however, and I would therefore like to ask whether the Commission intends to continue its investigation by starting experiments on mice, for example, as was the case when investigating the effects of bisphenol, which is released from baby feeding bottles made from synthetic materials and which will now be banned throughout the EU from March.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to ask two more specific questions. Does the Commission agree with the proposal of the Scientific Committee, which recommends assuming exposure for a child amounting to 50% of the exposure for an adult? Furthermore, in view of the fact that the Scientific Committee recommends reducing the limit for cadmium from 0.5 micrograms per kilo of weight of the child per day to 0.36 micrograms, I would like to ask how the Commission will transfer this conclusion and also the other findings of the Committee into specific measures concerning limits for toys and also other consumer goods. Commissioner, we really would like to know what the timetable is for these measures, so that the parents of young children will know where they stand.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, while listening to the Commissioner talking so knowledgeably about polycyclic hydrocarbons, carcinogens and toxic substances, I thought for a moment that he was a chemist, not a Commissioner. Then I remembered that he is the Commissioner responsible for this issue and, therefore, the first thing he should have done was to reply to us in detail on the CE mark, the issue raised by my fellow Member, Evelyne Gebhardt, the mark which is supposed to be a safety guarantee for the toys which our children play with. Then I realised that he had not replied for a very specific reason: this Friday, it will be two years exactly since the former Commissioner signed a safety agreement with toy retailers and importers in a toy shop outside Brussels. It is eighteen months today since we had a new directive; and yet, here we are again today, like last year, as the Chair quite rightly pointed out, talking about the same subject, the safety of toys, and this year, things are even more serious, because we have a recession and, in a recession, parents who want to buy toys and are short of money will go to the section of the market that sells sub-standard toys. However, sub-standard toys cause three problems: firstly, that section of the market does not know what it is doing; secondly, it has no staff and thirdly, there are no controls, meaning that we still have no protection. As we all know and accept, children are the most valuable thing we have and, as you quite rightly said, Commissioner, they are the most vulnerable members of society. Please reply on the CE mark, which is the safety guarantee. I beg you, Commissioner, to find a practical solution, so that, next year, neither you nor we are here addressing the same question.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the subject of toy safety is important to all families across the European Union. While it is a parent’s duty to ensure the safety of the children they have responsibility for, they need to be secure in the knowledge that the toys their children are playing with are safe. In fact, I have brought some with me this evening just to remind us what some toys look like.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, this easy-osy attitude to toy safety, and the fact that we are here at 11:30 at night to again ask questions about toy safety, does not rest well with me. So what has to be done?</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to know from the Commission which companies directly selling or distributing toys have been successfully prosecuted for misusing the CE marking? On the subject of market surveillance, owing to the austerity measures impacting on many Member States, it is the very organisations that are there to protect consumers which are disappearing, merging with other cash-strapped organisations, and having their funding withdrawn and their powers diminished. At a local level – often the front line in the battle against unsafe toys – budget cuts will impact on the effectiveness of trading standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can the Commission and Council investigate whether these cuts will breach commitments made in the General Product Safety Directive regarding effective resourcing, and what monitoring is being applied to ensure that Member States are protecting children from unsafe toys? To this end, will the Commission be bringing forward any legislation on the common European framework for market surveillance?</p>
      <p sl="en">As in the question tonight, people have acknowledged the job of RAPEX. However, it is resource-constrained and there is more that can be done to exchange information and withdraw dangerous products from the market as quickly as possible. What support is being given to the sharing of best practice between surveillance officers in the European Union? In addition, will the Commission introduce a comprehensive EU-wide database on accident and injury, introducing this in the first instance for children and toy-related harm, so that unsafe products can be removed from the market as soon as is physically possible?</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that in 2011, we will see improved commitment to tackling the problem of unsafe toys on the European market once and for all.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an eternal truth that our future lies in our children. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep them safe from the earliest age, and to ensure that they use high quality toys that do not present a health hazard. However, determination of testing methods is only one aspect of ensuring the safety of toys. What is the most important is compliance with legislation. Comprehensive testing, as well as the application of sanctions with a serious deterrent effect in the case of any irregularities, are particularly important in the case of imported products. We often hear about health hazards in connection with cheap, poor quality toys, which primarily originate from the Far East. As a practising father, I often find that instead of being deterred by more stringent inspections, such paltry products find their way into the hands of our children in increasing numbers and varieties. We must prevent the continued influx of such toys and support the widespread use of toys made from natural materials.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I spoke about this matter last year and, like other speakers, I am here again tonight, another year gone, and that is not good.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Nevertheless, I suppose there is nothing more disconcerting than to see your child getting injured or dying as a result of playing with a toy. We think of this in terms of swallowing something or strangulation, but there is a more covert killer and that is cancer. The evidence is there that cancer is rising amongst young children in particular. Many people feel it is as a result of being exposed to chemicals in children’s toys. PAHs are particularly mentioned and therefore, it is important that we reduce CMR substances in children’s toys to the minimum.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Therefore, we need to take action.</p>
      <p sl="ga">It is time for us to do it and to ensure that the toys used by our children are safe for them.</p>

    <intervention id="2-712" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to point out once again, in response to the many questions asked during the debate, that the directive will apply to economic operators from July 2011 and that the obligations relating to chemical substances will apply from July 2013. During my speech, I said that the application of the new rules by all those concerned was a priority for the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards surveillance, it is clear that strict legislation is not only necessary, but that it must also be applied correctly or else it will never be effective. That is why I am convinced that the Member States have a fundamental role to play; indeed, a toy that enters the internal market in Rotterdam or in Constanţa, Romania, today, may wind up in Bologna, Lisbon or Helsinki tomorrow, without any border controls.</p>
      <p sl="it">What gives consumers peace of mind, more than directives being updated every fortnight, is being able to trust in the rigorousness and proper functioning of market surveillance; in other words, in the fact that, if someone tries to sell unsafe toys, he or she will be punished and the dangerous products withdrawn from the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Obviously, the same argument applies to businesses; those that abide by the rules pay the price for this situation. Indeed, they appreciate the fact that they are not being exposed to unfair competition from those that more or less knowingly sell non-compliant products and toys. In short, the real challenge is to give consumers peace of mind, businesses legal certainty and a level playing field, and market surveillance authorities resources and cooperation mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence, in 2011, the Commission will examine the possibility of developing a multiannual market surveillance programme for identifying the long-term measures to be taken and for making the necessary financial resources available, so as to ensure uniformly rigorous checks and consistent action by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to inform you that, in 2011, I intend to organise an event at Rotterdam port with the Dutch authorities, possibly to coincide with the entry into force of the directive. The idea is to see how the largest port in Europe will go about complying with the new rules laid down by the new directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the CE mark – which was one of the main topics addressed in my hearing before Parliament prior to my appointment, and which was also discussed in my hearings before the Committee on the Internal Market – I would remind you that it does not certify quality; it certifies only conformity to certain standards. Hence, it is a certificate of conformity to standards, not a certificate of quality. As I have said many times, a quality mark is something that we could only envisage in the future.</p>
      <p sl="it">Implementing the CE mark and preventing its misuse – something which unfortunately happens in the case of many products, including non-EU ones – is already a big job. Thus, I believe that we can continue to work on this matter, to develop the CE mark – and I personally am not against discussing the introduction of a quality mark in the future perhaps, but I think it is premature to do so now.</p>
      <p sl="it">As for databases, they will be included in the review of the Product Safety Directive. However, with regard to bisphenol, which is contained in baby feeding bottles, it is not a toy, it is not covered by the directive, but, as the honourable Member pointed out, it has already been withdrawn from the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe I have answered most of the questions put to me. I am grateful to the President and to the MEPs who put questions to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Thousands of new toys come on the market in Europe every year, and Christmas is the time when demand for toys in the shops is at its peak. Therefore, this is a timely issue.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There are significant concerns regarding harmful chemicals found in certain toys. The Commission must address this without delay. Safety standards must be based on reliable methods of testing, and intensive research must be undertaken to ensure that no harmful substances are found in children’s toys.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Although all the toys that appear on the market from 20 July 2011 onwards will have to comply with the new Toy Safety Directive, and although we in Europe have the world’s strictest legislation as regards toy safety, constant care is necessary. The Commission must be vigilant and strengthen the market surveillance of imports.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Every recall of dangerous toys is a cause for concern, and an immediate examination of each case must be made. Consumers must have confidence in the CE mark which guarantees that a product is of EU standard and made from non-toxic materials.</p>
