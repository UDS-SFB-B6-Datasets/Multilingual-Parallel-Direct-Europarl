    <intervention id="4-013-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I may be a bit longer than normal, but Rio was not short either. I would like to start by thanking the Members of the Parliament who, despite many difficulties, decided to join the conference in their personal capacity. I appreciate the exchanges we had during the conference and I am pleased that you can now share your impressions of the complex negotiations with other honourable Members too.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to recognise up front that the Rio+20 outcomes document is less ambitious than what the European Union had planned and wanted. However, after long negotiations, the European Union and its Member States decided to support its adoption as a step in the right direction. There are a number of areas where the European Union would have hoped for a more ambitious outcome. This applies, for instance, to setting concrete timelines for the specific commitments in the priority areas, or to institutional aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, however, the final outcome still remains close to a range of initial objectives of the EU and, more importantly, it provides a basis for further work in the right direction if properly implemented. But this must be done with a sense of urgency, because the planet and the poorest in the world cannot afford any delays. This is why we decided that it is better to have this agreement than no agreement at all. As you know, the challenges are global as are, in many cases, the solutions and we need to continue working with our partners also in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The outcome document acknowledges the important role of an inclusive green economy in achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication. It is recognised as an important tool for achieving sustainable development for all countries. It will enhance our ability to manage natural resources sustainably, increase resource efficiency and reduce waste. It relates to changing the way we consume and produce today to adapt our economies to the boundaries of our planet and to allow future generations to meet their own needs. Overall support for this was confirmed by a number of countries during months of preparations and by positive references to the green economy in the final statements made by most Heads of State, including Heads of State from the majority of the developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The document also recognises the need for broader measures of progress to complement GDP in order to have more solid policy decisions, as well as the importance of corporate sustainable reporting. The outcome document provides the necessary basis to turn these words into actions at various levels. At a time when our society suffers widespread unemployment, we are also satisfied that Rio+20 was given a stronger social angle to sustainable development on matters such as decent work, green jobs and social protection floors, thereby enhancing the linkages between its three dimensions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also contributed actively to highlighting that democracy, human rights, the rule of law, good governance and gender equality and empowerment of women are indispensable to achieve sustainable development. These are the European values we will never back off from. The fact that these concepts have been made more operational at Rio, for instance, in relation to the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, is important progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning civil society and the private sector, the European Union has fought for and secured a good outcome in relation to the fundamental role of civil society and stakeholders in the realisation of sustainable development. We will keep working throughout the next reforms to increase their participation in the decision-making process. In the new UNEP, for instance, we have agreed to ensure the active participation of all relevant stakeholders and to explore new mechanisms to promote transparency and the effective engagement of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to highlight that Rio Principle 10 on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice has been extended at Rio+20 from environmental matters to sustainable development as a whole. The inclusive green economy can bring fundamental changes to progress towards sustainable development because it will change the economic fabric. We have seen enormous engagement by the private sector in Rio. This gives me hope that the top-down endorsement, even if weaker than we wanted, and the strong bottom-up movement, will actually bring about change faster than we could have hoped for.</p>
      <p sl="en">The private sector, if given the direction and framework ensuring public goods, can create investment, prosperity and well-being, decent employment and green jobs and help to promote sharing of know-how and development and diffusion of innovative technology. This will be fundamental to the necessary mobilisation of all means of implementation from all sources. This is the key to moving away from focus on the official development assistance approach alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">This leads us to the means of implementation, and that is also why the European Union has taken the position that first and foremost, each country must take the necessary measures to put in place an enabling environment of domestic policies that is designed to be self-sustaining.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, progress towards sustainable development entails providing the right financial instruments. We repeated our commitment to official development assistance, but order alone is not the answer. Public and private funding and business expertise should go hand in hand in establishing appropriate financing strategies. Innovative sources of financing should be encouraged and emerging economies should take a stronger role proportionate to their evolving international status.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, moving towards more sustainable development also depends on skills, know-how and technology diffusion. In this regard, the European Union research framework programmes are open to all countries, including support for researchers in developing countries. The green economy can also make a real difference in the development and diffusion of green technologies to the countries having most natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the goals, targets and SDGs, t he European Union has made efforts to make the text more operational, including by proposing goals and targets with timelines in several areas, as you know. We have not obtained the timelines we sought, with exceptions such as the commitment to achieve sustainable reduction of marine litter by 2025, but the EU has achieved the integration of most of its proposed targets into the main text in the form of express commitments, for example, on future action concerning extending the protection of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has reinforced the text to make it more action-orientated. These efforts of the European Union to focus attention on key issues such as sustainable energy, water, oceans, land and biodiversity, food security and resource efficiency, should also bear fruit in the next month in the process to develop sustainable development goals or SDGs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The decision at Rio to develop SDGs and make them operational is indeed one of the main outcomes of Rio+20. For the EU, the work on SDGs should be coordinated and coherent with the review process of the Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, without deviating from efforts towards their achievement by 2015. It would be important to have an overarching framework for post-2015 that encompasses the three dimensions of sustainable development with goals that address key challenges in a holistic and coherent way.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the agreement to launch the SDG process also means bringing a fresh impetus to a concept that was shown to be at risk at Rio. I refer to sustainable development taken as a holistic notion. Indeed, at Rio+20, in spite of initial difficulties, we have reaffirmed the need to put together our efforts to eradicate poverty and to secure sustainability within our planetary limits. In retrospect, reaffirming the holistic vision was more important than we initially thought in view of the resistance from many sides to continuing to address these two matters in conjunction.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the institutional framework, overall, we welcome the agreement to reinforce the institutional framework for sustainable development. Rio has reinforced international environmental governance by strengthening and upgrading UNEP. It will now have universal membership and must become our common home to set the global environmental agenda. In this new set-up, a truly global UNEP will have a new authority that will allow it to take actions that were, until now, beyond its reach. We have already started the strategic reflection on this new potential strength. We will, however, continue to work together with our partners towards the creation of a fully-fledged United Nations environmental organisation to allow it to function on an equal footing with other UN organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other institutional reform is the decision to establish a new high-level political forum on sustainable development which will replace the Commission on Sustainable Development. It should allow the regular participation of Heads of State in reviewing the progress of all our commitments. The EU has ensured that it will have most of the functions required and it will be important to make sure that this reform brings real change.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, at Rio we reaffirmed that we share the same planet and that we share the same common responsibility towards future generations. None of the countries and regions present at Rio achieved in full what was wanted initially. This also applies to the European Union, but we have worked together with all the other countries to develop common ground, and it is a fact that the document would be less ambitious and less concrete without hard work and also commitment from many who worked on the side of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rio+20 has not gone as far as most Europeans would have wanted, but the key message today is that we agreed on many useful elements, many more than first reactions would lead us to believe, and this is why we should now focus on implementing them and building on them. The fate of the question of whether Rio+20 was a failure or a success is actually still in our hands. It will depend on what we do with it from this point in time in implementing it in full.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission intends to do the necessary to build on what has been agreed at the highest level. We are looking forward to the European Parliament’s view on how this can be best done, and count on you to keep the ambition and positive energy generated in the run-up to Rio alive in the years to come at international, national and also local levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">The global transition to a sustainable model of development is obviously far from easy, and that was what Rio was actually all about. It demands courage, vision, coherence, trust-building, but also time, which we do not have in abundant quantities, due to the urgency of the challenges we are facing, but that transition is simply inevitable. So, instead of repeating what Rio did not deliver, let us rather join forces, find friends, find partners who share our analysis and also our determination, and start to deliver many of the ideas mentioned in the Rio document, in Europe and also globally. Nobody is actually preventing us from doing so, and time is running on.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, we will hear a lot of people talking about the substance of Rio+20 today. I should mainly like to focus on the following question: why have we been so disappointed? I was in Rio 20 years ago as a young MEP and I would have welcomed the opportunity to attend the Rio+20 conference 20 years later. The committee, in its wisdom, however, decided not to travel and, out of solidarity, I stayed away too. Commissioner, how could it happen that the technicians who were in Rio one week before you had almost signed off on a finished result, while the parliamentarians had no opportunity to intervene in relation to the substance of the agreement? This is what I have been told and this is also what I hear from your office.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also very pleased that the three pillars of the environment, the economy and social affairs are now fundamental components within the United Nations, as this is part and parcel of a socially and environmentally responsible economy. As you have pointed out yourself, Commissioner, we do not have much time left, which is why I am broaching the subject now. We must ensure that what was agreed in Rio, even if it was not very much, is finally put into action.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should then first turn to the question of whether we need to place the UN and our contribution to UN environmental and climate policy on a completely new footing. This is something we have called for in all climate conferences. We need a more efficient target. We do not need other people to tell us how difficult it is to put forward a single opinion when one has 27 Member States. How much more difficult must it be to organise an opinion with 192 countries? That is difficult and absolute unanimity is not possible. That is why we need a different organisational format for these issues, so that those who want to move forward can do so, but under orderly conditions, so that Europe’s competitiveness is not permanently damaged.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, what interests me personally in this question is the fact that we in Europe have a marked tendency to come up with a new dossier every week. The Directorate General for Climate Action has now placed a land use paper on the table. We only have a couple of weeks in which to discuss this. The paper will have a dramatic influence on the way land is managed in Europe. Why, Commissioner, do we not finally take the step of implementing something that was agreed on many years ago? We have directives on plant protection and fertiliser use, we have an erosion protection programme, we have a Habitats Directive for flora and fauna, a Water Framework Directive and a directive on air quality systems. Why not implement these? If we were to do this, we would look a lot better in the eyes of the rest of the world at future conferences.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I do not agree with your optimism; based on what I know, I would call it Rio -20, because we have gone back about 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="it">No binding document, no definition of the future we want, but of course, without Mr Obama, Mr Cameron and Ms Merkel – who alone represent more than 30% of the entire gross domestic product and who were, in fact, in Mexico at the G20 summit – what could have been decided? Only safe ideas for those who want business as usual, such as the green economy, masterfully represented as one of the instruments available in order to achieve sustainable growth, and for the adoption of policies, which should not, however, be subject to rigid rules. The divisions, inconsistencies and injustices will therefore remain and the separation of economic, social and environmental spheres will continue to cause disasters.</p>
      <p sl="it">Yes to recognising climate change, reducing natural disasters, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, and yet nothing concrete – as if to say, the house is burning and we are not doing anything to put out the fire. Other evident sticking points: that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did not become a real environment body and that no High Commissioner was appointed for future generations. What can we do now? Only be aware that interdependence can help us cope with the crisis we are experiencing and therefore that a new governance is absolutely necessary in order to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission could set an example: get the financial institutions responsible for a large part of this crisis around a table and ask them to commit to a plan of growth, inclusion, fairness and development, which respects and protects the environment and people. For its part, Parliament can come up with a universal statement of interdependence and democracy, which also guarantees right of access to natural resources and then ask the biggest States in the world to join in. For once, it would not be up to the young people or banks or large corporations, but the democratically elected representatives to decide the future we want.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank both Commissioner Potočnik and Danish Minister Auken warmly, not only for their dedication and their fighting spirit in Rio, but also for the way in which they cooperated with our informal parliamentary delegation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We had high hopes that Rio+20 would deliver something that we need in this world, but we have to be realistic. The Rio+20 document is a huge disappointment and a huge missed opportunity. What is quite threatening is that the EU was totally isolated in Rio. There were several reasons for this. First of all, the developing world, along with the United States of America, does not want any restrictions on its growth ambitions. Secondly – and I am still not certain whether this is really the case – the EU might have realised too late that the rest of the world considered Rio+20 a social summit instead of a sustainability summit.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I am not only pessimistic about Rio. I felt there was a growing awareness that business as usual will not deliver the growth that countries need, and that greening the economy is a necessity. Even the countries that were deliberately trying to get rid of all ambitions in the final outcome were, at the same time, working on the ground, with organisations like the United Nations Environment Programme, to green their own economies. I think that is a very promising development.</p>
      <p sl="de">Right now, it is important to consider how to move forward. I strongly believe that the EU needs a very pragmatic approach. We have to establish bilateral partnerships with countries that want to green their economy: for example, on trade relations, giving preferential treatment to countries that want to green their economies through our development policy – and it was a good thing that Development Commissioner Piebalgs was present in Rio. This is the type of approach that we need, and I think that, at the multilateral level, the EU can also play a crucial role in pursuit of the sustainable development goals.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, the top-down approach did not work. I think it is time for a much stronger bottom-up approach which includes the business community.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to say how delighted I am that we are having this discussion in this House just a few days after the Earth summit, which, as we have already heard, a number of you attended.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time, I believe, to take stock and, most of all, to look forward. Taking stock is a simple matter: the results of this summit are disappointing. Forty years after the first Earth summit and 20 years after the commitments made in Rio, while we were expecting renewed impetus, a leap forward, the leaders of the international community were treading water. As to the future we want, the promise has not been kept and the commitments have been carried forward to 2015.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union set off for Rio with the ambition of sharing an action programme and we are returning with a work programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Potočnik in particular, as well as the Member States, for the determination they have shown in the negotiations, and for embodying Europe’s ambitions in terms of the ecological transition of our economy, which we defined in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where do we go from here? Now, more than ever before, I am aware of the responsibility resting on our shoulders and the role that the European Union can play in promoting a new model of development to help us recover from the crisis. In Rio, we failed to set an example, and we did not provide any evidence that we were applying and following through with our ambitions in terms of sustainable development in all our European policies. What we now have to do is activate the transition at European level and at the level of the Member States. Without further ado, let us introduce innovative financing and implement the financial transaction tax and the environmental tax. Without further ado, let us initiate our energy transition so as to put an end to fossil fuels. Let us commit to the conservation of our marine and terrestrial resources. Let us get on with it!</p>
      <p sl="fr">This will strengthen the credibility of the European Union and give it greater international weight. It will also enhance the prospects of the international human community for a better future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us resolutely commit ourselves, once again, right here and now, to the work programme adopted in Rio to accelerate change. Above all, let us also reaffirm our ambitions and try to make headway in the next two meetings in 2012: on biodiversity in Hyderabad and on climate in Doha.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Rio Summit reinforced my belief that we need to ensure economic and environmental agendas go hand-in-hand.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can boost sustainable development through trade liberalisation. However, the Commission is putting jobs at risk, both in the EU and in the developing world, because of rigid preferential access rules. Four and a half thousand skilled jobs are at risk across the EU because of restrictions on sugar cane imports.</p>
      <p sl="en">If refiners in Europe fail, the developing countries will not be able to sell raw sugar cane to the EU. In Brazil, sugar cane is providing a solution to economic, environment and even energy problems. During the summit, a test flight took place using jet biofuel derived from sugar cane. The Commission needs to urgently make changes to the sugar regime to ensure competition in the sugar market and to ensure that sugar cane takes off in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik, I have absolutely no doubt about your good intentions, but I think we can all agree that Rio+20 has produced a very disappointing result.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The purpose of the Rio Summit was to make specific agreements and guidelines on sustainable and social development and poverty reduction. Despite the high cost and the fuss, the summit has clearly not worked. Prior to the summit, Parliament emphasised the necessary measures to increase the use of renewable energies and improve energy efficiency worldwide, highlighting that this did not mean nuclear power, because that is not a sustainable source.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Prior to the conference, I also called for much less deforestation, especially in Latin America. The equivalent of 36 football pitches are being cleared of trees every minute worldwide, with much of this activity taking place in Brazil. It is therefore strange than virtually nothing has been agreed on this issue in Rio de Janeiro of all places. If we fail to do that now, then when are we going to do it? The same goes for Europe. The rainforests in Latin America are being cut down in order to grow GMOs for the European market. Europe is thus partly responsible for this importation of soya and ought to curb it. If it did, we could at least then save a couple of football pitches per minute.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Just briefly on gender equality. The UN’s outcome document is completely meaningless. When are we finally going to address gender equality in the context of sustainable development? Millions of women are waiting for an answer. I hope that, in the EU policy, we will simply stick to the ambitious plans we had before and not descend to the level of Rio.</p>

    <intervention id="4-020-000" speaker_id="28252" name="Richard Seeber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Europe has done some sterling work here and I also believe that the assessment you have outlined to us was correct. The assessments made by some NGOs and by a number of speakers here sometimes remind me of the assessment of wishes for the New Year: the more you wish for, the more you seem to have achieved. I believe, however, that what counts is what one has genuinely achieved at the end of the year, rather than what one wishes for and resolves to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we consider the long-term trends of the last 20 years, it is evident that we have achieved quite a lot. That must also be acknowledged. If we consider access to drinking water, we will see that we are almost on the point of achieving our targets, while things do not look too bad for waste water treatment either. Nonetheless, the problem remains of how we can help the developing world and sustain it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that it is also necessary, however, to face up to realities. A great deal has changed in the world in the last 20 years. The countries that were more or less on the threshold of development, for example, China and many of the G77 states, have become very strong. That is why the approach of taking action within the United Nations system is certainly justified. I am not so sure, however, that the upgrading of the United Nations Environment Programme to a fully-fledged UN organisation is really the panacea we seek.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the green economy, I might remind you that we really do seem to be blind in one eye. The point there, too, is that we must involve the private sector on a massive scale, rather than just hoping to achieve success on a top-down basis using the old systems, in other words, development aid. That is why it is so important to take a realistic approach. Europe has achieved a lot here as a driving force, and should remain a driving force. I do not think it is right to start criticising everything at this point.</p>

    <intervention id="4-021-000" speaker_id="34728" name="Matthias Groote" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, we debated the preparations for the Rio+20 conference intensively in our respective bodies within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It must be said however, that, in the final analysis, the result achieved in Rio is fairly unimpressive. Mr Prodi expressed our disappointment in a nutshell, calling it Rio minus 20! Some NGOs described the result the same way. What has been achieved in the conference is really very little indeed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we need to consider whether there is much point holding conferences in this format. We have been through Copenhagen, which was a disaster, and now we have had Rio+20: we are moving from one disappointment to the next. I think that the upgrading of the UN Environment Programme, putting it on an almost equal footing with the WHO, is the right approach, as it will give this organisation more authority and more enforcement powers than was previously the case. This is a very important point.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are going to witness the world’s population grow to 9 billion. We are heading for a catastrophe if things keep going like this. If more and more people live in industrialised nations and want access to energy and if we do not take radical steps to avert this, we shall encounter enormous problems. That is why we need a new development strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">There has been no public debate on this issue, even in advance of Rio. When I consider what we voted on yesterday – ACTA – and the number of e-mails and letters, etc. we received on this issue, then I believe that we also need to move towards a sustainable planet in the digital community too. After all, this world is the only one we have got. We can play our part here by changing our strategy and bringing more people along with us, and then perhaps the Angela Merkels of this world will travel to the next summit and really put their heads together to produce concrete results.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite your efforts, Commissioner, it is abundantly clear that Rio is a failure and that we have even lost valuable time at a time when we are in an established emergency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is truly paradoxical that all the Heads of State or Government who were present – few in number but present nonetheless – recognised the seriousness of the situation and, at the same time, were totally powerless to act. Perhaps more importantly, the lawyers are at the stage of proposing a principle of non-regression in environmental law, while for thirty or forty years we have been pushing, and those very same lawyers have been pushing, for progress in environmental law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is abundantly clear that we cannot remain in this situation and that we need to re-examine our governance at global level. Even if the powers of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) are extended, this programme is not a global environmental organisation. We need an international criminal court dealing exclusively with environmental law to address crimes which may be committed and offences which cannot be tried, and I reaffirm this very solemnly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, you have said a lot about the bottom up approach. It is quite clear that we must find another way of working with civil society, which, in many countries, is the driving force, through a sequence of small operations, behind the change we all need and which safeguards, albeit sometimes modestly, the general interest, so that civil society can be represented in the negotiations, exert its influence, make proposals and take action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to review the whole issue of governance. This will enable us to truly put in place a green economy, to ensure that global trade is not abandoned to total freedom regardless of social and environmental rules and, lastly, it will enable Europe to fully play its role once again. Today, the European Union is regarded as the sick man of the global economy. Well, we must spearhead the green economy and the ability to overcome national egoisms.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for your efforts in Rio de Janeiro and for telling us honestly that Rio simply did not bring about what we had hoped it would.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We can actually conclude that, 20 years ago, it was politics that led the way. Now, however, in 2012, as politicians, we are hopelessly out of touch with the trends and changes we see in society. And, if you are a politician, that is a painful conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nevertheless, we should also critically examine Europe’s role. Did Europe play its hand well in Rio de Janeiro? Firstly, the question: did Europe put forward its ‘green economy’ agenda in a timely way? What do we mean by that? And is it not the case that, for some countries in Europe, a green economy mainly means business as usual, with a little bit of green round the edges, rather than a genuine transition to a new economy, which is how you think about it. However, we all know that Europe is far from being unanimous on that score.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is also Europe’s second problem: credibility. In Rio de Janeiro, we called for a real transition to a new economy. But what are we doing ourselves? Look at how we are trying to get out of this crisis. It is business as usual. Even the Commission is just handing out more money for the construction of new roads in Greece, as if that were the way we are supposed to extricate ourselves from this crisis? That is too narrow an approach!</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, what did we bring to Rio? We asked for the world, but ultimately we had too little to bring. We now have to do two things and they are very simple. To demonstrate ourselves that we really are serious about the green economy and, secondly, to make a real step towards that new economy, in the company of the countries which actually want to achieve it, like Mexico and South Korea, because the new economy can only be a green economy or else there will be nothing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I can do no better than a British newspaper, so I quote: ‘It is always a bad sign when a UN conference ends on time: if anything substantive is at stake, these unwieldy gatherings of 190 governments invariably overrun, only reaching resolution in the early hours of the morning. So it says much about the inconsequentiality of the agreement in Rio that it was finalised even before the meeting began’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that is a pretty fair judgment on the structure of the summit, and I hope its failure will lead to a re-evaluation of the efficacy of these set-piece events. I would ask the Commissioner to take a lead from Parliament and consider the cost to taxpayers of mass attendance. I do, however, welcome one outcome and that is the setting up of the new high-level group. It will meet regularly and, I hope, avoid future dependence on these events, concentrating on true environmental sustainability, without all the social ‘fluffy stuff’ that has been associated with the Rio talks.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to Parliament working closely with Commissioner Potočnik in developing what Mr Gerbrandy so eloquently described as a ‘bottom-up’ approach – an approach that I fully support. If we are disappointed with the outcome for oceans, we have our common fisheries policy. If we are disappointed with the outcome for the environment, we have our land-use policy. Let us use these policies aggressively and make sure that we make a difference.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we saw the same obstacles and contradictions parade through the Rio Summit as at other summits. The most profound of these contradictions has not always been the most visible, but it is certainly the most decisive. The globally dominant economic and social system has shown itself to be incapable of meeting the most basic needs of millions upon millions of human beings and, at the same time, it consumes and degrades the planet’s resources at a faster rate than the planet’s natural ability to replace them. Breakdown is inevitable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Faced with this situation, some think that it is time to pull a rabbit out of the hat. They call it the ‘green economy’. The concept’s lack of definition and ambiguity have catered to all opportunists, including those who say that they want to save the environment without changing the system that degrades and threatens it, those who say that they want to fight hunger and other social ills without addressing their underlying causes. Genuinely sustainable development based on a sustainable relationship between mankind and nature will not be possible without questioning capitalism’s laws and dogmas, however much they would like to paint it green.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must break away from growth that sacrifices natural resources and the workforce, the creative and transformative energy of human beings, for the growing accumulation of profit and the private appropriation of the social wealth produced. We have to safeguard not only natural resources, but also their democratic enjoyment; defend local production, reducing the size of production and consumption cycles; restrict global free trade, which encourages increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions despite their serious economic and social consequences; protect natural terrestrial and marine ecosystems; recover degraded ecosystems, valuing the role they play in carbon cycle regulation; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but through legal means and not through mechanisms that leave these objectives at the whim of market moods.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I will finish, Mr President, by saying that the fight for a healthy planet is inseparable from the fight for a fairer world, for the valuation of workers and for a society where the principles of democracy are placed above the laws of the so-called market economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Rio Summit failed utterly, as did Copenhagen and Cancún before it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to ask why, and the truth is that nobody believes in climate change any more. There has been no global warming for 15 years. Sea levels are not rising significantly. Countries like India, China and the USA will not sacrifice economic progress for speculative and alarmist theories about climate change and our European taxpayers will no longer pay for it.</p>
      <p sl="en">More and more scientists are rejecting the alarmist case. Earlier this week in this Parliament, we heard from Professor Fritz Vahrenholt. Professor Vahrenholt has been, for decades, a German socialist politician and green activist. He has been an environmental regulator and most recently he was CEO of RWE Renewables. But after a lifetime of environmentalism, he has looked again at the facts and concluded that carbon dioxide is not a significant driver of climate change. I commend to colleagues his important book ‘The Cold Sun’.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are told that renewable energy will become cost competitive as the price of fossil fuels rises, but the price of fossil fuels is not rising. New oil finds are coming on-stream. The world is awash with natural gas. The USA and China may soon become net exporters, and beyond shale gas we have methane hydrates which offer more energy than all other known fossil fuel reserves put together.</p>
      <p sl="en">The price of electricity in the USA has halved on the back of shale gas. Natural gas in the USA is one fifth of the price in Germany. How is Europe supposed to compete with those prices?</p>
      <p sl="en">We have voluntarily made decisions on energy which will marginalise and deindustrialise Europe. We are driving energy-intensive businesses with their jobs and investment out of Europe altogether. We are forcing households and pensioners into fuel poverty. We have chosen to impoverish our children and our grandchildren. Future generations will look back at this period with horror and despair and they will never forgive us.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, I would like to thank you for the challenging work that you have done, which will lead to a number of results in the real world, as is evident from the written policy commitments.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In Europe, we are a leader in environmentally friendly technologies. We are a leader in the field of clean technologies and a leader in renewable energy sources. In Europe, we are leading by example – that is, the example we are setting by raising the awareness of 500 million Europeans about sustainability, a healthy environment and a healthy lifestyle.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Our challenge is how to promote further research and how to apply that philosophy in real life. A lot of what is a matter of course for us is very much more remote for others. We therefore need to bring our communication in line with that.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is hard to talk in India about a low-carbon society while 500 million people there have no access to electricity. However, what we can talk about are opportunities for solar power plants and renewable energy sources. Though it is hard to say that they should no longer be allowed to use coal, we can talk about the clean technologies that we have mastered and thereby achieve identical objectives.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Today, our attention should be focused primarily on the economic crisis. We cannot saw off the branches that support millions of jobs. The process of restructuring into green jobs will obviously take longer than all of us would like it to.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, we are heading in the right direction and the time for this is ripe. Parliament and Commissioner Potočnik have invested a lot of energy and commitment into ensuring that global political commitment becomes more tangible. The conference in Rio has partially contributed to this. The cheapest and most effective cure for a lack of political commitment is the global awareness of people. Informed people will help speed up political commitments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, in view of the enormous challenges facing nature and the environment, as well as the planet’s ecosystems, it must be admitted that the Rio conference is a missed opportunity. I see the glass as half empty rather than half full because the world continues to be ravaged and we have still failed to identify sufficient specific objectives and schedules or concrete obligations to enable us to change course in favour of sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="de">The shift in power evident in Rio has been remarkable. It is interesting that an emerging economy like Brazil, supported by China and India, should present a document without there being the opportunity to change it. I would have liked to have seen more courage from Europe – acting together with the African Union perhaps – in support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), exerting more pressure so that the UNEP would become a UN organisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">What happens next? Of course we have our hopes. I believe that hopes spring from the grass roots: green cities and green business. The Rio conference hosted more mayors and more CEOs than any previous environmental summit. We should identify the urban environment as a focus area in the seventh EU Environmental Action Programme. The majority of people now live in cities, which is where the greatest amount of energy and most resources are consumed, providing a good starting point. The same applies to progressive enterprises. They have understood that it is only possible to do business when the fundamental structures for commerce are in place. We need to establish an alliance with green business.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in Parliament also need to take action. The UN has established eight major groups: business, urban areas, women, trade unions, etc. Parliaments also need to become more involved, which is why it was a pity that we did not have an official delegation at the conference. We should form a major group at UN conferences under the ‘parliaments’ banner.</p>

To get het up, as Europeans, about the limited achievements of a conference which lasted only a few days would be sheer impudence given the difficulties we face throughout the European Union to find solutions to our problems, whether we are 27 or 17.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For one thing, the achievements are not entirely non-existent and, for another, limited achievements should not, under any circumstances, be used as an excuse for inaction on the part of the European Union. Let us set an example. Let us be creative. Let us begin by remaining faithful to our public development aid commitments. We are far from having fulfilled those commitments. Mitigating the effects of climate change on developing countries requires additional money, over and above traditional official development aid. We are light-years away from meeting this requirement</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must set binding objectives based on stringent sustainable development criteria. Let us be a model of sustainability and an inspiration to other geographical and economic spaces.

If we want to see future progress in the negotiations, we need to prove that the fight against poverty and for sustainable development is the true objective of EU development policy, and we need to do so through the allocation of ambitious financial resources. Let us make a commitment to implement, without delay, innovative financing mechanisms, such as the financial transaction tax, and to redirect a substantial proportion of revenues towards development aid. Let us fight more effectively against tax havens and their hoarding of the fiscal resources of those countries through the excessive use made of them by transnational corporations and, in particular, the extractive industries.</p>

Worse than this, the solutions emerging from Rio aim to overcome the environmental crisis by monetising the environment, through more carbon trading, free emissions bonuses and now also green property assets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner Potočnik spoke here optimistically about the inclusive green economy. How is this possible, though, when this transition would require an investment of 2% of global GDP in 10 key sectors and we know that the United Nations Environment Programme proposes acquiring these resources from the financial sector? It is a recipe for disaster! The proposed response to the environmental crisis caused by the greed of the market, which transforms resources into profit for the few and shortages for the many, is more market. Public policies are replaced by speculative mechanisms, and the common interest by private benefit. There will be no climatic, environmental and social solution without attacking the root of the problem: this economic system that condemns millions to poverty and ravages the planet. Having destroyed the global economy, big money is now being handed the planet. You do not put out a fire with petrol and you do not save the planet by selling it off bit by bit.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, let us be honest, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very sparse agreement. Despite its 53 pages, we have very little news to report: we encourage, we emphasise, we underline, we reaffirm. What this basically comes down to is that we are calling on ourselves to finally do what we actually agreed to do years ago.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Two years after the first major UN conference in Stockholm in 1972, a Dutch poet wrote: ‘All things of value are defenceless’. And now, almost 40 years down the line, we have to conclude that sustainability, environment and social rights are still not being given enough attention in our global economic system. Obviously, some steps have been taken, as the Commissioner has said, for example, in the area of marine environment. However, what will really make a difference now is the readiness to translate vague words into concrete actions. Ladies and gentlemen, some of you will not want to hear this, but the business world also has a role to play here, for example, in developing and drawing up ambitious sustainability criteria.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, the European Union should take the lead in translating these rather vague words into concrete actions. But, it should do it in such a way that we can spur the rest of the world into action. We have to do this internationally because, for example, our debate on whether we in Europe should move from 20% to 30% CO2 emissions, now that difference equals 1.7 days’ emissions in China. So, let us deploy our efforts internationally! I wish the European Commission every success in that respect, as I do indeed to us, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Since I have about a minute left, may I remind Mr Helmer, who has, of course, already left, that the UK Government has had to adapt its plan that protects London against floods with the Thames barrier. I come from a country that saw a big flood in 1953 in which thousands of people died. I wish for the United Kingdom that the same does not happen to them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Sea water levels are rising and my country and Mr Helmer’s country have to protect themselves against the North Sea, but I am afraid that Mr Helmer’s party will only recognise climate change by the time that more than one million people in the London area have wet feet.</p>

      <p sl="en">If governments failed in Rio to agree the level of ambition we would have liked them to achieve, it is true that people see that businesses did arrive at this level of ambition. Condemning the weak wording of this agreement from the Earth summit in Rio often makes us blind as to what has been achieved. We all wanted more in Rio, but it is not true that nothing has been achieved. Let us implement what has been agreed. In my view, it is often better to have a weak agreement which is fully implemented, than a wonderful agreement which is not.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, let us fulfil those obligations. We have many opportunities to do so. Let us fulfil the obligation on the oceans. Let us make the world environment organisation a reality. Let us build on the momentum that has been built globally, moving beyond GDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of roadless areas, for the first time in the framework of these Earth summits, we had a presentation by two global satellite mapping tools on the world’s roadless areas. They were mapped by Google Maps and Eye On Earth. It presented the fact that the best way to protect an area is to keep it roadless. If you want to connect people within a protected area, there are other ways to do so other than by roads e.g. railways and waterways.</p>

I remember Rio 20 years ago when it inspired all of us to get to grips with the problems at local level. I believe we are back at that stage again. We cannot wait for global leaders to stop listening to businesses and suddenly start to act quickly enough. We can only overcome the challenges that we are facing if we start from the bottom and work upwards – for people in their everyday lives to start to treat our planet and our economy differently.</p>

Green growth is an illusion based on completely unrealistic ideas of the efficient use of resources. It is totally impossible to achieve. We therefore need a different economy that is genuinely green.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the severity of the problem to be solved, many, including the Members of the European Parliament, expected much more from the United Nations conference on sustainable development. The alarming consequences of the unsustainable exploitation of our planet are known to us all, while the necessary technology and knowledge is available to reverse the process. Unfortunately there is still a lack of political will, and action is frequently taken in fits and starts. Therefore, the implementation of the fine-sounding goals adopted in Rio remains our joint responsibility. In this respect, plenty of work lies ahead of us.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The President of Hungary, János Áder, my predecessor in the European Parliament, represented Hungary at the Rio+20 conference and made the following remark: sustainable development is about us and our children, our lives and our future prospects. While it is a commonplace that water is the source of life and mankind’s greatest treasure, it is astonishing that according to the prognoses of the United Nations, by 2025, two-thirds of the Earth’s population will face continuous water supply problems. That is a shocking figure. Ladies and gentlemen, imagine a situation in which tens and hundreds of millions of children do not have access to drinking water, causing the Earth’s child mortality rates to worsen further. We cannot be so irresponsible. I believe that politicians and economic leaders need to take immediate action in this field.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is a shocking figure that today, half of the world’s hospital beds are occupied by people who have fallen ill because of poor quality drinking water, and that annually, almost 2 million children under five die because of problems with drinking water supply and sewage treatment, not to mention the people, primarily in the developing world, who do not even reach hospital in order to receive hospital care. They die without even featuring in the statistics.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union recognised the strategic importance of water early on and is leading the way towards sustainable water management. The European Union, however, cannot solve the global problems of water supply alone. That is precisely why it is in our basic interest for effective international cooperation to be established in the field of water policy, before a lack of water prompts migration waves and we are threatened by wars waged for water. Think of Mad Max, the film made by George Miller in 1979. I would not like my children to grow up in such a world, which is why I believe that we are running out of time and we all need to take action.</p>

      <p sl="nl">There is another thing that is also clear, namely, the fact that if an agenda is about everything – because the agenda in Rio was very broad – then, in fact, it will ultimately be about nothing. We can see that in this summit’s conclusions.</p>

What we see now is only the tip of the iceberg, because a lot of small parts have been found in fish and birds. According to the outcome document, we need to achieve a significant reduction by 2025 and we need to take action. Can you make this more specific? Who is going to do what, when and how much will it cost? Are agreements going to be reached about the banning of free plastic bags or bottles? And if we want to lead by example, when is Europe going to do that?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Two more things. I have another question for you. Natural resources are mainly used for industry, energy and meat production. The outcome document is totally silent on the impact of our meat consumption and production, while increasing meat consumption is placing heavy demands on resources and on land, and rainforests are being cleared because growing animal feed requires huge areas of land. What proposals have you put forward to address this?</p>

For that matter, I think that we should also consider how we can boost our economy by means of such high standards so that we can again create jobs in Europe.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, the first United Nations conference on the environment and sustainable development was held in my home city of Stockholm. That was 40 years ago and a great deal has happened since then. For example, there is very broad knowledge and awareness with regard to the environment and sustainable development today. Mr Helmer of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is entirely alone in his views; the majority of other people are aware that major events are happening in the area of the environment that we need to address.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The problem is that the measures we have decided on hitherto at international or national level have not been able to hold back the rapid changes, given the continually increasing environmental and climate-forcing stresses. Many people are disappointed by the Rio Summit, and therefore I would ask the question: what did we actually believe would happen? Do we believe that it is possible to create political pressure in connection with long-term issues of survival when the economic crisis is forcing so many people to worry about how they are going to keep body and soul together in the short term? Did we really believe that this was possible?</p>
      <p sl="sv">For this reason, I believe that the Rio Summit was a wake-up call, because it clearly linked issues of social justice with climate and environmental issues, and that is something that we need to bear in mind in our ongoing work.

He is part of a growing minority who say that there is no such thing as climate change; that nothing has changed and that there is no need to take any steps in order to rectify the situation. What world does he live in?</p>
      <p sl="en">We have floods where we never had floods before. We have tornadoes where we never had tornadoes before. We have storms where we never had storms before. We have earthquakes. The ice caps are melting and, at the same time, Mr Helmer and his UKIP colleagues – as always – are running from reality and are whistling past the graveyard; and the graveyard is there to see. We have a problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ten years ago, we had the 1992 Earth summit. If you look at the statistics in the meantime, global emissions have risen by 48%, 300 million hectares of forests have been cleared and the population of the world has increased by 1.6 billion people. Despite a reduction in poverty, one in six people are malnourished.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with the Commissioner, he has a very difficult job. There are conflicting commercial interests. Countries are looking to themselves and their own selfish independent interests rather than looking at the bigger question: that is, the global question.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I wish you well, Commissioner. I know there has been much criticism but I think this is a step forward and I know that you have then necessary ability, the will, the commitment and the determination to ensure that you will be the Commissioner that will get universal agreement in relation to how we go forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when assessing the outcome of the Rio+20 conference on sustainable development, there is not much place for optimism. It is more than clear that the austerity measures implied by the current economic crisis are being matched by a recession in human rights and ambitious environmental policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The outcome document does recognise the importance of the green economy and stresses a number of vital issues, such as the need to improve gender equality and engage civil society. However, the overall commitments are worryingly minimal and disappointing, not least in terms of lacking a timeframe for the implementation of the objectives. In this respect, the outcome document can hardly be seen as an instrument for the achievement of a green and socially inclusive economy and for growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, it is highly regrettable that while the participating countries recognise the need to integrate reproductive health into national strategies, the language of reproductive rights was not expressed in the outcome document. In short, there is some limited added value in the 700-plus commitments voiced at the conference, but they do not translate into a concrete action plan.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I truly feel that we have lost ground as a result of this summit. It could be said that it was not Rio+20 but Rio-20. The mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse, with a text devoid of clear-cut commitments, which reveals behind the scenes that we are not in control of the new international balances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With the absence of Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Vladimir Putin, the disappointment was even worse than the bother. The fiasco of Copenhagen on climate change is back to haunt us. The green economy, which was a central theme of the conference, was reduced to its simplest expression. However, that was only to expected at a time of economic and ecological crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union was unconvincing. It once again found itself marginalised with regard to the BRIC countries. How can our voice continue to be heard when we are competing with young nations hungry for economic growth? How can we set an example to those who do not wish to follow it? With the best will in the world, are many European companies concerned about what method to choose for the transition to the green economy when the imperative issue for them is to fill their order books and to preserve the jobs that are left? It is impossible to negotiate this kind of agreement in an economic context which continues to send us very bad signals. How can we think of the future when the present is uncertain?</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we must not give up the fight; as the Commissioner rightly said, the clock is ticking. The real issue today is the ability of Europe to lead the way in these climate negotiations because we have the right answers. Unfortunately, these negotiations have brought to the fore the failure of the strategy of the European Union. This summit has demonstrated the paralysis of the process. To obtain unanimity among so many countries is a challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must therefore contemplate reforming the functioning of this system and imagine other avenues of negotiation; urgent action is needed to prevent a tragedy for future generations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as one of the MEPs in Rio, I would like to join with colleagues who were there to thank personally Commissioner Potočnik and, despite all the shortcomings, to say how proud we were of the position he took on behalf of us all in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">He understands that my main role at the summit was to press the case for mandatory sustainability reporting by business. Again, paragraph 47 of the summit’s conclusions represented only a limited success. I made the case for voluntary calls for business to report. Ten years ago, in paragraph 17 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, the European Commission itself did so in 2002, as did the G8 countries in 2007, but since then, we have seen perhaps only 6 000 of the world’s 80 000 multinational companies begin to report. We have to do more, more quickly, and the experience of Denmark, Sweden, South Africa and others is that regulation is an essential part of enabling us to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strength of paragraph 47 is that it names governments and the UN itself in calling for action on corporate sustainability reporting. It specifically uses the concept of integration and seeks to build on not duplicating existing frameworks. I would specifically name the Global Reporting Initiative and the International Integrated Reporting Council in this respect. I am proud that Denmark and France have joined the Friends of Paragraph 47 as governments in taking this forward. I hope that in his reply, Commissioner Potočnik will express his support for his colleague, Commissioner Barnier, in bringing forward regulation at European level on binding corporate sustainability reporting.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the Rio Summit was indeed a huge disappointment. Many observers, perhaps the majority in fact, said that the money for this major summit could have been saved because the results were already a foregone conclusion and were not very far-reaching.</p>
      <p sl="de">To this extent at least, it could be claimed that we did everything by the book. In view of the high costs facing us, the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety decided to withdraw its delegation and not to travel. I believe, however, that we cannot just sit back and relax. We need to learn lessons and to make sure that things are handled differently the next time around. First, this means, in practical terms, that we need to investigate how we can participate in events like this without placing an excessive burden on the taxpayer. Secondly, and much more importantly, we need to organise the process more efficiently, so that we do not have another disappointment like this time. Thirdly, we will have to do our homework. It is true that the European Union has already achieved a great deal in terms of sustainable development, which is something we should also be proud of. However, problems also exist.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the problems in relation to emissions trading. We currently have a much lower price than envisaged in 2008, when we accepted reformed emissions trading. As a result, investors do not have sufficient incentives to invest in low carbon technology. The Member States also have less revenue to pay for the changeover to a green economy, because the income from the emissions trade was to be used for this purpose. We will also have less income to pay for international environmental policies if emissions trading does not work. That is why we need a solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament adopted the Davis report with a large majority and, during the negotiations in relation to the Energy Efficiency Directive, we also pressed for a reform in emissions trading. The Commission issued us with a declaration. I would ask the Commissioner to pass this declaration on to all the other commissioners, as it must be upheld. It states that we urgently need a solution – a revised approach to the auctioning of allowances. I hear that the lobbyists are currently working very hard against this, looking for a postponement. Commissioner, I am a doctor by profession, and I can tell you it would be a pretty terrible doctor who first told his patient that he is an emergency case and then blithely took off on holiday. Accordingly, we need to address this problem before the summer recess.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, François Hollande summarised the disappointing outcome of the summit well by stating that it fell far short of our responsibilities and our expectations. It was indeed possible to adopt an outcome document. However, the future that we want contains little innovation and does not set new binding international targets. Approving a framework programme for the next 10 years signifies that the current problems will continue for another decade and that there will be no fight against global warming, desertification and the destruction of various ecosystems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commissioner spoke of progress with regard to women’s rights, but there have been regressions in this area. The replacement of reproductive rights with reproductive health is an unacceptable concession to the Vatican, which has been criticised by various policy makers, including Hillary Clinton and the former Prime Minister of Norway. Policy makers lacked the courage and ambition required for us to leave our children a habitable Earth.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, like many of my fellow Members, I, too, feel disheartened that the text from Rio does not contain more concrete commitments. We are well aware that we are already living beyond our means. If everyone in the world lived like a Swede, for example, we would consume our planet 3.25 times over. This realisation was clearly not enough, but we must use our resources more efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the past, growth has largely occurred as a result of us having had cheap raw materials and cheap energy, but it will not be possible for that to continue. It is therefore important for us to show that we can break the link between a better standard of living and increased destruction of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is possible to do this even now. We know, for example, that it pays to be more energy efficient, and I believe that it is time for us to show that this is possible. It is possible to have a good life and, at the same time, live in a sustainable way. That is how we can encourage others to follow us on the international stage – not with threats or scaremongering, but by showing that it is genuinely possible and does not need to entail massive social problems. On the contrary, this is the solution to many social problems.</p>

      <p sl="fr">What can we do? There are a number of options that we feel are important. First, we could establish a new form of global environmental governance with the help of NGOs, civil society organisations and trade unions. We could create a global environmental organisation.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, the Rio+20 Summit should have ensured the protection of our planet. Not being ambitious leads to floods, droughts and fires, as have occurred in Valencia, in Spain. This weekend, a fire has consumed more than 50 000 hectares, affected 22 towns, led to the evacuation of 3 000 people, and the death of a pilot. We send his family our condolences.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, thanks are due to Commissioner Potočnik for firmly representing EU policy at the Rio Summit to the greatest extent possible. The question is whether the summit was a success or a failure. Certainly, it cannot be described as a success, though I am not disappointed personally, because I did not expect and we did not have cause to expect great results under the circumstances. Naturally, we will endeavour to maintain our existing enthusiasm, but the question is for how long we will manage to find suitable partners for it, and whether the policy we have pursued so far is sustainable at all in the long term. As Mr Florenz, the rapporteur, remarked, we are running out of time. We need to perform much more effectively and resolutely on the international stage in order to stand a chance to put into practice the little we have achieved. That primarily requires, however, that the Member States and the political groups reach agreement among themselves. We are aware how greatly our opinions differ on the subject of energy policy, which is closely connected to the fight against climate change. Putting the Energy Efficiency Directive into practice and further development of clean and safe nuclear energy can make a significant, positive contribution to the fight against climate change.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the level of dissatisfaction in the wake of the Rio conference is significant. We recognise that Europe cannot force its ideas in relation to environmental policy on the rest of the world. This phase of disillusionment can also be seen as an opportunity, however. Europe can act as a role model. That is my first point. My second point is that we need to focus more on adjusting to the new situation brought about by climate change, as well as working towards climate protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above all, I believe that Europe’s development organisations, research institutions, universities and private enterprises can make a significant contribution; after all, we need to see economic development and environmental policy as two sides of the same coin. Weaker countries will only be able to pursue environmental policies if they also make progress on the economic development front. So, let us press forward with environmental technology. This is something Europe can offer other countries. Perhaps we need to question the idea of greening. Perhaps we should create blue growth that is mainly based on technology. As the world’s population continues to grow, this will only be possible if we see economics and environmental policy as inextricably linked.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, we surely cannot consider the results of the talks in Rio to be any great success. I personally believe it is not to be expected that countries such as China, Brazil, Russia and possibly the US would contribute to our initiative and develop a green policy as intensively as the EU seeks to.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Despite this, I believe that we should focus on getting these countries to join in monitoring and tracking meteorological changes in relation, of course, to industrial production and to the ways in which the environment is polluted. Perhaps when they collect data and information more intensively, we will reach a joint conclusion as to the changes and the measures that must be adopted first and foremost so that we can stop climate change.</p>
      <p sl="sk">At this stage, I believe it is therefore necessary to focus mainly on getting them more closely involved in gathering data, analysing and reviewing the forecasts, and then perhaps they, too, will conclude that certain policy changes need to be made.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Members for all their interventions. I will not tire you with an assessment of how serious the situation is and so on, because I have said that in this Chamber many times. I also share with many of you the frustration sometimes of not having enough energy and determination to move things forward. To some extent, this reflects the reality not only of the conference which we attended but also of many of the decisions we are taking in our daily lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I would like to touch on first, which many of you have commented on, is the process itself. The process did not start in Rio; I could say it did not even finish there. It started a year ago, in New York, negotiations were long and tiring, and there were many sessions, so basically what happened in Rio was the final stage when the host country, Brazil, took the process into its hands. The way they handled it is, of course, their decision and it is true, as some have said, that it was decided before the majority of the Ministers, especially the leaders of the countries, arrived.</p>
      <p sl="en">That does not make it true that it was the technical experts who decided. That is not true, because they were the ones who were consulting their capitals at every turn, but it is true that some of the work we had invested in preparing good strong partnerships prior to the meeting could not materialise at the meeting because there was simply no chance for us to meet with many of the delegations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whether we played our cards well or not, as you said, Mr Eickhout, is something I shall have to review some time over the summer, but it is true that when we have to be critical of ourselves, we always lose too much time in defining our own positions and do not have enough time to share those positions with our partners. That has been a weak link in the European Union approach at all the conferences which I have attended. I personally believe that what we reached in Rio was as far as one could go and that we have to understand that not everybody thinks the way we do in the European Union, that they have different interests, different views on development.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can tell you that when I visited Brazil, for example, a few months before the conference, the discussion I had about the concept of the green economy, which is pretty well understood here, is far from a concept which everybody would stand behind. I think acknowledging that concept in the paper, in as black-and-white a form as it appears today, was quite a major achievement – provided, of course, that the next steps, which should follow, ultimately materialise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you mentioned that the leaders – or some of them – were not present. Quite a lot actually were present. I would just like to remind you that the presence of leaders does not guarantee success. They were in Copenhagen as you know, while not many of them were in Nagoya or in Durban, where we achieved quite a lot. I think their presence gives an important political message, but, on the other hand, it would not have guaranteed that the document would be more ambitious or would go further than the one which has emerged from the negotiations now.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was mentioned by Mr Gerbrandy that the EU was isolated. It is really an interesting thing to look at the international stage and see that we, who are in the deepest crisis economically and financially, are basically the leaders in the field when it comes to sustainability. That is a fact, and I think it is a fact of which we should be proud, but I would say that we were not as isolated as it looks if you only look at the outcome of the document.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many countries with whom we had spoken before and with whom we are still in contact, who pretty much share our views and objectives. I think it would be really important, after Rio, for us to continue working with them, to deepen our relations, to find the friends, the partnerships which are absolutely necessary if we want to push forward some of the agendas to which we have subscribed here in the document agreed in Rio.</p>
      <p sl="en">One thing which I find is really a major breakthrough in the philosophy is the concept of green economics. In many of what I would regard as solid analyses after Rio, this is seen as probably the most major breakthrough and way ahead. Green capital accounting, corporate sustainability reporting beyond GDP: if we focus on that and if we get a solid background on which we can build political decisions, then we can really move things forward. You do not take into account what you do not measure is an absolute fact in politics. I think it is important that we start to focus more on the basics of the green economy, on the fact that we should take natural capital into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the role of business was honestly quite impressive, as was the role of civil society there. I have never seen such power in one place and, believe me, if they invested the money which they invested to be there, they knew why they were investing it. This is an important message from their side also and we should acknowledge that instead of criticising their presence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Working with civil society is, for me, something on which I absolutely have to concentrate in the future. Rio was different from Nagoya, it was different from Durban, it was much broader, and it was different from Rio+20. I would not go as far as saying that Rio+20 was a step backwards. I think that is not a fair assessment. It is a step in the right direction, especially because at Rio 92, the top-down and bottom-up diverged, they went in two different directions. At Rio 2012, actually for the first time, they went together, but we have to work on the top-down, on the political part, where we did not reach as far as we would have wanted to reach.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the means of implementation, at all those conferences, as you know – like it or not – there is a bit of a divide between developed countries and developing countries. Often, developing countries expect more of the carrot and more of the direct development aid. I think again that we should be quite proud of what Europe has done there. We have again committed to 0.7%. I would not like to remind you that we are currently on 0.41% of GDP. The figure of 0.7% by 2005 is a serious additional amount of money because 0.41% is approximately EUR 53 billion. I will leave you to do the calculations, but this was the commitment which was made by all European countries, and I think it is important that we keep that commitment alive.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, with the means of implementation, we have to be clear that there is no public money which could turn countries, including ourselves, from the current economic model to a green economic model. So you need private financing as well as public financing at home. For example, not supporting the paragraph on removing environmentally harmful subsidies, which we were very much pushing for, and requesting more official development aid, does not really make sense. It is not consistent.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, all incentives which you send into the systems need to be consistent. That is why I think we should insist on the broader picture regarding the means of implementation. On UNEP, I can promise you that we will continue working with Africa and ACP countries. Quite a strong power actually emerged and we believe that this is the way in which we should continue. However, in Rio, it was simply impossible to reach that, because there were such clear statements from some strong partners in negotiations that they were not ready to support that in Rio, and that it was impossible to go that far.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, what should we do? I think we should simply continue work in the European Union. We should simply try to identify our partners, use all possible institutions, hooks, conventions and continue our work. Basically, without everybody on board, there will be no green economy. The green economy, by definition, is about economic stakeholders and the business sector. Without them on board, we will not change the reality from the top down. We have to work with them and we have to use the positive powers which evolved there.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we are basically talking about the very essence of the question of changing the production and consumption models. This is absolutely something where you need bottom-up and top-down approaches and where you need practically everybody on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, as I have mentioned already to some friends who were in Rio, I came from Rio not with any kind of bad conscience but, yes, with some bad feelings. In order to conquer those feelings, I think the only way is to work hard in the European Union to deliver what we have committed ourselves to many times. To be honest, I have seen recent opinion polls showing where our public is placing its attention. Even pushing the agenda which we are all subscribed to will not be easy, but we should basically sometimes ‘walk the talk’ ourselves. I think that is the most we can do at the present time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Basically, we should share the responsibility with the rest of the world and build trust. I really feel that this is necessary because, at these big conferences, the real question is always the lack of trust. We should work on that. Even if we have the feeling that we are not reaching as far as we should and that the urgency of the situation is much more pressing than anybody thinks, we should continue working with the rest of the world. We should do so because many of those questions simply have no proper answer if we do not get everybody on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said at the beginning, I do not think that the destiny of the success of Rio has yet been defined but, if we create a strong partnership with your help, I think we can make it better.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Phenomena experienced worldwide in varying forms, such as increasing social dissatisfaction and global climate change, made the Rio+20 Summit of particular importance. It was presumed that the high-level conference would scrutinise the most severe global problems and draw up specific strategies in order to achieve goals not met in the past two decades. However, despite the efforts of many thousands of civil organisations, there is little hope of implementing the outcome document of the summit at the political level. In my view, the outcome document ‘The Future We Want’ merely reaffirmed the earlier agreements, failing to set out new goals and make a commitment to goals. It contains short-term plans at the national level, but fails to take into account the limits of the Earth’s ability to sustain itself. Although the document is a political position statement about sustainability, it is dominated by the paradigm of economic growth. I myself also believe such change needs to be effected at every level with the application of the basic principle of subsidiarity. However, it is crucial for global and international-level decision making to set an example with regard to the necessary changes and to the development of ways to manage the increasing economic, social and environmental challenges appropriately. In that light, the European Parliament, which is endeavouring to restrict the use of resources, urges limitation of the use of all raw material types. I believe that is the only way to reduce the current wasteful consumption in an effective way and limit the unsustainable use of resources and its impact on both the natural environment and human communities.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The EU’s main priority for Rio+20 was the global transition to the green economy, promoting the sustainable management of natural resources and sustainable consumption and production. The EU was particularly disappointed that the host country, Brazil, which had taken over the Presidency from the UN, pushed through the outcome document before the ministers had had time to get there, and decided to strip the text of all its controversial elements. As a result of what was a wretched process of facilitation, the EU was unable to form its coalition, and many of its priorities were not recorded or were entirely ignored.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is common knowledge what I think about the UN’s climate processes. Rio+20 was not a climate conference, but what they have in common is that the processes in their current form achieve nothing meaningful. The decision makers at Rio should have had an opportunity, for example, to use the nine Major Groups – Business and Industry, Children and Youth, Farmers, Indigenous Peoples, and so on – as a resource for determining the content of the outcome document. The disappointed Major Groups, who were prepared to assist the decision makers, marched out of the meeting and dissociated themselves from the section of the opening address that proclaimed that the outcome document had been finalised through consultation with them. The future that they wanted to see was not achieved, for which we can primarily blame the process and the EU’s intrusive marketing strategy for the green economy. The developing countries began to consider the concept to be a conspiracy theory that obstructed their economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I hope that we will implement the EU’s priorities within the Union, and not dash the hopes that civil society had for us. Future generations will need jobs, sustainable forms of energy, the chance to consume sustainably and a voice in decision making. Fortunately, the ‘sustainable development goals’ process was initiated and the initiative on water and sanitation as a human right, as promoted by Finland, was mentioned for the first time in a UN document.</p>

      <p sl="fr">At Rio, we saw NGOs wishing to take the place of democratically legitimised governments. I have my doubts about the functioning of democracy during multilateral negotiations. Associations that promote or that do not exclude abortion as a tool for controlling birth suffered a severe setback through the failure of the demands made throughout the Rio+20 negotiations. It should be noted that the phrase ‘sexual and reproductive health and associated rights’ was, in fact, deleted in the final statement. Yes, there are political issues and human problems that are indeed more urgent than the promotion of abortion around the world. Sustainable development, human progress for all and peace throughout the world will not be achieved without justice for all. Nevertheless, throughout the negotiations, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), Marie Stopes International, the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) and other organisations financed by the EU budget have explicitly established a link between sexual and reproductive health, abortion and sustainable development. Shockingly, these associations would have us believe that the children of the poorest families are children too many for humanity. They did not succeed. I therefore call on the Commission to abide by the outcome of Rio+20 and to stop financing these associations, since their actions no longer enjoy international consensus.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Rio Earth Summit finished over two weeks ago. This was yet another summit that brought no significant results. In the light of the economic problems and the jobs crisis, it is naïve to think that the leaders of China, India or the USA will agree to the European Union’s eco-friendly ideals. At present, under pressure from ecologists and left-leaning politicians, the EU has set itself ambitious emission reduction targets. However, it is not the European Union – which produces only 11% of the greenhouse gases emitted globally – but the countries cited above that are responsible for most of the world’s industrial emissions as well as for the use of natural resources. It is China and the USA that have become the largest oil importers and the most energy-intensive economies. For a long time now, both countries have been resolutely opposed to any attempts at reducing emissions. As a result, the EU stands alone with its ambitious targets. The unilateral restrictions adopted by the European Union are weighing ever more heavily on Member States. Social costs are rising and the competitiveness of the EU economy and the profitability of manufacturing are falling. For this reason, guided by a concern for the natural environment as well as the future of Europe, we should do everything to encourage the international community to continue reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This time, however, without our participation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission submitted by Gabriel Mato Adrover, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the threat posed by chartering to flag state responsibilities under the CITES Convention (O-000127/2012 – B7-0120/2012).</p>

    <intervention id="4-064-000" speaker_id="96936" name="Gabriel Mato Adrover" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I want to clearly express, with the resolution and conviction given to us by the force of reason, the Committee on Fisheries’ unanimous concern when it comes to possible agreements under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) on state responsibility for vessels’ activities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, in the fishing regulations of both the European Union and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), there is an overall principle that is paradigm in the regulation to control fishing activities and the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing: it establishes that the flag state is primarily responsible for controlling its vessels’ activities, wherever they work. Based on this principle, the flag state must, for example, certify that their vessels’ catches conform to legislation. This catch certification is essential to these catches being unloaded in EU ports and being sent to market. However, it is also essential to respect the adopted conservation and fishing management measures, the objective of which is to ultimately bring fish stocks up to sustainable levels for fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">Many states without their own fleet must charter ships from other countries to fish, which is natural, as long as they comply with the legal requirements. That said, Commissioner, you are aware, as we all are, that many of these chartering states have neither the resources, the capacity, nor often the will to control the fishing activities of these vessels. You will agree that, if there is no guarantee of an effective control of fishing activities, it is absolutely impossible to fight against illegal fishing and it is very difficult to aid sustainability, which is the cornerstone of our common fisheries policy (CFP) and the focus of its reform, which we are currently debating in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the latest CITES meeting, the Working Group on Introduction from the Sea discussed the flag state’s responsibility over the species covered by CITES, and proposed to transfer this responsibility to the chartering state for CITES species caught on the high seas. This working group will report to the Standing Committee of the Convention in July 2012 and this committee, in turn, will report to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at the March 2013 meeting, when a definitive decision will be taken.</p>
      <p sl="es">According to my information on the European Union, the Commission held a meeting with the Member States last Monday. During this meeting, the Commission appears to have inexplicably announced that there is no official position, that is, that the Member States are free to adopt whichever position they consider to be most convenient for their interests in the upcoming COP. If this is the case, Commissioner, you can understand that it is both disappointing and discouraging that the Commission has not taken a stand on such a vital issue, particularly during a period when we are reforming the CFP.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have been informed that in the coming days, there will be a meeting between Member States and the Commission itself to adopt a common position. I think that there is still time to rectify the situation and for the Commission to send out a clear and resounding message, preventing the derogation of what has been the basic principle up until now: the flag state’s responsibility. This issue is a lot more important than some irresponsibly believe. If the proposal goes ahead, it will set a precedent that will undoubtedly cause great harm to our fisheries management and to the fight against illegal fishing. The Commission cannot allow all the work undertaken hitherto to be thrown away. It has been a joint effort on two aspects in which Parliament is completely involved and which also involves regional organisations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) itself.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish. Under no circumstances, in my opinion, should the charter state be granted responsibility for controlling their vessels’ activity; this must remain the flag state’s responsibility. This is the unequivocal position of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, and I hope it is also that of the Commission itself. For that reason, I ask if the Commission could explain its position on the issue and how it will ensure that the primary responsibility of the flag state is maintained.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members. I would like firstly to thank Mr Mato Adrover for his question, which raises truly complex but important matters. The question relates, in reality, to two issues: on the one hand, to the latest results of the international negotiations on how the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) should apply to marine specimens caught on the high seas, and, on the other hand, to the need to ensure that the provisions on the chartering of vessels do not undermine the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we have heard, I attended Rio+20 less than two weeks ago. Many have criticised the summit but, in fact, the protection of high-seas biodiversity is an area in which the need for much more progress was universally recognised. The EU has always been at the forefront on this issue, and that will continue to be the case. The Commission believes that multilateral solutions coupled with rigorous enforcement are key instruments here.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is a central player in regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs), which typically cover the majority of commercially traded species, including tuna. The EU will pursue its ambitious policy in those organisations, pressing for the adoption of sound measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks, and for their strict implementation by all the parties. With regard to control, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides that authority over a ship rests with the flag state. All fisheries-specific UN instruments are based on that responsibility. The 2008 IUU Regulation is also based on this principle.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU shows the same level of ambition in relation to multilateral environmental agreements, including CITES, which regulates international trade in endangered species and currently covers 30 000 plant and animal species, among them approximately 100 aquatic species. CITES is widely seen as one of the most effective international agreements in the field of the environment, due notably to its effective compliance mechanisms and its universal coverage.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has no doubt that the European Union should be ready to use international fisheries instruments and CITES in pursuit of one and the same objective – namely, to ensure the long-term conservation of fish stocks on the high seas. This is vital not only for marine biodiversity, but also for fishing operators who depend on healthy stocks for the future of their economic activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Discussions have been taking place over the last 20 years on how CITES should apply to high-seas species. More precisely, the problematic point has been to define the state responsible for issuing the documentation required under CITES to allow trade in those species to take place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been very active in that debate. In line with the UNCLOS rules, the EU has consistently pushed for recognition of the flag state as the one responsible for issuing CITES documentation. In defending that position, we have encountered considerable opposition. Most other parties did not share our views and wanted this role to be assigned to the port state.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where are we now in those discussions? After a long period of stalemate, the question has been intensely debated over the past three years in a specific working group. As a result, we are now close to an agreement. The proposal by the working group provides for flag states to play a central role in issuing the relevant CITES documents, with a derogation under which chartering states may also issue them subject to certain conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the CITES proposal, the principle is that the flag state is responsible for issuing the CITES documentation – including in cases of chartering operations except in certain circumstances, and subject to conditions, under which the chartering country would be in charge of issuing it. This arrangement is a first, as existing RFMO rules do not allow for similar catch documentation to be issued by any authority other than that of the flag state.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new conditions under which chartering countries would be entitled to issue CITES documentation are the following: first, the chartering operations need to be subject to a prior agreement between the chartering country and the flag state; second, this agreement needs to be consistent with the relevant RFMO framework on chartering; and third, it needs to be made available to the CITES secretariat, to the RFMO and to all the parties. In addition, the CITES secretariat would monitor these provisions and report on their implementation at the CITES Standing Committee meetings, thus ensuring proper monitoring and compliance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The specific situation of chartering operations has been the subject of long and detailed discussions in numerous RFMOs and, subsequently, in the CITES working group. The EU traditionally supports a policy in RFMOs whereby it endeavours to restrict chartering practices, to avoid any risk of confusion as to which state is responsible for a given activity by a given ship at a given moment in time. However, it has also accepted that within some RFMOs, such practices exist, with the flag state remaining fully responsible for issuing catch documentation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU therefore wants to make sure that any solution within CITES is compatible with the EU policy against IUU fishing and is respectful of flag state jurisdiction. The key consideration is to assess whether the safeguards contained in the proposal are sufficient in this respect. There was a discussion – which has been mentioned – with the Member States on this sensitive issue earlier this week. That meeting was inconclusive. The Commission is still considering the specific provisions on chartering contained in the proposal and has not yet reached a final conclusion – the only reason for this being the seriousness of the decision which we have to make.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue is on the agenda of the forthcoming CITES Standing Committee meeting on 23-27 July and, subsequently, on the agenda of the Conference of the Parties in March 2013. The issue of chartering will also be raised in various RFMOs in the coming months. The Commission will continue to work towards finalising its assessment in view of those meetings, and it will make sure that Parliament is kept informed about the development of the EU position on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential that the Parties to CITES reach a common understanding on the concept of ‘introduction from the sea’ without undermining the fight against IUU, and the EU will seek to ensure that flag states retain the central responsibility here.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for attending. I hope he can hear me. I can see the Commissioner leaving, which is really depressing, as what he said and the solution he proposed in this notorious compromise he supports so much is a solution that is totally against the principles of the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU).</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why I would have liked the Commissioner to hear this debate. Moreover, the problem is that the Commission is handling all of this in a secretive, clandestine manner. It has been pure chance that some Members of Parliament, such as myself, have found out what has been going on. Neither the Commissioner for the Environment nor the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries have ever been here to raise this issue when they know that the fight against IUU fishing is an absolute priority for us in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to know the reasons behind supporting the interests of countries involved in chartering ships, such as Brazil, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, when the price to pay will be to void Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the objective of which is to combat illegal fishing. It will also weaken the European Union’s position in each and every international forum. That is the way it is. This issue precisely began to unravel in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</p>
      <p sl="es">I also want to emphasise what has already been said, which is that this sets a very serious precedent, because all of this, as he said himself, will now be an issue for debate in all the international forums, especially in the regional fisheries organisations. Coincidentally, this will be discussed in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, given that it is one of the regional fisheries organisations where the most chartering occurs.</p>
      <p sl="es">It should not be forgotten that the philosophy on which the fight against IUU fishing is based is precisely the double safety net of state control over the port and flag state control over worldwide fishing catches. That is what has sown the seeds of panic in the exporting countries, which have suddenly seen the attractive EU market close. That is the root of all these problems. I hope, therefore, that this will be fully resolved by other means.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, flag states assume the responsibility for their vessels’ compliance with international rules and regulations. The International Maritime Organisation conventions to improve maritime security and to protect the environment, the commitments laid down in the Maritime Labour Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation, and the agreements concluded by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations on resource conservation and on the implementation of the international action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing will not be effective if the flag Member States disregard their obligations and do not exercise the jurisdiction and control to which they are obliged.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fishing is essential for flag states. The flag state is responsible for the vessels’ activity, which includes identification, compliance with management measures, declaration of catches, and the development of control and monitoring activities. The European Union’s regulation on illegal fishing is based on this principle.</p>
      <p sl="es">I completely agree with the concern over the information with which, under the CITES framework, the principle of the flag state is being questioned. If this initiative succeeds, it would effectively set a serious precedent that would move to other international fora, such as regional fisheries organisations. The collapse of the relationship between fishing and the flag state will erode the fight against illegal fishing, leading to regulatory arbitrage, less transparency and less control.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, I believe that the Commission should react by making states adopt a common position and defend the compliance of their commitments to flag states.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I fully support the oral question and I want to commend the authors for the initiative.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am strongly against the proposal relating to the practice of chartering which has emanated from the Conference of the Parties to the CITES Convention. Currently, as we know, the flag state has responsibility for controlling the activities of a fishing vessel, no matter where the vessel operates. This includes declaring catches, enforcing management measures and control activities. This is a long-established principle which is enshrined in both international and EU law, including the regulation to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) and the FAO international plan of action to deter IUU fishing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commissioner made reference to international law and the necessity to abide by this, but I understand that international law supports flag ships.</p>
      <p sl="de">The flag ship state has the primary responsibility for preventing, deterring and eliminating IUU fishing. The alternative is that the coastal state that charters the fishing vessel would be responsible. Often, coastal states charter vessels to exploit fisheries, but not in a sustainable way and, of course, to expand fishing activities, so many coastal states lack the will and ability to control illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such a move by CITES is difficult to comprehend and even more difficult to justify and would certainly threaten the sustainability of fish stocks, particularly on the high seas. It is extremely important for the Commission to vigorously oppose the move by CITES and I am aware that the Chair of the Committee on Fisheries has issued an invitation to the Commissioner to attend a meeting of the committee in the near future. While he has not responded today while in the Chamber, I hope he will respond favourably and positively in order that we can have a more in-depth discussion in committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission must adopt a position. There is only one position to adopt and we all know which one that is. The Commissioner says that Parliament will be kept fully informed. It is important that we are kept informed, but it is more important that Parliament’s views, which I believe would be almost unanimous, should be taken into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing was a major step forward globally in the battle against IUU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been working very hard to convince both its Member States and third countries about how to implement the requirements of catch documents signed by the flag states, and some countries have been lobbying extremely hard to have exemptions from this rule, in order to let chartering states have the right to issue catch documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">The concept of ‘chartering state’ does not even exist in international law; on the other hand, the concepts of ‘flag state’ and ‘flag state responsibility’ have been built up through hard work and international negotiations over decades, and now a small exemption, as proposed by the CITES working group, threatens to set a precedent and unravel all the work that has been done up till now.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are all aware that the issue of chartering states is emerging at the speed of lightning in many of the world’s regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs). Far too many countries would immediately use the argument that CITES allows this exemption as an excuse to introduce the same logic in the RFMOs, allowing chartering states to issue catch documents. This would totally undermine the IUU Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I add my voice to those asking what consequences this could have for flag state responsibility in commercial fleets. We should not underestimate this factor. The confusion over who bears responsibility when it comes to oil spills or dumping of toxic waste is already at a maximum with ships owned in one country, flagged to another, operating in a third and landing in a fourth, with a crew and beneficial owners in a fifth.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what is the problem in CITES? It is not clear to me. Is it that a few countries, so-called ‘chartering states’, want to facilitate their administrative burden when they have to issue catch documents on a few hundred tonnes of endangered species of sharks that are on the CITES Annex 2 list? To let them do that, the world should not be ready to unravel international work on tightening the law against IUU – which actually accounts for one fifth of the world’s fish catches.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the risks associated with imposing on flag states the obligations concerning the chartering of vessels that are contained in the CITES convention will create a precedent with an enormous impact on the functioning of the fishing industry. Consideration should be given to the transfer of supervision and controls, as well as responsibility to Member States, who will pass this responsibility on to shipowners.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In no way should the regulations contained in the CITES Convention be undermined. They are of enormous importance for endangered species of flora and fauna and should definitely be upheld. What is concerning is the fact that responsibility is again being transferred to flag states in Member States. It should be noted that, as a result of over-regulation, the entire maritime sector already incurs enormous costs that affect how it operates. The directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the insurance of shipowners for maritime claims, the protocol amending the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of an accident, the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage – these are just a few examples to give an idea of the enormous number of regulations relating to the maritime sector.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The sense of the convention cannot be questioned but attention should also be given to competitiveness and the impact of these regulations on product prices. The European Commission’s objective cannot be to liberalise markets by reducing duty on imported goods while, at the same time, increasing EU regulations that place additional cost burdens on European production. Once again, I call on the Commission to promote European manufacturing and the European labour market through appropriate regulation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, according to previously established practice in fisheries, responsibility for a vessel rests with the country under whose flag it flies. In the case of a chartered vessel, responsibility for the activities of the vessel rests with the state in which the vessel is leased.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Within the framework of updating the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, however, discussion has begun on a fundamental change to this rule, under which responsibility for a chartered vessel would rest with the country in which the vessel is owned.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I admit I have some doubts as to whether states that have contractually chartered a vessel to another state might succeed in monitoring the activities performed by that vessel. I could cite as an example my own country, which is located in the interior of Europe and has no access to the sea, but which owns a marine fleet. Naturally, it has no effective possibility of monitoring these ships, because they are chartered out and operated by other countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It therefore seems to me that by accepting the proposed change to responsibility for the actions of chartered vessels in the convention, we would be creating a legal situation where no one would really be responsible for the activities of chartered vessels.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, neither Ms Damanaki nor Mr Potočnik is present here … No comment …</p>
      <p sl="fr">In European as in international law of the sea, the flag state is responsible for controlling the activities of its fishing vessels as regards vessel registration, fishing authorisations, fishing registers, and, in particular, catch certificates. It is, in fact, the responsibility of the flag state to provide accurate information about the legality of their catches and to have this information validated by their flag state.</p>
      <p sl="fr">EU legislation on the issuance of export certificates is clear. Products cannot be imported unless they have a catch certificate attesting to their legality. This certificate is issued by the flag state of the fishing vessels that have caught the fish concerned in line with its duty under international law. In short, international law requires the flag state to comply with international rules on conservation and management of fisheries resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has prepared a dangerous text for all those working in the fisheries sector under the external aspects of the common fisheries policy. Were it to be adopted, this text would enable the state chartering the vessel, and not the flag state, to be responsible for the vessel’s activities. The chartering state would also be able to issue export certificates even though it does not have the resources to control the legality of the products transported. In reality, the majority of chartering states do not have the financial or technical resources to control fishing activities</p>
      <p sl="fr">This text could therefore set a dangerous precedent, leaving a legal loophole in EU law. The EU’s regulation to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is based solely on the responsibilities of the flag state, would no longer have any meaning. To give the right to chartering states to sign export certificates would be to open up a loophole in the legislation to combat IUU fishing</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union already imports 70% of the aquaculture and fisheries products it consumes. It must not, in addition, allow products that have been fished illegally and criminally from entering its territory. However, this is the risk we run if the CITES text is adopted. We must not open our doors to products that do not comply with EU health, social and environmental rules.</p>

      <p sl="es">The European Union has defended the role of flag states for years, in the cases of chartered operations on the high seas, in compliance with the regulation on illegal fishing and International Law. The EU must continue to intensify the greatest collaboration possible between flag and chartering states in order to ensure control, monitoring, surveillance and compliance with regulations and in order to conserve our marine ecosystem and fishing sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="es">The current regulation is a good tool with which to achieve those aims. In my opinion, it should be maintained until an agreement is reached at the next working group in March which obliges all states, both flag states and chartering states, to comply with the regulations to ensure that endangered marine species are neither caught nor transported.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are currently aware that the best guarantee for the fight against illegal fishing continues to be that the flag state is responsible for the entire process.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is an extremely complex issue that has caused much debate and discussion within CITES for more than ten years now. We are dealing here with the whole question of who does what when catching fish in international waters and then landing them in a port, particularly in respect of marine species listed in CITES Appendix 2.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year, the CITES Standing Committee came very close to endorsing the recommendations agreed by the working group that flag states should be responsible for export certificates, but, at the last minute, Brazil and the Oceania region brought up the question of chartering and effectively threw a spanner in the works. They wanted special provisions for chartering vessels fishing in areas beyond national jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, the issue was referred to a working group which met recently in the US and, although the majority of countries were in agreement on provisions for chartering vessels with special safeguards, including consultation with our fishery management organisations and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, there was no overall consensus. The issue is now on the agenda for the upcoming Standing Committee of CITES, which is supposed to endorse the text and refer it to the Conference of the Parties next year for adoption.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just when everyone thought that the issue was now closed, the new provision of giving the flag state the responsibility of issuing certificates for marine specimens caught by another flag state, the chartered one, is now being seen as highly risky.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several EU Member States have raised concerns that this would cause conflict with existing provisions for our FMOs as well as with our own regulations to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and would risk creating distortions to the rules of origin. Surely the most important issue here is not to lose sight of the main purpose of CITES.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the proposal to transfer responsibility for vessels and their respective catches from the flag state to the chartering state will inevitably lead to serious problems due to the latter having limited, or even no, ability to control its fishing fleet.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the particular case of fishing vessels operating on the high seas, where the control of the fleet and its catches is even more complex and demanding, that proposal could create the conditions for widespread non-compliance. In this context, it is also important to stress that some of the species affected by this proposal are ocean migratory fish, which means that they tend to be caught by fishing vessels on the high seas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In view of this, and to avoid an unacceptable increase in unreported and unregulated illegal fishing, particularly on the high seas, the Commission should vehemently oppose this proposal, as we are doing here with a consensus that stretches from left to right around this Chamber.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first just spend fifteen seconds to explain why Commissioner Potočnik and Commissioner Damanaki cannot be here at present. It is, of course, not because of a lack of interest, but because, later today, there is the formal takeover of the Cyprus Presidency, and that is being marked in Cyprus where the presence of the whole Commission is needed. So I am on duty today, but I can assure you that if Mr Potočnik had had any chance of staying, he would very much have liked to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Stevenson has just highlighted very clearly how complex this issue is, and I take the point that we should not lose sight of what is at stake here and also how long this matter has been with CITES. That is also the reason why it is so difficult now to formulate a clear-cut position. As Mr Potočnik said, it is still being debated internally in the Commission and between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said that, it is a very timely debate which has been raised today and I thank the people behind the oral question for that, because it is also a reality that the final deadline for the COP is coming up next March, so there is time to fine-tune the EU position on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In finalising the position, several elements will have to be considered. The central role of the flag state has been pointed out very clearly here and I want to recall that this principle has not yet been agreed by all countries: currently, each country goes its own way in CITES. Therefore, the importance of reaching a common interpretation of the concept of introduction from the sea in CITES is indispensable to make it operational for the safeguarding of marine species.</p>
      <p sl="en">These elements need to be put together in the best possible manner in developing the position of the European Union ahead of the COP in March next year in full coherence with our efforts to combat illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I, and also the experts here, will take care that all your considerations, all your concerns are brought back to both Commissioners contributing to the internal deliberations on how to get a strong EU position prior to the March COP next year. So thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to listen to your input to this debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">In fisheries, the flag state is ultimately responsible for the activities of a vessel, including declaring catches, enforcing management measures, control activities, etc. Both the EU’s IUU Regulation to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the FAO guidelines on IUU are based upon this principle. This long-established principle is threatened by the practice of chartering. If a state engaged in fishing on the high seas charters a vessel flying the flag of another state, the flag state and not the chartering state must be responsible for the vessel’s actions.</p>

I would like to make the following non-partisan comments: the European Parliament expressly regrets the fact that the increase in the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, the necessity of which has also been accepted by the Council, has failed simply because the Member States were unable to agree on the Member States from which the extra judges were to be drawn. This is despite the fact that there were several possible solutions on the table.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thus, in procedural terms, we have an absolutely exceptional case here that is almost without precedent in Parliament, as we are about to vote on the proposed regulation and the first part today in order to relieve the Court of Justice of at least some of its workload, while leaving the second part hanging; it will hopefully be possible to bring this more important part to a successful conclusion by summer 2013.

Any large backlog in any part of the EU justice system is obviously highly unwelcome. The fact is that, despite a large increase in the number of cases disposed of annually – i.e. in productivity – the number of pending cases continues to rise year on year, as we have failed to close the gap with the increasing number of new cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was not in support of the Lisbon Treaty, but we now need to buttress it by adjusting to the high judicial case-load that the Treaty seems to have generated. The list of structural reforms, as we have heard, will reduce the restrictions on the composition of the Grand Chamber, allowing holders of the newly created post of Vice-President to sit in the Grand Chamber in lieu of the President, and doing away with the quite excessive requirement that all the Presidents of the five-judge chambers be present there all the time.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, during the 18th century in a sermon preached before his King, Bishop Hoadly of Winchester made the observation that ‘whoever hath an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws, it is he, who is truly the law giver, to all intents and purposes; and not the person who first wrote or spoke them’. Judicial activism is a problem intrinsic in any system which places final interpretative power in a tribunal. It is a system that has been greatly exacerbated in the European Union by two particular phenomena.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, the fact that there is no requirement for the judges at the ECJ to have spent a single day on the bench in their home countries. The only qualification you need in essence is a law degree, so many of them are politicians, officials who have an overt federalist agenda. Secondly, the federalist agenda is in the job description, in the spec of the people who do it. This is the problem with any renegotiation. You have matters which are plainly intergovernmental being reinterpreted as single market issues, as QMV issues by judges with a mission.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is quite shocking actually that there currently exists no workable procedures for replacing a civil service tribunal judge if he or she falls ill. One has to wonder why this was not included in the original statute in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was in favour of the separate civil service tribunal (CST) at the time of its establishment in 2005 and I should like to reiterate my ECR Group’s position that we need more specialised courts on the model of the CST to provide tailored expertise in specific legal areas such as infringements of IP law.

It is, of course, very questionable whether we need to have a growth plan at European level over the next ten years after the clear failure of the Lisbon Agenda. I am sceptical about a deliverable programme that the project bond initiative hopes to represent. However, I have some immediate real concerns and this is why a proper evaluation of the pilot phase is vital at this stage, as the ECR Group has repeatedly made clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">The moribund economies of southern Europe do not necessarily need some gigantic Keynesian investment programme. They need flexible labour markets. The problem is mainly the supply side. Across Europe, as well as at EU level, national and regional governments refuse to cut red tape, the one long-term solution that could lead Europe to the prosperity we now find elusive in a globally competitive world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am nevertheless in favour of infrastructure development as a general principle and, since this initiative may, if well thought through, bring some success, it makes sense to trial it now, with a view to making an evidence-based decision on whether to take it further at a later date.</p>

Firstly, project bonds are a way to place the financing of projects on a broader footing by including private capital. This does not involve an infinite increase in financial capital. Secondly, this means that the projects must make sense and demonstrate economic effectiveness. We need to learn from the past: we are not just talking about building roads and hotel complexes. That is why a test and pilot phase is so important; after all, we should only promise people what we can actually deliver. At present, there are numerous promises and unrealistic expectations associated with these project bonds and a pilot phase would help us to get back on the straight and narrow.</p>

We are in favour of democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion, and I hope that we also want to build lasting peace in the Middle East. In this respect, it was encouraging to see that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) suggested that Hamas should recognise the state of Israel and give its support to a two-state solution, and that it should end its strikes against Israel. They have, of course, intensified in recent times.</p>

In most cases, the solution lies somewhere in the middle, and that is precisely my problem: when I consider the amendment, it seems far too one-sided. The way I see it, the legitimate interests of the Israeli side have been ignored. Let me repeat: it is particularly difficult to distinguish between good and evil here.

The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court judges to 39, is necessary.

Like the judicial reform recently carried out in Hungary, the aim of the draft amendment requested by the Court of Justice is to increase the efficiency of the Court of Justice and to reduce the duration of proceedings. It is not sufficient to stem the tide of new cases; it is also necessary to take strong steps to process the backlog of cases in progress. According to the Court of Justice, the necessary efficiency and consistency of the Court of Justice's administration of justice can only be ensured by increasing the number of judges as a matter of urgency. There is general agreement among the institutions of the EU regarding the necessity of these amendments. However, while there is agreement in theory about increasing the number of members of the General Court, the method of appointing them has not yet been determined. Given that the Council was unable to reach political agreement concerning the distribution of the 12 new judge positions to be created among the Member States, the relevant section was omitted from the regulation, enabling the remaining points of the reform to be adopted and for the organisational changes to come into effect prior to the partial restructuring in autumn.</p>

It is a specialised court and appeals against its decisions may be lodged with the Court of First Instance. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of pending cases that must be dealt with. The current CST Statute does not allow a judge to be replaced during temporary absences on medical grounds, which leads to pending cases accumulating. To remedy this situation, it is proposed that temporary judges be chosen from among former Members of the Court of Justice of the European Union who are able to place themselves at the disposal of the Civil Service Tribunal, to be appointed for a period of four years, after which they may be reappointed. Although I regret that my vote was too late to be included, I voted for this draft amendment to the CST Statute since, by establishing the office of Vice-President and introducing the possibility of replacing a judge absent on medical grounds, the tribunal will not only improve its work, but will help to improve citizens’ quality of life.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Court of Justice has submitted a proposal allowing the appointment of temporary judges to the Civil Service Tribunal of the European Union. The Civil Service Tribunal is made up of seven judges. It follows from this that the operation of the court may be seriously put at risk if any of them falls ill or is incapable of carrying out his duties for some time. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal does not get into a situation where it is unable to perform its judicial role, a proposal has been made for temporary judges to be allowed in specialised tribunals. The essence of the proposal is that, at the suggestion of the President of the Court of Justice, the Council will draw up a list of three people proposed as temporary judges. They will be appointed for a term of four years, with the possibility of reappointment. They will exercise judicial powers only when addressing the cases assigned to them. This means that the temporary judges may only perform a judicial role and may not take part in running the Civil Service Tribunal or electing the President of the Court of Justice or the Presidents of the Chambers. In my opinion, the proposal submitted by the Court of Justice looks like a sensible solution to a practical problem which might otherwise significantly disrupt the activities of the Civil Service Tribunal of the EU.</p>

The backlog of cases in the General Court is increasing: as of 12 October 2011, the number stood at 1 323 cases, compared to 1 304 at the same date in the previous year. It is important that the Court of Justice works effectively, as part of a well-functioning legal system providing clarity and certainty for firms operating in the EU. Under this dossier, the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice will be established, and the rules relating to participation of judges in the Grand Chamber reformed, in order to allow the Court to operate more efficiently. Concerning the Civil Service Tribunal, the possibility of appointing temporary judges has been created, in order to substitute for existing judges who may be unavailable for long periods of time.

      <p sl="pl">Ever since the new Member States acceded to the European Union, the European Court of Justice has been faced with the problem of too few staff in relation to its caseload. The number of cases before the ECJ is steadily increasing and, in 2011, was 11.3% higher than in the previous year. An additional problem is the lack of replacement judges in situations where one of the main judges is on sick leave for a period longer than three months. This results in considerable delays in the Court’s work. Last year, there were as many as 1 323 cases waiting to be heard on 12 October. I therefore support the ECJ’s request for a regulation that would allow temporary judges to sit in the European Union Civil Service Tribunal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present, the Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven judges. The Court has suggested that, at the request of the President of the European Court of Justice, the Council of the European Union should prepare a list of three persons to act as temporary judges for a period of four years, who would be drawn from former ECJ members. Such judges would only have judicial competence over the cases to which they have been allocated. They would not have the right to participate in court administration or in the selection of the Court’s President or chamber presidents. The additional costs incurred by such a solution would be relatively small, as these judges would only receive 1/30 of the salary of a permanent judge for each day of work. I support the Court’s request. The provision of effective legal protection and the possibility of speeding up court proceedings should be a priority for the proper functioning of the European Union, even though this will increase costs in next year’s budget.</p>

To ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is able to perform its work continuously and with the greatest possible efficiency, it has become necessary to amend the Statute of the Court of Justice. The use of substitute judges is a sensible solution to a practical problem that can disrupt the work of the Civil Service Tribunal in the extreme.

National budgets are under considerable pressure, so it is important that we look at new and innovative ways of boosting growth and creating jobs. Crucially, this initiative does not make any additional demands on domestic budgets, sovereign debt or contingent liability. It does rely on redirecting EUR 230 million from existing EU programmes to the EIB, to leverage a total investment of EUR 4.5 billion. It is better to use private finance productively rather than have it end up in speculative markets. Should the pilot project prove successful, this type of financial instrument could be used more widely in the future. I welcome the fact that the Parliament and the Council have agreed on the re-investment of any revenues generated into the mechanism itself, on a clear role for MEPs in monitoring implementation, as well as a full independent evaluation of the pilot phase in 2015.

Implementing connecting trans-European infrastructure is of key importance strategically and therefore lends itself extremely well to testing the issuance of bonds intended to finance infrastructure projects.

A number of large-scale infrastructure projects demanding enormous levels of funding are now seriously compromised, in the context of the huge transfers of public resources that have been undertaken to fill the holes in the financial system and an outlook of restrictive financial policy, with limited credit and an increased risk of default, for some years to come. The underlying logic of these large-scale projects is not to benefit the countries and their people, however, which would first require a break with the current policies of pillage and exploitation. This proposal’s sole concern, in truth, is the large-scale projects, those that fundamentally involve the German or French big businesses that dominate the transport, energy and telecommunication sectors. It is significant that investment in smaller-scale infrastructure is purely and simply ignored, although this is extremely important since it allows greater integration of national production and provides incentives to those small and medium-sized enterprises that supply it, thereby creating jobs. In addition, the proposal maintains all of the dogmas associated with current policy: budgetary control, deficit reduction and austerity. These long-term bonds are nothing more than public investment to reduce private risk and, hence, increase private profit.</p>

In its resolutions of June 2011 on ‘Investing in the future: a new multiannual financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe’, the European Parliament emphasised that the Union should adopt measures, above all, for improving the use of EU resources as a catalyst attracting further funds from the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, other international financial institutions and the private sector. Financial instruments can improve the efficiency of budget spending and achieve high multiplier effects in terms of attracting private sector financing and achieved investment volumes. The Europe 2020 project bond initiative has a twofold objective. First, to help finance projects of European policy priorities, and, second, to facilitate greater private sector involvement in the long-term capital market financing of infrastructure projects. In my opinion, the Union support should mitigate the risk inherent in project bonds to the extent that capital market participants are willing to invest in a larger volume of infrastructure project bonds than would be possible without Union support.</p>

Implementation of the planned projects will enable citizens to perceive the benefit of European integration in a concrete way, thereby strengthening the European idea. However, this instrument also carries risks, primarily associated with assuming losses that may potentially be suffered in the course of the planned investment projects. While the upper limit for assumption of risk regarding the EU budget is clearly defined in the legislative proposal of the European Commission, the situation is different where the European Investment Bank (EIB) is concerned. Based on the EIB and the investors concluding a contract for each individual project and the EIB drawing up an overall risk sharing plan covering all projects, it is assumed that the EIB does not need to assume further risks. We therefore need to avoid at all costs a situation where the materialisation of risks has a negative impact on the EIB’s creditworthiness and reputation or on the planning and implementation of projects traditionally supported by the EIB.</p>

The only thing we can say is that we have taken a tiny step in the right direction. Only a tiny one, however.

Furthermore, budgetary stability policies will not bear fruit unless they are supported by measures to relaunch the European economy. The bonds in question are targeted at precisely those areas which are likely to create jobs and boost competitiveness, namely, transport and energy infrastructure and broadband. We now have to think about the way forward, that is to say, the establishment of the Connecting Europe Facility. This comprehensive EU ‘infrastructure fund’ will be based not only on subsidies, but also on innovative financial instruments, such as project bonds.</p>

By approving this report, Parliament, having regard to the Commission proposal to Parliament and the Council and the opinion of the Committee of the Regions, has reaffirmed the need for a modern and effective infrastructure for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as reducing unemployment, through the completion of the internal market. The proposal approved today in Parliament not only extends but also upgrades the present Loan Guarantee Facility for the trans-European transport network (TEN-T). While upgrading provides the possibility of covering sectors other than transport, including energy and information and communication technology (ICT) projects, extension enables not only traffic risk to be covered, but all risks possibly leading to a shortfall of revenues in the life cycle of a project. Finally, it is rightly highlighted that it is crucial to find the right balance between the delegated powers granted to the Commission and European Investment Bank (EIB) and the reporting requirements and accountability mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="fr">A modern and effective infrastructure is of key importance for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as reducing unemployment, through the completion of the internal market. To this end, the Commission has proposed a ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ (CEF) for the next financial framework in order to accelerate infrastructure development in the fields of transport, energy and information and communication technology (ICT) networks, with particular emphasis on strategic cross-border aspects. In addition to equity instruments and grants, the CEF includes a new financial instrument to mobilise more private sector funding, as well as project bonds. However, the initial report by the Committee on Budgets and the subsequent negotiations with the Council focused on a limited number of issues including, for example, defining project bonds and evaluating the facility. Nevertheless, I welcome the proposals made in this report, which encourages projects in the fields of transport, energy and trans-European networks.</p>

It did not deem it necessary to fine-tune the criteria for selection of projects to be financed, as these have already been fixed in sufficient detail (EU economic policy objectives, criteria presented in the basic TEN and CIP acts, EU policy guidelines, EIB standard eligibility and environmental criteria, credit risk policies, etc.).</p>
      <p sl="en">However, several references to green sustainability criteria were introduced into the report following Green/EFA amendments to that effect. We, the Greens/EFA, focused on three main points and introduced amendments accordingly: the green sustainability of the projects to be financed; the issue of correct remuneration of the EU actors issuing risk guarantees; and the participation of these actors in the decision-making process concerning the design and implementation of the projects. In the past, such financial instruments at national level have resulted in excessive risk taking by public authorities, resulting in big financial losses financed by public budgets. The first two points were taken over in the text, even be it to a less strict extent. Our amendments on participation in the decision-making process were not taken on board by the rapporteur.</p>

The current recession in Europe is the consequence of the disastrous situation of our public finances. We have therefore embarked on in-depth reforms to put in place sound and rigorous budgetary policies. Nevertheless, for sustainable growth to resume, it is imperative that this budgetary consolidation effort is associated with policies to invest in projects that promote the competitiveness of our companies and our economies. This was the objective of the national loan scheme (known as the ‘Grand Emprunt’) in France, and it is still the objective of the project bonds and the report voted on today. EUR 230 million, redeployed from the current budget, will be earmarked to guarantee private bonds issued to finance investments in projects to further growth and job creation, such as in the fields of transport, energy and information and communication technologies. This report, which has been under negotiation for almost a year, owes nothing to the election of President Hollande and his meaningless and misleading rhetoric on growth.

This is exactly why I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report. It focuses on project bonds which, in addition to equity instruments and grants, help to finance new projects and obtain more private investment. For 2010-2020, EUR 1.5 trillion will be needed to build infrastructure, whereas the figure allocated in the text is EUR 230 million.

      <p sl="et">In today’s vote, I supported the adoption of this report on financial assistance in the area of trans-European transportation and energy networks, more precisely, project bonds. As is generally known, in order to achieve the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as reducing unemployment, it is important to develop modern and efficient infrastructure that could ensure the development of a uniform and efficient common market. The volume of investment required in the area of transport, energy and information and communication technology over the next ten years is roughly EUR 1.5 trillion. In order to achieve the abovementioned volume of investments, significant amounts of private sector funding must be involved, and here I am glad to note that this report encourages that. In addition to increasing the attractiveness of investments, this report will help improve cooperation between private and public sectors. Here, one should certainly note the fact that, in future, it will be possible to combine EU support, Member State funds and funding from the European Investment Bank and the private sector. What is important is the influence that this report will have on cross-border projects, in which the project in question is perhaps not particularly important, but has a significant added value for Europe.

The report addresses the pilot phase of project bonds, which should be launched next year. Project bonds are presented in the report as one of the funding facilities that might be combined with other public and private facilities such as public grants, bank or bond loans, guarantees, equity and others. I consider it important that this facility does not in any way intervene in the setting of traditional grants, which will thus be able to focus on the projects most needed in terms of balancing out the differences in infrastructure between the more and less developed regions. For the pilot phase, the Commission is proposing a contribution from the EU budget of EUR 230 million, obtained by redistributing resources from existing programmes. According to the Commission, however, this redistribution will not have an impact on the finances earmarked for supporting less developed regions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Project bonds are an instrument that has been developed to finance projects in the Connecting Europe Facility, whose aim is to create transport, energy and digital networks. What is worrying is that levels of investment in Europe are falling and this trend began even before the crisis. In addition, networks in the East are not connected to the networks in the West and they need to be joined up. Project bonds are meant to provide an additional instrument for financing infrastructure investment, which will supplement the current system of financing. 2012 and 2013 are earmarked for a pilot project for the bonds and they are to be implemented fully in 2014. The purpose of the pilot stage is to test the reaction of financial markets to the new instrument.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The introduction of project bonds could accelerate the realisation of infrastructure projects by making it easier to obtain private funding. EU backing would provide security for the bonds. Such a containment of risk could encourage various market players to invest in infrastructure projects. Project bonds will not replace grant aid. They are meant as a supplement that will provide more effective and faster investment financing. In addition to the project bonds, private and state funds, whether EU or national, should both continue to play an important role.</p>

With investments in the EU in steady decline over recent years, exacerbated by the economic and financial crisis, restrictions on national budgets and capital requirements for banks, we need to find new ways of stimulating investment that will generate recovery and growth. Project bonds will make investments in vital infrastructure works more attractive, by mitigating the risk associated with them, and are expected to generate exponential results and thus encourage further investment. Hence, project bonds are expected to play a decisive role in the Member States’ recovery efforts, especially in the Member States facing the biggest fiscal challenges. They will also make a decisive contribution to the growth strategy which numerous leaders of EU Member States have called for.

Project bonds are a debt instrument issued by private project companies for a specific project, with the backing of an EU/European Investment Bank (EIB) contribution which will make the bonds safer and more attractive. Like other innovative instruments, the project bonds in this pilot phase can be combined with other public and/or private funding. The EU, for its part, will contribute a maximum of EUR 230 million.

The difficulties in gaining access to long-term private or public sector funding for infrastructure projects should not lead to a drop in the performance of transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructures, nor to delays in broadband network penetration. The Commission should involve the EIB in the implementation of the pilot phase, given that the EIB is the main financier of infrastructure projects and the EU financial body established by the Treaty. The EIB should request budgetary funds based on a project list deemed by the EIB and the Commission as being suitable, in line with the EU’s long-term policy objectives, and feasible. Any such requests and the related budgetary commitments should be made prior to 31 December 2013.

Guarantees from the EU will help to attract private investment in transport, energy and information technology network projects across the EU. The fact that the bonds are guaranteed by the EU budget and the EIB will mean that they are safer and more attractive to capital market investors, for example, pension funds and insurance companies.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this proposal, aimed at redistributing a surplus in the EU budget for the financial year 2012. A good part of the unused funds will be returned to Member States, giving them new and immediate resources that could serve to mitigate the dramatic effects of the crisis we are unfortunately experiencing, and which it seems is still not over. Another part of the amount will go towards covering other payments, already provided for in the EU budget and which have not yet been paid: we hope they will be able to breathe life into companies operating in the fields of research and innovation, who are hit hardest by the problem of late payment in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcome this resolution. I believe that the unspent amount of funds should legitimately go back to the EU budget, as some carry-over of unspent appropriations. Given the surplus from the 2011 budget, the global contribution of Member States to the EU budget will be reduced accordingly. Furthermore, this redeployment is very important and useful because this year, there may be a shortage of funds in the field of research and other areas of EU intervention. This draft amending budget will therefore help secure the appropriate funding of the FP7 Cooperation Programme, taking account of unfulfilled needs, as well as provide further payment appropriations under cohesion policy.</p>

In 2011, for the second financial year in a row, the Budgetary Authority decreased the 2012 level of payment appropriations in the EU’s budget by more than EUR 3 billion, including for research and cohesion policy, as compared to the Commission’s initial estimates. We must stress that the under-spend in expenditure (EUR 0.73 billion) does not result from any absorption difficulties or mismanagement, but from the rules in force for adjusting the repartition of payments in line with the needs. The European Parliament deplores the fact that, despite the provisions of Article 310(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on sound financial management and the Joint Statement on payment appropriations agreed by all three institutions in the framework of the 2012 budgetary procedure, the Council initially decided to reduce by two thirds the level of the EUR 485 million transfer request DEC 9/2012 from under-implemented energy projects to aid economic recovery by reinforcing three budget lines under FP7 – Cooperation.</p>

Their policy is encouraging Israel, preventing the recognition of an independent Palestinian state and escalating and complicating the problems and it harbour dangers for the people. The Greek Communist Party stands in solidarity with and supports the just fight of the Palestinians for the immediate and unconditional creation of an independent, viable and territorially cohesive Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with its capital in East Jerusalem, the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from the occupied Palestinian territories, an immediate halt to and the break-up of the settlements, the immediate and unconditional lifting of the isolation of the Gaza Strip, demolition of the Israeli wall of shame in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank, the immediate reunification of Palestinian families in East Jerusalem and the immediate release from prison of Palestinian nationals and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This resolution concerning EU policy on the West Bank and East Jerusalem reaffirms the EU’s commitment to the peace process between Israel and Palestine. I welcome it, although I do regret that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) put to the vote an amendment based on the responsibilities of Hamas, which therefore creates an imbalance in the resolution and once again gives Israel an excuse to keep things the way they were. In addition, this resolution is a major step forward. For the first time, it condemns Israeli settlement activities, underlines the responsibility of Israel in the deadlock in the peace process, which constitutes an obstacle to the two-state solution, and denounces its regular human rights abuses. In an unprecedented way, it confronts Israel with its responsibilities. I therefore voted for this resolution, which strengthens the European Union’s commitment to uphold international law in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The European Union, as a member of the Quartet for Peace, must have a clear position. Let us hope that this position of Parliament will help us move forward.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The other political groups dropped the resolution of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) concerning the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which was, nevertheless, balanced. My position, as well as that of my political group, is that a solution of two free and independent states living side by side within the 1967 borders should be sought. However, the resolution adopted by the different political groups will not, in my view, encourage the pacification of the region. To my great regret, the agreement is deeply unbalanced and garbles the political message of this House. We cannot expect a solution to this crisis, which is paralysing the region, if the two parties are not placed on an equal footing. From the start, I have fought hard for the ideas of the reasonable provisions to be taken into account. These efforts have borne fruit, particularly with regard to support for the economic and social development of the occupied territories and the need to re-establish a constructive dialogue between the two parties by avoiding any provocation. However, I am convinced that we must put an end to declarations of intent and move towards solutions that will re-establish peace and hope in the region.</p>

Billions of euro flow out of the EU budget every year for support programmes that are supposed to improve the functioning of the Palestinian Authority, so that it can better meet the needs of its citizens. In view of the complicated history of this region, I am in favour of diplomatic pressure on both parties to the conflict in order to speed up the settlement of the core dispute. The resolution submitted by the European left, greens and liberals, however, just pours oil on the fire. The proposers of the text do not even pretend to attempt a balanced approach. I cannot agree to such a one-sided policy. Ideological blindness has never led to sustainable solutions. I am sorry that we were unable, jointly, to find a compromise wording for the resolution that would be fair both to Israel and to the Palestinian Arabs.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to tell you a story about Teresa, who is a lesbian woman who fled from Uganda and came to my constituency of London. When Teresa’s father found out she was a lesbian, he beat her and then he tried to burn her. After that, he told the police about her and the police came and forced her into a cell. The next day, two policemen came and they raped her. The following day, three policemen came and they beat her, and they raped her, and one of them urinated in her mouth. After that, Teresa spent the following year in this stinky little cell being beaten every day, raped every day, and being forced to tell who she knew was a lesbian. During the year, Teresa became pregnant and she gave birth in her cell alone to a stillborn baby. This baby was left to rot next to her for weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Teresa managed to leave and escape and, in 2006, she came to London where she now lives. She is deaf because of the beatings. Teresa is not exceptional. I was unfortunately told by the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group that Teresa is typical of women in North Africa who are lesbians. Teresa, this resolution is for you, and for all the women who suffer for their sexuality.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I wish to stress that the problems of African lesbian women go far beyond the level of everyday discrimination, as Ms Yannakoudakis has also pointed out. Being a lesbian is illegal in 27 African countries, while for men, being gay is banned by law and strictly punished in 38 African countries. We know of several cases in recent months of women being killed because of being lesbian in various African countries. A law banning lesbianism was passed in Malawi this year, while a draft law that would even punish witnesses of lesbian encounters is on the agenda in Nigeria. Even in South Africa, where the constitution bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, so-called corrective rapes are a continuing practice that is not in decline, with several deaths even having been reported in the recent past. One victim was mutilated and burnt alive. Mr President, we are all born equal, and we believe that the European Parliament must not allow the murder of human beings, of women and men, to pass without comment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have listened to Ms Bauer with great interest. However, I am very surprised and extremely disturbed to learn that her group plans to withdraw its support for this report, despite what Ms Bauer had to say yesterday at our shadow rapporteurs’ meeting, indicating that her group would join us in combating violent crime against lesbian women in Africa and supporting equal rights for lesbians and gays, and despite the egregious violations of the human rights of lesbian women and LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) persons.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe this motion for a resolution is extremely important for the European Parliament because the issue at stake here is the defence of human rights in all parts of the world and because this motion calls on the European External Action Service and all representatives of the European Union to uphold these rights and to support the fight against violence perpetrated on lesbian women – widespread violence involving so-called corrective rapes intended to cure women of their lesbianism. People seem to be unaware that this withdrawal is unacceptable. All six groups really need to act as one in this case.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only last weekend, the LGBT community in South Africa again found itself burying three lesbian women, a transgender woman and a gay man, all of whom had met violent deaths. This is happening in a country that was the first in the world to introduce non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in its new constitution in 1995.</p>
      <p sl="de">This course should be taken not only by South Africa, but by Africa as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have fought long and hard to address, at last, the extensive violence against LGBT people in Africa. Sadly, even in the House, too many Members are unwilling to condemn the murder of other human beings only because of their sexual orientation. It is shocking and does not suit the Europe I believe in.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem we are facing is serious and systemic if we consider that, out of the 76 countries worldwide where homosexuality is illegal, 38 are in Africa. In several African countries, we see the so-called ‘corrective’ rape of women who are alleged to be lesbians. When such crimes are committed, the perpetrator should face justice, and where there is institutionalised criminalisation, this should end.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also highlight some good news. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has spoken out, calling for an end to these kinds of injustice. It is important to have more role models like him joining this call. The EU should continue to work with partners and civil society organisations and continue to lead the way in combating violence and discrimination against LGBT people throughout the world.</p>

This is absolutely not the case; the simple fact is that we are opposed to the combining of a human rights provision with a socio-political issue. If you take a closer look at our resolution, you will see that it absolutely and unambiguously opposes every murder and every human rights violation. I would ask you to take this on board.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me just say that, over three years of negotiating urgency resolutions on universal human rights, there have been countless instances where Members of this House have tried to eliminate any reference to LGBT rights and violations of the rights of people, whether through discrimination, violence or murder.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to highlight the fact that this is regrettable and damaging to our credibility in the EU. Human rights are universal; LGBT rights are human rights and that is the end of the story.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, even though the calendar says 2012, we still find that homosexuality is taboo in many places in the world and that homosexual, bisexual and transgender people are persecuted and subjected to violence, violations and humiliation. It is totally unacceptable for the human rights of a particular group to be violated simply because they belong to a minority.</p>
      <p sl="da">When we look at what is happening in Africa, there is still a great deal to fight for. Here, even the most basic rights are non-existent, and our resolution today on violence against lesbian women and the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons in Africa is therefore – sadly – both relevant and necessary. Violence, rape and discrimination against lesbian women occur on a daily basis, both in the form of corrective rape, but also via discriminatory legislation, which prohibits homosexuality and, in the worst case, provides for the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="da">Lesbian women in Africa face a double whammy: they are vulnerable on account of their sexuality and also because they are women. To be a woman in Africa is fraught with danger. Gender-based violence and rape occur frequently and it is rare for the perpetrators to be prosecuted.</p>
      <p sl="da">With this joint motion for a resolution today, we want to call for an end to these abhorrent acts, particularly in the 38 African countries in which homosexuality is prohibited by law. We call on the EU institutions to exert pressure on these countries through negotiations and in cooperation and trade agreements. We call on the African activists, non-governmental organisations and individuals to continue this fight, and for the EU to support the progressive forces that want real improvements in the conditions for LGBTI persons.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the fate of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Africa is of increasing concern. In several sub-Saharan African countries, homosexuality still carries the death penalty. In 27 countries, it is punishable under criminal law. In the case of women, the number rises to 38.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These issues are exploited for political or religious purposes. Homosexuality is denounced as a disease of the West, while homophobia was, in fact, imported from the West by religious people. Several countries are strengthening their repressive laws in this area and, although anti-discrimination legislation exists, it is poorly applied and, in some cases, not applied at all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Women are even more discriminated against than men. They are victims twice over, as women and as lesbians. The accusation of homosexuality is even used to reduce them to silence when they dare assert their right to be different as well as their rights to autonomy and, more generally, equality, not to mention ‘corrective’ rapes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only a few African leaders, like Archbishop Desmond Tutu or Joyce Banda, the new President of Malawi, dare go against the tide. The situation of LGBTs is particularly difficult since they do not have a neighbouring country where they can seek refuge, with discrimination and persecution rife across virtually the entire continent. An analysis of the situation in South Africa, long considered a sort of El Dorado, is worrying.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union simply must not remain silent, but words alone are not enough either. More than ever, it must support the networks that campaign against such discrimination and make these issues a key aspect of the political dialogue with African countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must also throw its doors wide open to those, men and women, who seek asylum because they are victims of discrimination in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this is a very important and serious issue indeed, and I myself was one of the signatories to the resolution. Violence and discrimination against sexual minorities are a problem the world over. In Africa, however, the situation seems to be getting worse every day. Homosexuality is a crime that carries the death penalty in Mauritania, Sudan and in parts of Somalia and Nigeria. A new legislative proposal might also make capital punishment the penalty for homosexuality in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am particularly concerned about a practice that has become familiar in South Africa, where lesbians and transsexual women are being raped in order to ‘correct’ their sexual orientation. One example of this was the case of the female footballer, Eudy Simelane, in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="fi">All countries have an obligation to prevent violence and social labelling on the basis of sexual orientation. Everyone has a right to enjoy the protection of society, regardless of sexual orientation. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activists must also be protected. There is good news, though: I am glad to report that some African countries have now announced that they are opposed to the criminalisation of homosexuality.</p>

They run the homes there, as well as the villages, and this strength must be partly due to the fact that women are heavily discriminated against. We all know that genital mutilation goes on, an appalling practice, but those women who are human rights activists and alternatively sexually oriented are the targets of even greater discrimination. That is why this debate here is so very necessary.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The labelling and abuse that we have been talking about here, and regarding which I heard the term ‘corrective rape’ – and let that be an example – must be condemned.

The European Union should counter it by applying conditionality in its relations with such countries, in particular, with regard to development aid.</p>

      <p sl="en">I call upon these governments who tacitly sanction or turn a blind eye to these acts of violence and discrimination to honour their obligations as signatories to legally binding international human rights instruments and conventions which should be at the forefront of all EU agreements with these countries in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, a hallmark of a modern progressive society is one which does not discriminate or stigmatise on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.

According to estimates by LGBT organisations, these persons are more likely to be victims of harassment, physical attacks, arrests and even murder. Homosexuality is currently illegal in 38 African countries, and in Mauritania, Yemen, parts of Nigeria, Gambia and Somalia, it is punishable by death.</p>
      <p sl="pl">LGBT persons are not only marginalised as citizens by their own governments; they are in no way protected by the governmental executive authorities. Homophobia, which prevails among the police in those countries, in practice means that there is no guarantee of protection or safety. African authorities should condemn all manifestations and acts of incitement to hatred and violence, and punish perpetrators of similar acts.

The fight against discrimination is particularly important, and I would like us to put pressure, with the help of the European External Action Service and other effective methods, on these countries to ease their penal provisions and, in particular, abolish the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that development aid and trade agreements should be contingent on the introduction of legislative changes by those countries. I believe that it is extremely important in relation to this resolution that we are also successful in acting to relax rules which discriminate so heavily against same-sex unions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is sometimes said that the issues of sexual orientation and gender identity conflict with traditional values. The EU position is very clear: no, the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex persons are not a question of different cultures or beliefs, or about introducing new rights for a group of people. They are about the same human rights being applied to every person everywhere without discrimination. The EU has repeatedly called on all states to make this a reality for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="en">Significantly, it has actually been an African country, South Africa, which has taken the lead on the issues of sexual orientation and gender identity at the UN Human Rights Council. This dispels the myth that speaking up about sexual orientation and gender identity is somehow un-African. The EU strongly supports South Africa’s leadership on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Around the world, the EU uses the full range of tools available to it to protest against human rights abuses and to offer practical support to end discrimination against LGBTI persons. In Africa, we have used both public statements and work behind the scenes to argue the case for justice and human rights for LGBTI persons.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have done this, for example, in Uganda and Malawi: in Uganda, by opposing a proposed parliamentary bill further criminalising homosexuality, and by raising serious human rights issues; and in Malawi, by opposing over-long prison sentences imposed on a gay couple. We have also used our political dialogues in Namibia, in Nigeria and in Gambia to raise our concerns about the human rights of LGBTI persons in those countries. Moreover, the EU has been funding projects supporting the human rights of LGBTI persons, for example, in Cameroon and Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p sl="en">To ensure that the EU continues to do the right thing, EU delegations meet regularly with LGBTI human rights defenders and keep a close watch on their situation. The human rights of LGBTI persons have also been selected as a priority for the country strategies on human rights in many countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As recently as 1 June this year, the Commission organised, with Parliament, a high-level conference to discuss how to promote non-discrimination and human rights so as to unlock sources of development and enable inclusive growth. At that event, Commissioner Piebalgs launched a new EUR 20 million package to help fight against discrimination of all kinds, whether based on gender or sexual orientation, religion or belief, race or ethnic origin or disability, which affects millions of people around the world. This new package will be available for NGOs and civil society groups to tackle incidences of any kind of discrimination on the ground.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that Andrzej Poczobut was released from arrest last Saturday. However, I am in no doubt that neither his individual case, nor the broader issue of freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Belarus, is closed. The repression to which journalists in Belarus are subjected is of a political nature. Criminal law provisions are used to harass independent thought. I believe that provisions which enable such practices should be amended, which is what our resolution calls for.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We defend freedom of expression and freedom of the press, because freedom of expression is one of the fundamental human rights, part of the foundations of democracy. In Belarus, these rights are violated. Those who have the courage to describe reality such as it really is, like Andrzej Poczobut, are severely punished. He has already previously been a prisoner of conscience. We must urge the Belarusian authorities to release all prisoners of conscience. I hope that this will happen soon.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we were also positively surprised by the fact that Mr Andrzej Poczobut was released last Saturday but, as the previous speaker has said, there is no way that we can be satisfied with the situation of human rights and of freedom of expression in Belarus, especially for journalists, but also for opposition figures, lawyers and other activists.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been several criticisms about how Mr Lukashenko is handling his country, which is very close to a dictatorship. I think it is the last dictatorship we have in Europe. I am happy that this Parliament stands united against any violation of freedom of expression in a European country.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, in our resolution, we demand from the Belarusian authorities an immediate end to all forms of pressure and oppression, whether against journalists, media workers or other activists, and the release of all political prisoners. This is Europe and Belarus is a part of Europe. Repression as we see it in Belarus has no place in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, even though Mr Poczobut was released from custody, he still faces charges of libel which seem to target him as a result of his journalistic activities and as a member of the Polish minority population, and sadly, he is not the only one. The situation of human rights defenders, civil society representatives, journalists, and citizens in general in Belarus is seriously deteriorating. Freedom of expression, including online on the Internet, is under real pressure. Sadly, this is also taking place with the help of EU-based companies who have exported technologies to Belarus to facilitate this repression.</p>
      <p sl="en">This kind of aiding and abetting of human rights violations through technologies made in Europe should end. It is indeed the last dictatorship in Europe and we should act to turn that around and make it a democracy as soon as we can. The EU should give a clear signal to the Belarusian authorities that they are not welcome at the Eastern Partnership meeting in Brussels at the end of this month. EU engagement with Belarus is already subject to strict conditionality, and the Belarusian authorities should commit to respect for human rights and the rule of law as they stated themselves in the declaration of the Prague Eastern Partnership summit of 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meanwhile, we should step up our engagement with Belarusian civil society organisations and promote more intense people-to-people contact. Simply put, any and all restrictions on freedom of association, assembly, opinion and expression in Belarus need to be lifted. Respecting these freedoms is among the very basic cornerstones of democracy which, ironically, the Belarusian authorities have committed themselves to respect. We may have to consider additional sanctions and indeed step up our efforts to ensure that the EU sanctions in place are enforced so that they are not just a paper reality.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Andrzej Poczobut, who is a Polish-Belarusian journalist, and a major activist for the Polish minority in Belarus, was again imprisoned to await fabricated charges and a political trial.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In Belarus, journalists continue to be imprisoned when they express and write their opinion of the country’s President, Alexander Lukashenko, or society generally. The written word, therefore, can be surprisingly powerful. Just writing one’s opinion can result in a prison sentence of many years for libelling the President.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I believe, however, that the events in Belarus say more about the weakness of President Lukashenko’s ego than anything else. He does not even want democracy and a genuine civil society for the country, because he knows that it would mean an end to his tyranny.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Andrzej Poczobut was later freed. This is excellent news. For this, we should be grateful both to the outspoken disapproval and criticism that the Internet makes possible as well as to the European Union and Parliament and their prompt response. The human rights organisation, Amnesty, had already called Poczobut a prisoner of conscience.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In this connection, it is worth reminding everyone that at least 13 other prisoners of conscience are still awaiting their release in prison cells in Belarus. Imprisoning someone because of their opinion is a gross violation of fundamental, universal human rights, as well as a contravention of Section 34 of Belarus’s own constitution.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The European External Action Service and the Foreign Ministers’ meeting of the Eastern Partnership in July should discuss the deterioration of human rights in Belarus as well as the Poczobut case.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Today, we are adopting a resolution intended to defend the rights of Andrzej Poczobut. I am afraid, however, that most of our voters will be much more interested in the rights of another dissident – Julian Assange, one of the founders of the WikiLeaks server.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Ms Schaake was right when she said that Andrzej Poczobut has not been acquitted, but was released only for the duration of the trial. This means that he may still face five to seven years in prison. We must remember this. Mr Repo was right when he said that there are still 13 opponents in prison, people who have had the courage to oppose the last dictatorship in Europe – we need to remember this. Why was Andrzej Poczobut imprisoned? Because he is Polish, an opposition figure, and a journalist. As if this were not enough, in addition, he is a brave Pole, a brave figure of the opposition, and a conscientious journalist. This was too much for Mr Lukashenko. Andrzej Poczobut’s fundamental error is that he does his duty and he does a good job of it. The only question is: are we doing a good job?</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this Chamber, there is always somebody, sometimes an entire group, who cannot sustain a consistent line of policy for a long time. Sometimes we use carrots, and sometimes a stick. Let us decide, at least for some time, whether to use one or the other, or both in the longer term. It is always the case that the European Union is responsible for what happens in Belarus – albeit in a small way – to the extent that it is unable to maintain a solid line in relation to the regime in Minsk. I urge both Parliament and the Commission to maintain a consistent policy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yet again we are here to denounce the lack of freedom of expression in Belarus, a country with which the European Union has neighbourly links. The correspondent of a major Polish daily newspaper, Andrzej Poczobut, was arrested for alleged libel of President Lukashenko, risking a sentence of up to five years in jail. It is not the first time someone has been sent to prison having been accused of libelling the premier: last year, he spent three months in prison and is under a three-year suspended prison sentence for allegedly criticising the President in his newspaper.</p>
      <p sl="it">The right to freedom of expression and assembly is seriously limited in Belarus, and peaceful protestors were detained and summarily sentenced. There have also been quick and impartial investigations into accusations of torture and other mistreatment, and prisoners of conscience have been denied access to legal aid and medical attention. With this resolution, Parliament must demand respect for human rights in Belarus, something that is essential for any potential, further or subsequent deliberation on enlarging the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, media censorship and restrictions on the freedom of expression are common practice in Belarus. The media law introduced in 2008 allows for the supervision of media and the government uses it enthusiastically. According to unofficial reports, in 2011, at least 95 journalists were detained, and 13 of them were convicted and imprisoned for alleged failure to comply with administrative duties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On 21 June, the authorities arrested Andrzej Poczobut, a Polish correspondent working for Gazeta Wyborcza, and a prominent activist of the Polish minority in Belarus. He was accused of defaming the President and undermining the judicial and executive power of the state. Even though Poczobut was released on 30 June, the charges against him have not been dropped, and he may face a long-term sentence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I strongly appeal to the representatives of Belarus to act in accordance with their international obligations in terms of respect for fundamental human rights, starting from Article 34 of the Belarusian Constitution, which guarantees its citizens freedom of speech and expression.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the case of the journalist and political activist, Andrzej Poczobut, who is from the Polish minority in Belarus, illustrates the brutality and paranoia of the Minsk regime. Poczobut was detained by the KGB and imprisoned for allegedly slandering President Lukashenko in an article written for an Internet newspaper.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the EU, criticism of one’s government is rightly considered legitimate debate and encouraged as an integral constituent part of the democratic processes. However, in Belarus, such free expression earned Poczobut the personal ire of the President, a suspended three-year prison sentence and enduring house arrest while awaiting trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has long been clear that, under the Lukashenko dictatorship, there is no rule-of-law provision, independence of the judiciary or even basic standards of human rights in Belarus. EU sanctions against the regime should be increased until Lukashenko steps down and gives Belarusians a democratic vote to determine their own future governance freely.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in order to maintain its grip on power, the Lukashenko dictatorship relies on brutal repression against anyone involved in opposition activity, critical journalism, the defence of minority rights, the defence of human rights or the genuine independent trade union activity which exists.</p>
      <p sl="en">The arrest and detention of Ales Bialiatski, Chairman of the Viasna Human Rights Centre, is an illustration of this repression. He should be released immediately, together with all prisoners detained for opposition to the regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Parliament should also be calling for an immediate moratorium on executions and the abolition of the death penalty. I call on the international trade union movement to give its solidarity and its active support to the struggle of working people in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">The genuine grass-roots trade unions need to be built to defend the interests of the majority of the population in the struggle against mass privatisations and liberalisations of basic foodstuffs and to fundamentally democratise society and the economy to ensure that the wealth can be used in the interests of the majority of the population rather than a tiny political and economic elite.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, it is often the case around the world that rulers who feel their citizens do not want them at the head of the country seek various ways of holding on to power. The more the people long to get rid of the unwanted leader, the harsher and more drastic the methods such a ruler must use to suppress unfavourable public opinion. Journalists and representatives of the dissatisfied populace then become the first victims of repression, as they are often the voice of those seeking political change.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The approaching parliamentary elections in Belarus naturally provoke increased anxiety in government circles, as the political moods of the population increasingly move away from supporting the present regime. Lukashenko’s minions are well paid for what they do, and political change would deprive them of a stable and highly advantageous position in society. They therefore do not hesitate to abuse the legal system in the name of their leader, in order to harass independent journalists and political opponents.</p>

I would like to say a few sentences about him, because I know him personally. I had the pleasure and privilege of receiving him in my home in Poland, when he represented a delegation of Poles in Belarus. This is a man of unwavering character, who loves freedom and who loves the people who elected him to his position in the Union of Poles of Belarus. This is a man who will not allow any dictator to beak him. He reminds me of Adam Michnik, a legendary figure of the Polish underground, the Polish democratic opposition, who fought for freedom, a journalist and politician. Just as communism in Poland broke its teeth on Adam Michnik and his friends, the Belarusian regime will break its teeth on Andrzej Poczobut. I therefore call on Minsk, Alexander Lukashenko and all his co-workers to be reasonable – if you want to cooperate with Europe, stop persecuting the opposition, including the Poles in Belarus.</p>

Perhaps the signals sent to Belarus – which definitely do reach Belarus, because today, all the information is available on the Internet – do not affect Mr Lukashenko himself, but I believe that there is a group of people surrounding President Lukashenko who fire employees because they belong to the democratic opposition and work for freedom of expression, and who throw students out of schools and universities, and that those people understand that we will remember their actions. We will consistently prevent them from going skiing in Austria, or from going to Spain for beach holidays.

Although he has been released, as we have said here a number of times, the charges have not been dropped. He was sentenced for the first time back in 2011 for allegedly libelling Lukashenko.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, one of the issues that naturally arises in relation to the journalist, Andrzej Poczobut, is the question of the freedom of the press. The freedom of the press, which we in Europe refer to as the fourth estate, is an extremely important element in every democracy. How far one can go and whether the media can be used to publish insults is quite another issue. I believe that the changeover after half a century from a communist dictatorship to a democracy is certainly a very difficult process, something that is underlined by the excessive nature of the punishment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I find it hard, however, to understand the reaction of some European politicians, because Mr Poczobut is a citizen of Belarus and lives and works there. We in Europe should tread with particular care when it comes to getting involved in the politics of another neighbouring country and I believe that the exclusion of a country from European organisations or cooperative bodies, as has been recommended here today, is the wrong approach. When we speak of press freedom, we should always use the same yardstick, as we sometimes tend to close our eyes to the issue of freedom of expression when it comes to important economic partners from the Far East or the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

This debate, therefore, is very timely as we all know that freedom of expression is an essential element for any free election campaign. I think it is extremely timely that we have this very strong message from a very broad part of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Vice-President/High Representative Ashton remains seriously concerned about the continued lack of respect for human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since April, when prominent political prisoners Sannikov and Bondarenka were released, there has been no further release of political prisoners and those who have been released remain subject to heavy restrictions on their civil and political rights. Instead, we have, over the last weeks, again seen an intensification of the repressive policies against independent voices, notably by means of administrative fines and sentences.</p>
      <p sl="en">The spokesperson of Vice-President/High Representative Ashton therefore last week expressed her ‘deep concern about numerous reports over the last weeks of acts of harassment of representatives of civil society, the opposition and independent media’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The freedom of the media remains seriously curtailed in Belarus and independent journalists are frequently directly targeted by the authorities. In the statement of the spokesperson of Vice-President/High Representative Ashton, particular reference was made to journalist Andrzej Poczobut who, for his journalistic activities, as we have already heard here today, has again been charged with libel against the President.</p>

      <p sl="en">To Ms Essayah and others who want an increased effort, I have some encouraging news for you. As of today, there is a new development because the UN Human Rights Council earlier today adopted an EU-sponsored resolution on the human rights situation in Belarus, with 22 votes in favour, 20 abstentions and three votes against.</p>
      <p sl="en">This resolution clearly urges the government of Belarus to immediately and unconditionally release and rehabilitate all political prisoners and, moreover, the resolution establishes the mandate of a special rapporteur on Belarus who will report annually to the Human Rights Council and to the UN General Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that this is a major success for the European Union which this time gained a higher number of positive votes and a lower number of negative votes on the establishment of the special rapporteur than for much milder reporting mechanisms only last year. The situation is serious, but this was some good news.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Human rights violations are, unfortunately, a depressing everyday reality in Belarus. The arrest of Andrzej Poczobut is one of many cases showing how the Belarus Government treats journalists from the free media. I utterly condemn the arrest of Andrzej Poczobut, because denial of liberty solely on the basis of a statement of opinion goes against all democratic principles and is a gross breach of Belarus’s international legal obligations. In view of the fact that Belarus is the only European country to allow the death penalty, I am very concerned about further developments in the country as far as human rights activists are concerned. The political situation is, in my view, very dangerous, particularly for active members of civil society in Belarus, and I would like to emphasise the importance of protection and support for activists from the European institutions. I call on the Belarus Government to release political activists from jail and to end the repression of independent and opposition journalists.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am deeply concerned about the politically motivated arrest of Mr Andrzej Poczobut, the Polish-Belarusian minority activist and journalist. This is not the first time that he has been imprisoned for so-called libel against the President. The deteriorating human rights situation is reflected in the repression of the national Polish minority, whose journalists are silenced, threatened, and intimidated, as well as the broader, long-standing pattern of judicial harassment against journalists, members of civil society, and human rights defenders in Belarus. Belarusian authorities have breached both national law and the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and other instruments that Belarus has ratified. I urge Belarus to end arbitrary detentions and travel bans, to allow freedom of the media and freedom of expression, to allow media, opposition members, and human rights defenders to do their work. I remind the Belarusian authorities that political systems based on oppression and fear are not lasting. Fear leads to hate and hate cannot be the basis of a solid political construction, but it is the seed of destruction. Belarusian authorities, it is in your interest to stop oppression and fear.</p>

      <p sl="en">The case of Andrzej Poczobut is an example of systematic harassment of journalists and pro-democracy activists in Belarus. Many similar cases have been referred to in our resolution. The EU has taken decisive action against Lukashenko’s regime by applying targeted sanctions and he cannot expect any concessions in relations with the European Union unless the regime loosens the grip around free media, minorities and human rights defenders. We call on the Council to consider expanding the blacklist of Belarusians, as there appear to be more people responsible for human rights violations linked to Lukashenko’s regime. To help along the democratisation of Belarus, we should now also reinforce our commitment to assist civil society in their struggle, that there should be more brave people like Andrzej Poczobut. Lukashenko cannot possibly arrest the whole country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Freedom of media and freedom of expression are among the main pillars of democracy. I deeply regret that these freedoms are limited in Belarus by the legislation and in practice. The case of Andrzej Poczobut illustrates how the authoritarian government of Belarus transforms fundamental human rights into an instrument of domestic political pressure and a tool of international influence. I reiterate that international and Belarusian activists and journalists, as well as ordinary Belarusian citizens, become victims of the Belarusian-controlled judiciary system and do not have the right to a fair trial. The European Parliament calls on the Belarusian authorities to respect their international commitments, to respect human rights and democratic principles. The repressions against civil society and political opposition have to be stopped. Free and fair parliamentary elections this autumn could be the ideal opportunity for the Belarusian Government to show its goodwill to move towards EU standards.</p>

The arrest of a journalist is further evidence of the consistently very poor human rights situation in Belarus. I would also like to express my deep concern over the course of events in Belarus. The Belarusian Government clearly abuses its power and fails to comply with international rules such as the United Nations Declaration or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I urge the Belarusian authorities to respect the principles of democracy, including the right to freedom of expression and to reform legislation regarding freedom of the press and freedom of association. Mr Poczobut’s suspended three-year prison term was designed to suspend his work and to intimidate him with the threat of prison. Will he return to prison if any more articles which do not appeal to the Belarusian Government appear in the press? I call on the authorities to comply with standards of international law. Silencing journalists does not maintain a state’s good reputation, but merely constitute acts of harassment and control.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I support this resolution because it condemns the clampdown imposed by the Lukashenko regime on the citizens of Belarus. In recent months, the Belarusian authorities have been implementing increasingly restrictive measures against human and civil rights activists in Belarus and against journalists, opposition leaders and representatives of civil society, including court cases and arrests. Freedom of speech is one of the basic civil liberties, which is also guaranteed by the Belarusian Constitution, and its restriction under any pretext is unacceptable in a constitutional state. Belarus’s democratic path is moving towards cooperation with the EU as part of the Eastern Partnership. Unfortunately, this cooperation is hindered by Lukashenko’s policy of repression and censorship. I hope that the President will choose the path of reform and dialogue with the EU so that we can work together on Belarus’s transition to democracy. In this regard, the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the international observers’ assessment of them will play a decisive role. It is important not only for citizens to be able to freely exercise their right to vote on polling day, but also for the pre-election campaign to offer equal opportunities to all the candidates. Only free and fair parliamentary elections will allow us to invite the democratically elected representatives of Belarus’s citizens to play a full part in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the forced abortion scandal in China is truly shocking. Feng Jianmei was subject to arbitrary arrest and detention by local officials in Zengjia and, after allegedly being assaulted, was subject to a horrific forced abortion in the seventh month of pregnancy. I condemn, as does my group, this barbaric act and welcome the resulting widespread public outcry within China, which was somewhat unusual.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regrettably, sex selective abortions and even female infanticide persist in China, despite campaigns and incentives aimed at preventing and prohibiting these horrendous practices. This has led to an increasing gender imbalance with 118 newborn males for every 100 females, according to the latest census figures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission must ensure that the EU budget does not fund any organisation or entity directly or indirectly involved in coercive family planning policies. The High Representative must, as a priority, place forced abortion and forced sterilisation at the top of the agenda of the next EU-China human rights dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on 2 June 2012 in Zhenping, a seven-month pregnant woman called Feng Jianmei was kidnapped, forcibly taken to hospital, beaten and injected with a product which induced abortion, provoking the death of the foetus. The municipal government of Ankang conducted an investigation that concluded that the officials in Zhenping County used crude means and persuaded her to abort the foetus.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to stress this was known basically thanks to an Internet campaign and this underlines the importance of freedom of expression, including online.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this particular case, I would like to remind Members that, according to the international conference on population and development plan of action, the aim of family planning programmes must be to enable couples and individuals to make free, responsible and informed decisions about child-bearing and to make available to them a full range of safe, effective and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice. Any form of coercion has no part to play.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why we first extend our condolences to the family of the victims, strongly condemn the harassment to which they are being subjected, and demand public protection for them. We also condemn the decision to force Ms Feng to have an abortion and condemn as well the practice of forced abortions and sterilisations globally, especially in the context of the one-child policy. We also consider important the ongoing debate by intellectuals and academics in China on the one-child policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last month, the world was informed through the Internet that Feng Jianmei was abducted and underwent a forced abortion when seven months pregnant. Local authorities did take action, but this was by no means an isolated incident. Infanticide, which is the killing of newborn babies, as well as the massive sex-selective abortions that take place in China, are happening in the context of the one-child policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">These sex-selective abortions have led to a deviation in expected demography by as much 40 million – I just want to repeat this – 40 million missing girls. People should be able to make their own choices about planning whether to have children or not and they should be able to do so in a safe way. Any form of coercion is wrong, first of all, and disproportionately targets women.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that all women have access to reproductive health care as a fundamental right, including family planning and assisted child care. It is time that the UN, and UN Women, started investigating what is happening in China in a systematic manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, let me highlight the fact that this case, which thankfully has sparked so much discussion in China and in Europe, came to our attention as a result of the Internet, which allowed this story to spread. So let us also focus on the importance of Internet freedom and fighting mass censorship, including in China.</p>

To use this right for political purposes, or indeed for party-political purposes, is not worthy of those who claim to defend the universalism of human rights, as recognised by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>

This heinous act, which violates Chinese law, must be condemned, as must all practices that prevent women from deciding freely whether or not to have a child. Internet networks have seized on this tragedy and opened a broad debate in China. An investigation is under way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">China is a country of more than 1 300 million inhabitants. On account of its one-child policy, it is going to experience population ageing on a scale that has not been seen in the world. The Chinese authorities now seem ready to review this policy. We should encourage them, through political dialogue, to move in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="fi">China’s one-child policy, which deeply offends human rights, and the rights of women in particular, prescribes that families in cities can have one child, and families in rural areas two, if the firstborn is a girl. This has also led to selective abortions undertaken on the grounds of gender, with millions of babies being aborted simply because they are girls. This has led, and will lead, to an ever worsening democratic problem in China, because 40 million women will be missing from society, as Ms Schaake said here.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Chinese one-child policy – or two-child policy in the countryside – is a violation of fundamental human rights. It is implemented primarily through abortions and sterilisations. Sex education and birth control are inadequate. In 2011, only 12% of young Chinese had knowledge about contraception. Every year, 13 million abortions are carried out in China, that is to say, 35 000 per day. Only a relaxed family planning policy, accurate sex education and increased availability of contraception can decrease the rate of abortion in China. Forced abortions must be categorically eliminated as a form of cruel and intolerable state violence against women. No state has a right to force either the termination of a pregnancy or its continuation against a woman’s will. Forced abortion, like the prohibition of abortion, is a form of totalitarianism and unacceptable interference by the state with the reproductive rights of women. In both cases, the consequences are similar. Women lose their health, die or are maimed for life. Unwanted children are abused, and even killed. Currently, the population in China is increasing mainly as a result of people living longer, and not because they have many children. Permitting greater fertility may help China change its deteriorating demographic structure.</p>

      <p sl="sk">No government that has the idea of controlling the population should use violence to that end. It is up to parents to decide on the size of their family and the number of children.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the photo of the Chinese woman lying next to her aborted foetus in hospital has sent shock waves around the world. I do not believe that anyone could fail to be moved by the story. The woman was already seven months pregnant with her second baby but was arrested by the regional authorities and forced to have an abortion. As she was unable to pay the fine of CNY 40 000, or EUR 5 021, for violating the one-child policy, she was held captive and, after three days, five men administered the lethal injection to the foetus.</p>
      <p sl="de">Words fail me in relation to this unbelievable and detestable inhumanity. This is not, however, an isolated incident. According to the national planning authorities, 400 million births have been prevented since the introduction of the one-child policy in 1979. In rural areas in particular, regional authorities try to impose their regulations with illegal enforced abortions and fines. Unlike some other Members of this House, I do not believe it enough simply to press forward with human rights dialogue with China. If the EU is really serious about human rights, it must boycott all imported products from China until these inhumane practices are brought under control and the one-child policy is changed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is difficult not to express deep concern over the issue of forced abortions in China. The one-child policy is not only a rule intended to reduce the high population growth in China, but also the cause of forced abortions and deaths of mothers and children. The fact that 23-year old Feng Jianmei was subjected to a forced abortion in the seventh month of pregnancy is inhumane. This case is proof that the methods used to enforce strict family planning rules are reprehensible; even if the authorities in China have already punished those responsible for this cruel act, this is not a guarantee that the situation will not repeat itself.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Forced sterilisation and abortion are a violation of fundamental human rights and demonstrate a lack of respect for new life. This is an expression of a particular form of violence against women and mothers. Restrictive policies trigger ever greater protest in Chinese society. Young women are scared for their lives, because many of them die after the forced interventions. The methods of enforcing existing rules are unacceptable.</p>

Whoever conceives a child outside of the quota set out by the State is issued with a steep fine. Whoever opposes termination of the pregnancy, including family members, is punished with a prison sentence, and their house may also be destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is an atrocity and an unacceptable violation of human rights to subject a woman to a termination just because she does not have a permit from the government. It really would be simplistic to describe this as a simple trauma suffered by one woman, and not surprisingly, according to the World Health Organisation, women in China have a higher suicide rate than men. A pregnancy that is terminated should be defined as true child murder.</p>

The official family planning policy which allows families to have only one child and leads to abortions of female children violates human rights and the integrity of the female body, and deserves the strongest criticism and political intervention. Coercive measures used against women forcing them into abortions, as well as pressure and intimidation, are inhumane instruments of pressure used on mothers to rid themselves of their children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The case of Ms Feng Jianmei shows that forced abortions of foetuses that could be capable of independent existence outside their mother’s body also take place. Between 90% and 95% of seven month old babies born in Europe have a chance of survival, which means they are no longer foetuses, but fully formed human beings. This cannot be tolerated or considered normal procedure within official family planning policy. Our protest should not be limited to words, but should translate into concrete action.</p>

It also seems like a positive development that the local authorities are to pay compensation and intend punishing those involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, this is simply a case of good luck because China’s citizens cannot rely on universal human rights or the protection of the rule of law. Hence, our need to discuss the issue, because the list of those suffering persecution is long and includes writers and journalists, Tibetans who demonstrate against foreign infiltration and repression, Falun Gong practitioners who are tortured in Laogai re-education camps and many other groups.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the one-child policy of China is at the centre of this problem and its implementation through forced abortions and female infanticide is the real measure of its real effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The enforcement of this policy should, frankly, be abandoned by the Chinese authorities. I know that we all wish that and, in fact, the policy itself should be completely abandoned too. In the meantime, recognition in China of the terrible forced termination of a seven-month pregnancy because of a refusal to pay a fine is the very least that can be expected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Chinese authorities should recognise by now that some social policies just do not and cannot work. Entering into the valuable commercial world of trade, as China has done, demands, of course, similar social standards by their governments. It is time for them to wake up to this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, China’s one-child policy is linked with a phenomenon that major 20th century writers from Schlamm to Solzhenitsyn have described as a dictatorship of lies. The Chinese regime claims that this is a campaign by the local authorities. We should not let ourselves be fooled here. This involves a general atmosphere that has been built up systematically over decades and that has its roots in the one-child policy. As long as the one-child policy exists, we will have forced abortions and sterilisations, as well as brutal attacks like those recently perpetrated.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why the real issue here is the one-child policy. We must uphold the freedom of the parents – by which I mean a man and a woman Ms Vergiat – to make decisions and we must uphold the right to life of the unborn child. This is true the whole world over. This is also one of the universal human rights, the right to life, from inception to natural death. Even though we do not have such forced policies, we Europeans also need to put our own house in order and to ensure that human beings are not killed in their mother’s womb. That cannot be considered abuse. The focus today is on China, however: based on human rights, we say ‘no’ to the one-child policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, you said at the start that you would only take contributions from Members who had not yet spoken. My colleague, Ms Kiil-Nielsen, also wanted to speak during the catch-the-eye procedure. She was not given a chance, but we did hear from Mr Posselt, despite the fact that he has already spoken. This was a blue-card question, but nevertheless. For this reason, I would ask you to allow Ms Kiil-Nielsen to speak.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ms Lunacek, the purpose of the catch-the-eye procedure is to make the debate somewhat more lively. In other words, Members who have not been nominated by their groups can be allowed to speak. The blue-card procedure is something quite different. I previously passed over Mr Posselt in the first debate because of the subject matter – he used the blue-card procedure twice – and have decided to give him the floor now. He was not a scheduled speaker, while Ms Kiil-Nielsen was scheduled to speak. We are actually wasting more time than we are saving. The point is, however, that I am trying to bring a little order to the proceedings and that I do not believe I am treating anyone unfairly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU is aware of recent forced abortion scandals in China, including the appalling case of Ms Feng Jianmei, to which many of you have also referred today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has also been alarmed by the reported cases of Ms Pan Chunyan from Fujian province and of Ms Cao Ruyi from Hunan province, who were respectively eight and five months pregnant when they were submitted to compulsory measures to abort their children in April and in mid-June.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has taken note that the Chinese authorities have condemned such practices in the case of Ms Feng Jianmei and have announced that an investigation has been launched and that the responsible officials would be punished.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has also taken note that a large-scale inspection will be conducted in 19 provinces where problems in the implementation of the family planning policy have been reported.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, the EU is concerned by reports that Ms Feng and her family are faced with harassment and retaliation measures due to the publicity they have given to their situation. Thus, the EU will continue to monitor these cases closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">Forced abortions, forced sterilisations and other instances of violence and coercion against women are illegal in China, but implementation of the law remains an entrenched problem on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has thus raised its concern about reports of abuses in the enforcement of the family planning policy in China in the context of the last session of the EU-China Human Rights dialogue, which took place in Brussels on 29 May. The EU urged the Chinese authorities to take measures on the ground to ensure that the implementation of the family planning policy conforms with Chinese laws and China’s international human rights obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU also expressed its concern about the fact that individuals, activists and lawyers who publicly criticise such punitive enforcement tactics face repressive measures. The EU questioned the legal basis for the harassment and intimidation of the blind human rights defender, Mr Chen Guangcheng, before he left for the United States, who had tried to help victims of illegal practices by local authorities in charge of family planning in Shandong province. After his release from a four-year prison sentence, Mr Chen and his family were placed under illegal house arrest and subjected to violent acts by their guards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU also raised the case of the Chinese human rights defender, Mao Hengfeng, whose fight against forced abortions is well known in Europe. We urged the Chinese authorities to take measures to avoid harassment and physical violence by the police against her. The EU will continue to follow this issue and to raise its concerns with the Chinese authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">The horrors of forced abortions in China is just the latest in decades of abuse and torture of Chinese citizens by their communist Party government. We should not forget that since July 20 1999, former Chinese communist party President, Jiang Zemin, ordered the start of the systematic persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, which is still going on. The Amnesty International Annual Report 2012 on China, published on 24th May 2012, states that the Chinese authorities continued to pursue a systematic, nationwide, often violent campaign against Falun Gong; The US State department reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 published on 24th May 2012, where it states that overseas and domestic media and advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting, particularly from Falun Gong practitioners. All of us who care about democratic government should speak out about the last 13 years of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China and democratic governments and societies everywhere should send a strong message to the Chinese Government to immediately stop persecuting Falun Gong practitioners in China.</p>

      <p sl="pl">China is among the EU’s major economic partners and one of the fastest developing countries, economically speaking, in the world. At the same time, there are known cases of human rights violations in this country. I believe that as Members of the European Parliament, an institution based on a foundation of fundamental rights, we have an obligation to emphasise our disapproval of acts that violate physical and spiritual integrity. The case in Shanxi province, which is the subject of today’s resolution, shows the brutal and merciless implementation by the Chinese authorities of their family planning policy. Needless to say, these actions bring to mind scenes from films or books where the action takes place in the Middle Ages. The European Union has taken on the role of promoter and defender of human rights. In the context of the legislative work aimed at strengthening the rights of children and women, I agree with the text of the resolution, and I think that the European Commission should raise this issue at the next bilateral meeting with China.</p>
