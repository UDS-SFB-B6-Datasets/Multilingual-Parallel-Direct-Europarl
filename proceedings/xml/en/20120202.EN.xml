      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report by Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the issues raised by petitioners in relation to the application of the Waste Management Directive, and related directives, in the Member States of the European Union (2011/2038(INI)) (A7-0335/2011).</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, allow me to begin by expressing my thanks to the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, particularly Ms Leffler and others who collaborated with me to make this report possible, including Ms Martín, Mr Kox and Ms Remacle.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, it is almost over a year since the Committee on Petitions decided to draw up a report on waste management in the EU. The decision was taken after it was established that large numbers of repeat petitions were being put forward, condemning the poor waste management carried out by the authorities, the location of certain rubbish dumps, the destruction of some natural areas, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Petitions was sensitive to these claims, and sent several fact-finding missions to the areas concerned in order to verify in situ the truth of the complaints made by the petitioners. All of this has led us here today, to the plenary session of the European Parliament, in order to make it clear that the proper application of current legislation by Member States is an unresolved issue that requires particular attention and on which we should remain vigilant.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I said at the beginning of my speech, most European citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in terms of health, education, transport and security. However, the issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union has adopted a broad raft of legislation, applicable in all Member States, in order to ensure that the legal framework exists to deal with the inevitable result of our modern lifestyle in terms of all the things we discard as waste from our household, from our place of work, from our hospitals, from our industries and so on. It is obvious to all that failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Judging by the petitions received, the concern of many local communities is growing, and this indicates that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem and people expect the European Union to deal with it somehow. An analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the Member States provides very contrasting information and serious breaches of EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission reported in January 2011 that 177 infringement cases concerning landfills had been launched since the deadline for implementing the Landfill Directive in 2001. They had furthermore calculated that there were at the very least 619 illegal landfills still being used in the EU. In its strategic report on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission clearly demonstrates that it is using its best efforts to address the issue of waste management, and it also outlines its medium-term proposals.</p>
      <p sl="es">It should be recalled in this context, Mr President, that the large number of infringement cases mentioned aim at ensuring legal compliance, yet from the petitioners’ perspective, more effort needs to be made to ensure proper follow-up actions in the actual implementation of the law.</p>
      <p sl="es">Closely linked to the waste management process, although upstream of the process, are the EU directives dealing with environmental impact assessments and the access of citizens to information concerning the environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank Mr Iturgaiz for a very good report on the application of the Waste Framework Directive adopted in 2008. I also wish to thank the members of the committee for their views and contributions to this important debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission very much welcomes the report, which presents important facts linked to the state of implementation of waste legislation in Member States. As we have already stressed on many occasions, full implementation of waste legislation is crucial for securing a safe and healthy environment, as well as a resource base for European industry. However, we face a persistent implementation gap in waste legislation and the resulting wide disparity between Member States in terms of performance in waste management not only puts our environment and health at risk, but also prevents the EU economy as a whole, and its recycling and waste management industry in particular, from reaping the benefits of proper implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me quote some facts. First, we have missed opportunities due to poor implementation. Those missed opportunities are estimated to amount to a loss of EUR 72 billion per year. Secondly, if the material going for disposal today was treated in accordance with the existing legislation, we could have avoided between 146 and 244 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. That is the equivalent of taking 47 million cars off the road each year and corresponds to somewhere between 19 and 31 percent of the EU climate reduction targets. Last, but not least, full implementation of waste legislation could create over 400 000 jobs – jobs which we need very badly in the current economic environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are important figures, and for this reason the Commission fully concurs with the conclusion of the report that effort needs to be stepped up to fully implement existing waste legislation. We also subscribe to Parliament’s call on Member States to transpose the Waste Framework Directive without further delay and to ensure full compliance with all its requirements, and, in particular, to establish and implement comprehensive waste management plans so that the goal of European waste laws is put into practice quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to monitor compliance with European waste legislation. We will continue to provide guidance to Member States on practical aspects of implementation, and we intend to streamline resources by identifying and focusing on the most problematic Member States and to address existing deficiencies together with those Member States. We are also looking into the possibility of strengthening cooperation with the European Environment Agency in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that we have efforts under way to address Parliament’s concerns raised in the report and, at the same time, we are grateful that Parliament is bringing much-needed added energy to those efforts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo’s report deals with the problem of shortcomings in waste disposal in some Member States, which is of concern to the people of Europe. I would like to express my considerable thanks to Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, who has made a very good job of putting this report back on an objective footing.</p>
      <p sl="de">In some regions of Europe, there remain serious problems with waste management. In particular, there is a lack of realisable plans for the avoidance, reuse and processing of waste. This gives rise to mountains of waste that overflow into other countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee on Petitions has been able to get a very accurate picture of the situation in the regions through its many visits to the locations concerned. In view of the potential environmental damage and harm to public health that could be caused by waste, we need to get to grips with this problem quickly and consistently. The important thing is for all the regions to implement the existing EU legislation in this area promptly and to draw up comprehensive waste management plans. These regulations do, after all, exist; and therefore they must be complied with by the various countries. The responsibility for this lies primarily with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also am looking to the Commission here. It should intervene at an early stage if it becomes clear that plans are not being properly produced in the regions or regulations are not being correctly implemented, or if the regions are unable or unwilling to draw up and implement such plans. As part of this, sanctions must be imposed quickly and consistently if regions do not comply. Naturally, consumers also have a crucial role to play. Without an awareness among the public of waste avoidance and separation, it will be difficult to establish a positive and functioning recycling system – in other words, a genuinely circular flow of materials.</p>
      <p sl="de">After all, of all the current waste recycling options, the best waste is that which never arises in the first place and can be avoided at the outset. That is good for people, good for the environment and saves resources that can usefully be used elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to sum up what I have said. Firstly, we need the regions to draw up a plan for waste recycling and avoidance. I emphatically agree with the Commission when it says that there can be no money from Brussels unless a clear plan is in place. That is only right. Secondly, and this issue is just as important, we must hold the Member States to account if those responsible in the regions are unable or unwilling to establish such a plan. The Member States must help them to develop such a plan. If there is still a delay – and this is my only criticism of the Commission – then the Commission must help the Member States to produce such a plan quickly, so that our beautiful continent is not spoilt by mountains of waste.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her positive words and for agreeing with us that it is absolutely essential to give consideration to an effective waste policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Over the last few years, we have come across many citizens from various Member States in the Committee on Petitions. Some countries, such as Italy, Bulgaria and Romania, still send a great deal of waste to landfill, although, if I am honest, the petitions did not come from those countries alone. It would seem that waste really is a problem that needs to be taken seriously, a problem that has an impact on a large number of citizens. We can see that there is a lack of transparency. Citizens want to know what is happening, how the authorities are dealing with something that is currently seen as a problem but is actually an opportunity. Waste must become an opportunity, rather than a problem, because an opportunity is what it actually is.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You told us that everything is under control and that more attention is going to be paid to this area. Quite honestly, though, we have already asked the Commission on various occasions in Plenary – this is therefore not the first time that we have asked – not just to tell us what needs to happen, but to actually do something.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have rules, and they are good in the European Union. We make it very clear that there needs to be a plan, that there is a hierarchy and how waste must be handled. Obviously, it is also important for all the planning to be implemented, however – in other words, for there to actually be some action. That is why we are calling for real action, and my colleagues endorse this, for the introduction of a zero tolerance policy, and for subsidy streams to be turned off so that pressure is also brought to bear to take action. Ultimately, we are calling for a Member State to be called to account before the Court of Justice as soon as possible for why nothing has happened, for fines to be imposed whenever applicable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am thus asking very clearly for three things. These are also in the report, but I will just recap here in any case.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, I am calling for a zero tolerance policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second request is for set-up assistance wherever a Member State cannot manage alone. In times of crisis, it is clearly difficult to constantly have to find the people, the resources and the ideas to ultimately handle waste well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The third thing we need – and this is the most important of all – is real transparency, as that is what the citizens are demanding. Without it, the citizens feel excluded. We need transparency about how waste is handled; in other words, is it toxic, what happens to it, where does it go and is it dealt with lawfully? What do we need to do to ensure that this problem becomes an opportunity, since we need these materials? For goodness’ sake, let us take precisely those regions of Europe that are still having difficulties at this point in time and make them the most modern regions and deal with waste in an entirely new and creative way since, in future, we really will need every bit of plastic.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to offer you my best wishes on your new position.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy that today, we are debating in plenary a resolution that stems from the many petitions that reach the European Parliament, and that refers specifically to the question of waste. These petitions demonstrate the concern of European citizens about the harm done to the environment, human health and the economy by waste management practices prevalent in various areas in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even though I agree with the overall structure of the resolution, I am rather dissatisfied with how some of its passages address the issue of incinerators. At times, it seems that thanks to technology, any problem related to public health and the environment has been completely overcome. Until last year, right here, we were hearing the same words about nuclear power plants. Today, however, in this same Chamber, it is difficult to find anyone willing to defend the nuclear industry. Is it possible that politics is simply unable to take a long-term view? Do we really have to wait for more epidemiological studies confirming the increased cancer rates already found throughout populations living near incinerators?</p>
      <p sl="it">This is not the NIMBY syndrome, but simply the citizens defending their right to health. There are alternatives that are virtuous and create employment. We must implement the spirit of the Waste Management Directive strictly, with a waste cycle based on the concepts of reduction, reuse and recycling. Landfill and incineration are residual, hierarchically inferior options, resorted to only after everything else possible has been done. If there was a political will to that effect, incinerators would be a nice memory.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that Parliament should take a more advanced stance and better protect its citizens in this area. I hope that the European Commission will propose stricter criteria and procedures for building incinerators and opening landfill sites, and encourage serious ‘zero waste’ policies in all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that this report is suffering from a very serious shortcoming that it has had since its inception. Far too many members of our committee are uneasy, not to say unwilling, when it comes to criticising members of their own party in their own Member States and have therefore succeeded in ensuring that it is not as specific as it should have been in view of the many complaints. It has become far too general a report, which would probably not have been out of place in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. This is something that we ought to change quickly. Our committee cannot operate if we do not all rise above party politics.</p>
      <p sl="da">Having got that out of the way, I would like to express my wholehearted praise for Mr Iturgaiz Angulo for his almost perfect cooperation on this report. We listened to one another. I believe that, despite the one-sided conditions, this report is a very good one, and I would like to express my thanks for that.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, I have the same two points of criticism to make that have already been mentioned. Firstly, we have the deficient implementation – the fact that the problems are not taken seriously, there is a lack of adequate cooperation with the Commission and with other regions, town and cities that have solutions in place and citizens are not sufficiently involved. We cannot solve these problems unless we work much more closely with our citizens. In far too many places – in Italy in particular – we have seen that citizens are almost regarded as the enemy when it comes to solving these problems. This has been a horrible experience. We saw something similar but to a slightly less worrying extent in both Bulgaria and Spain, but Italy really is a dismal example in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="da">My second point of criticism concerns the question of resources. We are currently facing not just one, but two crises. We are currently in the midst of a resource crisis, and clearly the most stupid thing we can do in relation to our scarce resources is to discharge them into the water or place them in a remote landfill site. The second most stupid thing we can do, however, is to burn them. We now have to put a stop to the pyromania. Not even the best incineration plants should be permitted to incinerate our scant resources. We must work at meeting all the requirements of the Waste Management Directive, but also invest intelligently in plants that are able to recover resources so as to develop our waste strategy in a modern way. That is what we need, first and foremost.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to give a very strong welcome to this report on behalf of my group. I am involved in Parliament with waste management via my membership of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I have to say how interesting and refreshing it was to read this report from a slightly different perspective, because it does take out a lot of what I might call the vested interests (and I mean that in the nicest possible way) – people who have their views and have had them for a long time and have worked very hard to get what they want through. Sometimes, it is difficult to lift your head up and look at the big picture, so a report such as this, I think, is really very useful.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course it is about a subject which very clearly and very closely concerns all of the people that we represent. There are very few subjects for me as a constituency MEP that I get quite so much passion from my voters about as waste management. I feel that it is an area in which we, the European Parliament, stand to be judged. If we do not get it right and if we do not make sure that we enforce, then all of the talking that we do here comes to nothing. All of that is encompassed in this very interesting and useful report.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are huge differences in the way that Member States deal with the problem of rubbish, and I actually welcome the fact that we have those differences. I welcome the fact that this report recognises very strongly the issue of subsidiarity. It is about a Waste Framework Directive. Many of you will remember my predecessor, the lady that I replaced in this Parliament – Caroline Jackson – who was the rapporteur on the Waste Framework Directive. One of the principles that she was very keen on espousing was that Member States should be allowed as much subsidiarity as possible within the framework of tight and challenging targets. I know from recent conversations with her that she is extremely disappointed that, having been given that freedom, Member States are not delivering, because we are not making those targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where we need to really tighten up – and this is in the report – is not on a whole raft of new regulations but on making those that we currently have work better and more effectively. A framework is just that. We need to get our Member States working towards that framework. I was really shocked here to see how many infringements there are in my own Member State – I thought we were doing OK. So in that sense, this is a great report for bringing that home.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just on one point: I am happy to defend nuclear energy. But it has to be done with good technology, tightly controlled. The same is the case for incineration.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, both the report by Mr Angulo and the number and content of the petitions received by the Commission from citizens and operators prove two things: firstly, that the problem of waste is an urgent and burning issue and, secondly, that, despite the differences that obviously exist, the Member States are not performing satisfactorily in terms of waste management, thereby creating public health and environmental problems. One point on which I would like to comment, which the report also underlines, is that, although landfill is the last resort under EU legislation, there are countries, mine included, which are lagging behind in recycling and prevention and are therefore under pressure to extend existing landfills or create new ones, in breach of Community legislation and common sense, thereby causing serious problems in local communities and resulting in conflicts and solutions that are dangerous to the environment and public health. The second comment on the report that I wish to address to the Commissioner has to do with various cases in which the Commission washes its hands and is indifferent to the fact that it needs to intervene, such as where there are obvious errors in the waste management plans and environmental impact studies being processed. In such cases, Commissioner, the Commission needs to intervene. I think that the report, generally speaking, concerns a useful directive that will assist us in waste management.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, firstly, I should like to congratulate Mr Iturgaiz Angulo on his exceptional report, which we discussed in committee and on which we congratulated him at first reading. European citizens expect government authorities to provide adequate and effective services, especially in the waste sector, because they have a massive impact and harmful repercussions on public health and the environment. According to the UN, mankind’s problems up to 2030 will be as follows, in the following order: combating social exclusion, immigration and environmental issues. I do not know if they are in the right order, but this is an issue which deserves serious attention. The petitions received on the subject by the Committee on Petitions are now a regular occurrence. I therefore recommend, as the report emphasises, that the 2008 directive should apply to waste, as it lays down rules to protect the environment and human health, with the aim of preventing or reducing adverse repercussions from the production and management of waste. We need to pay attention to resources, to sites and to the public and, when I say the public, I mean that we need to educate the public. We need transparency in waste management procedures because waste management is a huge economic event. We need to pay particular attention to all this throughout Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019-000" speaker_id="28255" name="Andreas Mölzer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the EU generates 2 billion tonnes of waste, of which 40 million tonnes is classed as special waste, every year. On a per capita basis, it puts the role of India and China as waste producers into perspective. Although North America, Western Europe, Japan and Korea are known to lead the field when it comes to recycling, they still generate more waste than the rest of the world put together. The developments that go hand-in-hand with rising disposal costs should not be underestimated. In the US, electronics manufacturers save on disposal costs by shipping electronic waste to Africa or other areas of the developing world and calling it development aid, not to mention the innumerable tonnes of German PET bottles that are processed into stuffing for soft toys in China, where expensive environmental legislation and rules on worker protection do not apply, or which eventually end up in items of clothing destined for the West.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, many materials can only undergo the recycling process a limited number of times. In other cases, only a small proportion can be recycled. Downcycling is just as much of a problem as transporting waste all the way across Europe and the black sheep that dump waste illegally. What might be helpful, therefore, is the combination of an increase in recycling rates together with strict controls on exports of electronic waste and a shifting of the cost burden onto those who cause the waste. Waste avoidance measures are even more important, however. In ordering everyone to use toxic energy-saving bulbs, the EU has hardly covered itself in glory in this respect. Moreover, we must not forget that the issue of the storage of nuclear waste has still not been resolved. That is yet another reason to refrain from building more nuclear power stations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, for the work he has done.</p>
      <p sl="it">This own-initiative report from the Committee on Petitions stems from the strong need, felt by most, to respond more fully to the citizens who have submitted to the Committee on Petitions countless petitions, which are, in point of fact, complaints, regarding serious misapplication of EU law in the environmental sector, but particularly in the field of waste management.</p>
      <p sl="it">One hundred and fourteen petitions, over a period of time that we can describe as short, from 16 different countries with the highest numbers from countries such as Spain, Ireland, Italy and Greece. The most common complaint relates to the improper activation of incineration and waste-treatment plants. This indicates that citizens are badly informed with regard to the effectiveness of the advanced technologies used for these types of plants.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that this sector is extremely important, especially at such a sensitive time as this, with a global financial crisis that is also devastating the European Union. As the Commission has often repeated, following numerous detailed studies on the issue, a different use of waste resources would save the EU more than EUR 72 billion and would create more than 40 million jobs. I think these figures are important, in particular, when combined with the benefits for the environment and health, which are really the primary concern for us all.</p>

I consider that the suggestions made in this report, at certain points at least, may allow the Commission and the Member States to adapt their policies, in order to address a problem which, although not equally serious in all the EU Member States, is taking on ever increasing dimensions. I consider that the Member States have a basic obligation to inform their citizens, without confining themselves merely to comments, and to restore confidence in connection with a problem that concerns us all. I think that it goes without saying that we need more objective data to measure environmental infringements. Finally, I consider cross-border cooperation to be very important.</p>

In the period 2004-2010, the Committee on Petitions actually received and declared admissible a total of 114 petitions, alleging breaches of European Union legislation on waste alone. This indicates all too clearly that the issue is a topical one, and one that is also rightly worrying the public.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There are enormous differences among the Member States of the European Union as regards their waste management policies, and this is something that we ought to be able to address more closely. The deadline for the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive expired in 2010, and only six Member States have managed to implement it. In other words, public concern regarding the matter needs to be taken very seriously.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, congratulations on your report. Unfortunately, your party has not always taken this line, even when in power. One example is my region, Galicia, where waste management does not prioritise prevention, reuse and recycling, as set out in item 12 of your report. At present, Galicia incinerates 42% of its waste, and the Galician Government is planning a new incinerator in O Irixo, which will consolidate the predominance of investment in this system for its waste treatment. Furthermore, although the plan is to incinerate half of the waste produced by 3 million people, it does not comply with the environmental impact assessment referred to in items 18 to 25, but has opted for a shortened procedure.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The project also fails to comply with items 16 to 18 on the necessary dialogue and information for the people affected, who are against the incinerator. I would therefore urge compliance with European legislation on waste management, and would ask you to please send your report to the Galician Government.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, although the report describes the environmental crimes that pass for waste management and environmentally catastrophic practices, it adopts all the factors that cause them. Instead of proposing measures to combat the pollution caused with impunity by big business, the report openly advertises the catastrophic action by monopolies in the sector. It welcomes Directive 2000/98/EC, which promotes the incineration of waste for energy, which is destroying the environment and putting public health in danger, in order to increase capitalist profits. That same directive legalises pollution with impunity by industrial capital, because it allows hazardous waste to be mixed with non-hazardous waste. The report refers to the role of organised crime in creating environmental dangers, in order to conceal the real class-based crime against the environment being committed by the monopolies, the bodies of the European Union and the governments of the Member States. In Greece, in Argolida, Crete and numerous other areas, the health of the workers is at permanent risk from the landfills containing toxic sludge that are operating next door to their homes. The solution, as far as we in the Greek Communist Party are concerned, is to reverse the anti-environmental policy of the European Union, in order to safeguard the health of the workers and protect the environment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent and balanced report which also rightly refers to the principle of subsidiarity, and therefore recognises the important and pre-eminent role played by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report, however, also paints a picture of a multi-speed Europe. As far as my country is concerned, there are two speeds. On the one hand, there are certain cities and regions – for example, Naples and Campania – that are a source of shame for those of us who, for the moment, have identity cards issued by the Italian State, a great source of shame that we continue to denounce. On the other hand, there are the virtuous towns of Padania where we have hundreds of mayors, for example, those of the Northern League, who may be ‘barbarian dreamers’, but who are also civilised people who teach citizens and ensure that they sort their rubbish and who organise the collection and incineration of waste. This civilised part of our country is an example for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">So let us move forward in this direction. I welcome the petitions which also inform the European authorities of these situations which, as I have said before, in Campania also pose a threat to European tourists who risk setting foot in those areas.</p>

I would like to know if this is an imaginary place like Duckburg or some other hypothetical town from a fairy tale. I ask because he referred to Naples and Campania, a region that I would remind you is controlled by a local centre-right government in Italy.

This is an official document of the European Parliament. Also, when she leaves her mafia homeland to come up north, she can see road signs saying ‘Higher Padania’ or ‘Lower Padania’.

      <p sl="fr">We have finally arrived at the vote on this report, which is extremely important because it allows us to raise our fellow citizens’ difficulties and fears in this Chamber before the Commission and the Council. Here is further proof of the effectiveness of the right of petition in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The majority of petitions are related to the environment and waste represents a major concern for our fellow citizens. This issue must reflect a problem in society. We are consuming left, right and centre. We are only now realising that what we do not consume we throw away. This awareness must absolutely be reinforced among the citizens; this much is clear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet this report is also a timely reminder for the Member States. It is nevertheless worrying to see that the States do not seem to be in control of the situation. Only six Member States transposed the framework directive on waste on time. The number of complaints received regarding the issue sometimes shows the lack of transparency in the choice of location for landfill sites.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, and this is the most worrying aspect, members of organised crime seem to do as they please. A EUR 75 billion market is very attractive to the greedy. The Member States must send out a strong signal. There must be greater penalties for companies that use public contracts to enhance their own wealth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is a warning to the Member States, but the European Commission must also play its part and ensure that the directives on waste are properly implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This dossier needs to be made visible but also credible. If no one plays the game, we will continue to waste time and money on verification and counter-verification procedures which could go on for years. Let us listen to the message from the petitioners and put a stop to this mess as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="it">An interesting aspect of the report is the attention paid to the disposal of illegal waste that affects many regions. In my region, as a delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to ascertain, high levels of caesium-137 have been detected. This is typical nuclear waste even though there are no nuclear power plants in Italy.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear that this is a Europe-wide problem. There is illegal trafficking of waste that must be monitored and curbed, but which has so far been ignored by the European Commission. It is therefore easy to state that only a few countries, including Italy, do not apply European standards. Instead, given that illegal trafficking of waste extends beyond national borders, we need to think about how to deal with this at a European level.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, this resolution lists 115 cases involving claims from citizens of 14 Member States that the Waste Management Directive has been infringed. However, we all know that there are far more cases of this type, even if they have not all been brought to the attention of the Committee on Petitions. I personally know of at least one case in Romania which is being investigated at regional level. This situation is a serious indication of the failure by many national governments to enforce this vital legislation for protecting the environment and our citizens’ health. However, the situation regarding waste from mining activities is also just as worrying. I have reiterated my concern on this matter, both within Parliament and directly to the European Commission. The Commission assures us that the Mining Waste Directive contains sufficient provisions to protect the environment, including in connection with mining using cyanide technologies. However, I call on the Commission to answer the following question: what will happen if the Mining Waste Directive is enforced to the same degree as the Waste Management Directive? It does not require too much imagination to realise that the consequences of such a situation would be really disastrous.</p>

We need to acknowledge that public awareness needs to be increased in relation to how to manage waste, both within the home and at work. There is much to be done. If people were obliged to visit landfills that were not working properly, they might think twice about dumping waste and putting it into refuse sacks. I know that in County Louth, where I come from, there is an old landfill dump that now soaks up a great deal of money because of the environmental problems it poses, and it also causes difficulties for the people who live in the area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask the Commission to address the issue of recycling tyres – perhaps not today, Commissioner – as this certainly is an area where there is a lot of illegal activity. We are not getting the value from the recycling of tyres that we could.</p>

In most Member States, major investment is required to introduce waste management strategies and suitable infrastructures and facilities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission to support Member States in the process of implementing European legislation by providing suitable funding mechanisms and clear, precise guidelines and criteria regarding the location of landfills in relation to residential areas, schools, local health care centres and drinking waters sources, in order to provide stronger guarantees against possible risks to human health and the environment. Public dialogue is vital right from the planning stage. I should emphasise the importance of impact studies and having public debate about them. I urge Member States to give greater support to local and regional authorities so that the best waste management models are implemented.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, I support the ideas and thoughts expressed in the regulation and in the report. Personally, I believe that greater attention should be paid to processing organic waste, particularly in those regions where agriculture plays an active part. Organic waste is comparatively easy to use if it is incinerated, but in this way, we lose a lot of value. Products with new added value could very well be produced from this form of waste and, here, finance could also come from the second pillar planned for agriculture. Stricter standards need to be brought in for both waste management and the use of chemicals in agriculture and industry.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, waste management is seen by the public as a very sensitive issue. The European Commission should therefore monitor compliance with the waste management directives in the individual countries. The conclusions of the Commission report from the beginning of the previous year showed that several EU countries are not paying proper attention to the protection of the environment and waste management. Dozens of proceedings for breaches of legal regulations and information on hundreds of illegal and thousands of non-compliant landfills are alarming findings and draw our attention to the fact that the Commission is also failing in this area in the enforcement of EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Waste treatment, if it is well organised, can be a profitable sector of the economy, and waste recycling is a great help to us in environmental conservation. Therefore, as has been shown, we will need to make much greater efforts to implement better functioning mechanisms for the management and effective treatment of waste.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, illegal or non-compliant landfills and incinerators are indeed a disturbing problem. They are a threat to both health and environmental safety. They also mean the absence of the savings which can be realised by smart and effective waste management, and the absence of the potential to recover valuable raw materials which are in short supply. They also mean lost jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Much remains to be done in the field of raising the citizens’ awareness about responsible waste management and its resultant benefits. It is important to have greater coordination of waste management at regional and local level, as well as for residents to have easy access to transparent information, not just about how waste should be sorted, but also about what happens to it later.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In many countries, modernising the waste management system is going to require significant investment. Funding this work should also be one of the Union’s priorities. Furthermore, it would be particularly useful to intensify action to identify best practices and facilitate their exchange at national level and throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to give my most sincere gratitude to the honourable Members for this substantive debate, which reflected the attitudes of our citizens. Let me make the following points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, for the Commission, the number one priority is to put in place the right sequencing of action, namely, first reuse, recycle, recover and, only if that is not possible, go for landfills based on stringent environmental impact assessments. During this process, we naturally look very seriously at the transportation of waste.</p>
      <p sl="en">So how do we help the Member States? Through guidance and best practice, but also by scrutinising national management plans to make sure that they are adequate in helping with the problems. For the ten countries with more serious problems, we intend to carry out individual meetings to accelerate action. Obviously, when action falls short, we do not hesitate to start infringement procedures – out of 19 which have been started, nine are still ongoing – and also, as a last resort, to take Member States to the European Court of Justice for breaches of EU waste legislation. May I just stress that one third of the environmental cases concern failure to deal properly with waste management.</p>
      <p sl="en">I completely agree that not only should we do the right thing at home, but we should also set the right example for developing countries, because a mountain of waste somewhere else would actually have implications for the status of our planet. I could not agree more with the point that has been made by Members that in these tough economic times, waste reuse, recycling and recovery is an economic opportunity and we should not miss out on a good crisis to grab it.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a specific question on mining waste. After the Baia Mare accident and an international Commission report, we have come up – to the best of my knowledge – with the most stringent directive in the world. We are working very closely with countries, including Romania, to make sure that the directive is respected and implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a point on public awareness. We certainly need to work on that. May I just add that I spent most of my professional career working on the environment. I started because a member of my family got sick – irrevocable damage was caused to his health – because of groundwater pollution. Therefore, I fully share the emotional attitude of our citizens and our Members of Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her interesting opinions and also my fellow Members who have participated in this debate. To some of the latter, I would like to say that comments have been made about the appropriateness or otherwise of holding this debate in the Committee on Petitions, and of referring the matter on from that Committee to this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">With your permission, Mr President, I would like to commend and defend the Committee on Petitions as an appropriate setting in which to debate these issues. I say this given that those who submitted petitions, the citizens of the European Union, have addressed the Committee on Petitions. Apart from the fact that citizens can address other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and bearing in mind that opinions may be developed and reports drawn up in other committees, I think that when citizens approach the Committee on Petitions, they want us to respond and provide a solution to their problems. Clearly, we cannot look the other way or divert attention. Were we to do so, there would be no point to the work and actions of the Committee on Petitions within the European Parliament or, indeed, to the very existence of that Committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, I would like to say to certain colleagues that the petitions have referred systematically to the constant deficiencies that occur with waste management and to the real, habitual inability of the Member States to fulfil their legal obligations. This really is the way things are at present. These thoughts and problems have also been included in the report, however, hence the request for the Member States to transpose the Waste Management Directive without further delay, and to guarantee that all its provisions are fully complied with, especially through the establishment and application of comprehensive waste management plans.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Mr President, I believe that through this report and Ms Georgieva’s own words, a very direct course has been set to try to resolve all the problems that have been outlined by the groups, many problems that are related to this issue, but I also believe that it needs to be emphasised that delaying is not an option, nor can a blind eye be turned, when it comes to resolving the many, many issues and petitions that are being received from countries throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We are all aware that in most Member States, major investment is required to introduce waste management strategies and suitable infrastructures and facilities.

      <p sl="ro">An analysis of the waste management policies implemented by EU Member States provides very contrasting information. Some Member States, including Romania, are lagging behind in their implementation of waste management strategies and, in this context, the legacy of the past and the excessive dependence on landfills, along with the attitude towards waste disposal, which should be changed, have caused numerous serious breaches of EU legislation to occur. Article 4 of the new Waste Framework Directive specifies a mandatory waste hierarchy: prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling or other forms of reuse, including energy recovery and disposal by means of safe incineration, with landfills as the very last resort.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on Member States which are faced with obvious waste crises to consider the fact that more efficient waste management strategies provide opportunities for job creation and revenue growth, while ensuring environmental sustainability through reuse, recycling and the recovery of energy from waste.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We have just heard from the Commissioner how many benefits recycling, and recycling of electrical waste in particular, bring to the economy. The correct policy for dealing with waste is therefore essential, since electrical waste is one of the fastest growing areas of waste in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Slovak Republic has long since achieved the objective set out in Directive 2002/96/EC and, since 2010, we have been encountering the problem of an excess over the minimum limit of recycling four kilograms of electrical waste per capita per year, and this is going to rise. During the transition period that Slovakia is in, we will therefore cover the deficiencies that remain among producers and importers or from anonymous electronic sales and, likewise, we will restrict the selection of those who still do not contribute to the funding of waste collection and subsequent treatment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Union has recognised the urgent need for responsible waste management and has created a whole system of secondary legislation, placing on the Member States a series of responsibilities related to the storage, segregation and recycling of waste. The Union is moving towards a situation in which waste will stop being a danger to the environment but will instead become an effectively used resource. I think the effort being made in this direction is clearly worthy of praise and support. However, it should be admitted that even the most sincere desire and the most determined action of the EU cannot produce results if the Member States do not express a desire for effective cooperation in this area. Despite the deadline of December 2010 set for transposition of the directive into national law, only six Member States have managed to do this. We in the European Parliament should pay particular attention to the opinion of the Union’s citizens. An expression of this is the number of petitions submitted to the Committee on Petitions – 114 – which call attention to various aspects of waste management which do not comply with EU law. This shows that it is in the interest of the people who live in the EU for the Member States to bring about implementation of the contents of the directive into national legal systems as quickly as possible. Taking into account the interest of the European Union as a whole and of individual citizens, I call upon the Member States to adapt their national legal systems to the contents of the directive.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Rapid and dynamic economic growth is inevitably associated with a threat to the natural environment. Therefore, the European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament, must also set standards for environment protection which will be appropriate in a changing economic reality. A definite step forward on this matter was the implementation by the Member States of the Waste Management Directive, the objective of which was to improve and raise the standard of the management, processing and storage of waste. This was imperative in view of the huge amount – over 2 million tonnes – of rubbish processed in the Union every year. However, as is evident from the numerous petitions which are received by the Committee on Petitions and from the fact-finding visits which have been made and which are discussed exhaustively by Mr Iturgaiz Angulo in his report, we can conclude beyond doubt that the objective of the directive has only been achieved in part. For this reason, it is essential that further effort be made by the entire Union to eliminate cases of non-compliance with, or incorrect performance of, the provisions of the directive. In addition, we cannot forget that the ultimate effect of this work in large measure needs the cooperation and commitment of society and requires that those who violate our common good bear responsibility for their actions.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Regina Bastos, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the Daphne programme: achievements and future prospects (2011/2273(INI)) (A7-0006/2012).</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the Daphne programme is the only EU programme intended to contribute to protecting children, young people and women from all forms of violence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This programme has been a genuine success since its launch in 1997, both in terms of its stakeholders and in terms of the effectiveness of the projects funded by the programme. The report that we are now discussing, on the progress made and the future prospects for the Daphne programme, was adopted almost unanimously in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with only one abstention.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Work with the other political groups has been very fruitful, so I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for the very positive contributions that they made to this report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Combating violence against children, young people and women remains a priority and is, unfortunately, still necessary. This is clear from the new forms of violence that have emerged recently with the growing use of social media, violence at day nurseries, ill-treatment of the elderly and sexual assault among teenagers. Moreover, in the current situation of economic crisis and budgetary austerity, there is a need to avoid the direct financial impact which this type of crime has on the judiciary and on health and social services.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The costs of domestic violence in the EU have been estimated at EUR 16 billion per year, including all direct medical costs, court and police costs, social costs and economic costs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Last November, the Commission announced that from 2014, the Daphne programme will be incorporated into the rights and citizenship programme. We must admit that we would have preferred this programme to remain independent and autonomous. As this is not an option, I would point out three concerns: firstly, safeguarding the aims of the programme for the 2014-2020 period; secondly, keeping its funding at the same level as that of previous programmes; and, thirdly, ensuring its visibility within the future rights and citizenship programme.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If this programme is to remain effective, it is vital to ensure that its beneficiaries, public authorities and non-governmental organisations continue to be kept properly informed about how it is funded and conditions for accessing it. Small organisations, which, by their nature, have more direct contact with phenomena of violence, often have administrative problems, and should be able to participate fully, as they play a vital role in detecting these problems and coming up with innovative ways of tackling them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The balanced sharing out of projects between all the Member States should be taken into account. Moreover, the collection of comparable data on different types of violence in the EU is very useful in ascertaining the real level of the problem and finding appropriate solutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall conclude by stressing the importance of using the media to raise awareness of violence in the fields of education and health, and among the police and the judiciary.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Bastos for drafting this report. The Daphne programme must receive sufficient funding. This will provide the necessary means for combating violence in its wide variety of forms, both in the private and public setting.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should emphasise the importance of paragraph G. The economic crisis is making women more vulnerable to abuse. In my country, the Open Doors programme is currently being run, cofinanced by the European Commission through the Daphne III programme. It is part of a partnership with Austria, the UK, the Czech Republic, Greece and Slovenia. It is aimed at immigrant women who have been victims of violence. This initiative offers them the chance to become integrated into Romanian society, while also being community leaders in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, now it is my turn to congratulate Ms Bastos on her report, which, I believe, is very comprehensive and tackles all the questions raised in the Commission’s interim evaluation report. Clearly, this report focuses on the involvement of NGOs and small entities, on improved management, and on anything which effectively allows the objectives of the programme to be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, I do have some regrets. Firstly, I regret that a debate has not really been organised today on this report, as that would have allowed us to bring the focus back to the violence which still affects young people, women and children everywhere. I particularly regret this because, if I have understood correctly, there is a certain desire to remove several references to prostitution and the violation of women’s rights in terms of sexual and reproductive health. Clearly, there are therefore things which have still to be resolved, which are not totally clear from various people’s remarks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have run out of time to talk about prevention and education about stereotypes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to finish with two issues we must be vigilant about: firstly, maintaining the amount allocated to the Daphne programme and, secondly, ensuring that the name of this programme, which is widely known, will be kept in the future.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the crisis should, indeed, not be an excuse for a lack of investment in a solution to one of the main problems faced by the European Union as a whole. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the crisis is also an excuse, in many respects, to reinforce certain aspects that lead to even more violence against women. For me, this is, in fact, one of the fundamental debates that we have to tackle in this House, and not simply from an economic standpoint.</p>
      <p sl="es">It has been said, and it is true, that the violence also generates a significant economic cost. Beyond the economic cost generated by the violence and the obvious consequences, however, we are also going to debate this in depth, as has been proposed.</p>
      <p sl="es">This debate cannot be used for issues of an ideological nature, which can even result in the generation of a dynamic for the stigmatisation of women, which, in turn, will also obviously place them in a vulnerable situation and therefore make them more susceptible to violent situations, if that were possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">I insist that this is a good opportunity to continue debating what currently needs to be discussed, but without forgetting the underlying issue, which is the fundamental discrimination that women suffer in many parts of our society.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I very much support this European Parliament own-initiative report, and I take the view that it is still necessary to continue this important and, at the same time, highly successful programme. Small non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are the driving force in combating violence against women and children, but they often have problems with financing projects aimed at combating violence.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The important thing is for the victims to be provided with professional care in such difficult situations. I therefore take the view that these NGOs should have access to small but clearly targeted grants. I also often encounter the view that small organisations lack the specialists who could draw up the sort of high-quality project plans that would succeed in a tender, and the expertise. I therefore agree with some of the important measures contained in this report. At this point, I would particularly like to mention the equal distribution of programmes throughout the Member States, a reduction in the administrative burden, and simplification of the submission of applications for financial support and funding of the national projects that these small non-profit organisations are involved in.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Bastos for drafting this report. At a time when future priorities are being discussed, it is important to remember initiatives that have brought results. The Daphne programme is certainly one of them. The Daphne programme is extraordinary because it is able to reach those victims of violence that have been beyond the reach of other institutions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I mean women and children and adolescents who are exposed to violence due to social exclusion. However, violence is not always a physical blow. It can also be threats, psychological pressure, harassment or the dissemination of images depicting the sexual abuse of children. In particular, these forms of violence threaten the mental integrity of a person. Daphne enables projects to be funded that address the use of Internet networks for new forms of violence. More attention should be paid to prevention and also the financing of small organisations that tackle this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think it is important, as part of the Daphne programme’s incorporation into the rights and citizenship programme, that future initiatives receive a level of focus and funding similar to that provided throughout the previous three Daphne programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I particularly agree that renewed emphasis should be placed on small NGOs and non-profit organisations, whose participation is invaluable if we are to meet the programme’s aims. In my own home country, a number of organisations have participated in Daphne projects and Daphne-funded initiatives that have contributed to the prevention of violence against women, children and young people. These projects range from the Dignity initiative – in which the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigration Council of Ireland worked with European partners to attempt to raise the quality of services delivered to victims of sex trafficking – to helping establish and promote the pan-European 116000 Hotline for Missing Children. It is vital that the Union continues to support the good work carried out by these organisations and similar organisations all around Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Bastos, and the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, for drafting a very sound report and for their ongoing support for the Daphne programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the new multiannual financial framework, the Commission proposed to cover all the activities currently being supported and carried out by the Daphne programme with the future rights and citizenship programme. Let me answer directly the question that has been posed: under the new programme, all the current Daphne objectives and activities will be supported, and the budget in this new programme is compatible with the budget that was available up to now.</p>
      <p sl="en">The approach of the Commission under the multiannual financial framework focuses on simplification, flexibility and EU added value. Under the approach outlined, the Commission aims to develop the best possible synergies between three activities: combating violence, gender equality and the rights of the child. They are now brought under one programme, which will address emerging and innovative challenges, many of which are outlined in Ms Bastos’ report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to stress that the new programme remains open to all entities, all Member States and third countries, and all types of projects and activities that have been supported and are receiving funding under the Daphne III programme. The new structure of the programme will help the Commission to improve the programme’s management and to address more efficiently deficiencies as identified in the mid-term evaluation of the Daphne III programme, which are also noted in the report. This includes, for example, the need to improve dissemination of results and the geographic spread of projects. Participants will benefit directly from improved management of the programme because procedures will be easier, faster, less bureaucratic, more uniform. Something which required two procedures would now need one.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, in 2012, the Commission will update the Daphne toolkit. This database of projects to combat violence will facilitate the wider dissemination of news of project outcomes by European and national stakeholders. The intention is to maintain this database under the new multiannual financial framework programme and to use it as a model for the dissemination of project results in all areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finally stress, as the Commissioner for humanitarian aid, that we would have no foot to stand on morally if we assisted other countries to fight gender violence when we were not doing a good job at home. In this sense, I personally strongly support the report and the actions we take in this area. May I also say I am returning the two minutes that I took from our previous segment.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The aim of the Daphne programme is to protect children, young people and women from violence and to encourage health protection, wellness and social inclusion. The Daphne programme has succeeded in informing the public of those issues and in drawing attention to violence against women and children. The programme supports relevant organisations in progressing and also in achieving definite aims with the aid of practical policies such as recognising and sharing good practices, training and running information campaigns. However, I would like to draw attention to the Commission’s failure to implement across the Union the 116000 Hotline for Missing Children. Children are being put in danger as a result of that failure and the Daphne programme’s work is being undermined in relation to protecting children in all Member States. The hotline is a vitally important tool in protecting children. Currently, the service is not being implemented properly and I urge the Commission to address the operation of the hotline and its role in the Daphne programme.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The aim of the Daphne programme is to combat violence towards women, children and young people. In 2000, the Daphne initiative was transformed into a multiannual programme covering the period 2000-2003, and was allocated funding of EUR 20 million. The Daphne II and Daphne III programmes were launched in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with an average annual budget of EUR 10 million for Daphne II and EUR 16.7 million for Daphne III. Over 500 projects have been implemented since 1997 in a variety of fields, such as sexual, psychological or physical violence in families, schools and other institutions. I have to say, unfortunately, that the new Member States have so far accounted for only a negligible percentage of applications for funding from the Daphne programme. This might, of course, be also due to a lack of awareness among professionals regarding this programme. I would like to urge non-profit organisations, research institutes, public offices, schools and media, as well as all other bodies whose cooperation could be useful in combating violence against women, children and young people, to find out about this EU programme and push for it to be spread, and, in particular, made use of, more widely.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The Daphne programme is an important instrument for preventing and combating all forms of violence, as well as for encouraging international action within this area. During the past year I implemented a massive campaign promoting European programmes in Bulgaria including Daphne. I noticed that the lack of information in accessible language and of experience in implementing partner projects influences how active stakeholders are.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Given that Daphne targets one of our society’s serious problems – violence against women, children and young persons – I am of the opinion that the programme’s results have to be made public and used more widely, also with respect to the new risks associated with Internet usage. Violence against children and young people can cause deep psychological and physical trauma impacting their overall development, and we cannot remain indifferent and inactive. The distribution and exchange of information, experience and good practices, the creation of activity networks, campaigns for promoting public awareness and the setting up of hotlines for victims of violence are key measures that have to continue to receive support at European level.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the short presentation of the report by Norica Nicolai, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on women’s situation in war (2011/2198(INI)) (A7-0429/2011).</p>
    </intervention>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I do not believe that I will manage to cover every issue dealt with in the report in the next four minutes. However, I would like to highlight several matters which I regard as being vital.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This report is apt because, unfortunately, the use of rape as a weapon of war was invented by primitive societies, and here we also have it now as a weapon of war in modern, so-called ‘civilised’ societies. It is a topical issue with a significant impact, particularly in social terms, which can modify the pattern of behaviour and the way in which nations respond. Let us merely take the conflict in Congo as an example, where around 16 rapes a day have been recorded, proving that this problem has been far from tackled and eradicated.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the view of this report, there can be no peace without security and they can only be thought of as going hand in hand with each other. However, they can only be thought of in terms of equal opportunities and of a gender-based approach, jointly created by women and men as part of a partnership, which also concerns conflict prevention and the way in which conflict is conducted and, most of all, the activities involved in peacekeeping and resolving post-conflict situations. The European Union has endeavoured to take vital steps to prevent and tackle this problem. Unfortunately, national plans, as requested, are only available in 10 Member States, with five Member States in the process of devising these plans, proving that we have not made any progress yet and are behind in relation to the objectives we set ourselves. I believe that setting up the European External Action Service gives the European Union the chance to become much more involved in resolving this kind of problem. The report calls for the delegations which are negotiating peace and are involved in conflict to be selected using a gender-sensitive approach and for women to be included in these delegations because their perspective may be helpful in achieving much more quickly and more efficiently what is called peace and social calm.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another key point in the report concerns impunity. As I said, you cannot have justice without peace. However, unfortunately, the reality is that we have the problem of impunity. Although we can have recourse to the International Criminal Court, I believe that we need to find much more effective legal instruments. In a post-conflict situation, investigations need to be carried out and the perpetrators of these reprehensible criminal acts need to be brought to account because, in any other circumstance, we will end up seriously victimising the people who have suffered such acts and, if you like, society itself. I believe that this partnership between the European Union and the UN must be established not only through implementing Resolution 1960, but through other measures as well. I believe that the European Union has a duty to be a strong partner of the UN in tackling this problem. This is why we are calling for the post of Special EU Representative on Women, Peace and Security to be created within the EEAS. This is not an idle request. On the contrary, it is aimed at showing the European Union’s firm commitment to tackling this problem.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, we believe that a series of rules also need to be applied to those involved in the process of war and peace. We believe that Member States’ military structures must take into account a gender dimension, not only in terms of numbers, but particularly in terms of quality, because there are, fortunately, women in the European Union who are capable of coping with the highest positions in the military and in civilian life. To achieve this, Member States must consider the gender dimension in their military structures, which is a new issue.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thank you for your attention. As I said, I did not manage to cover all the topics, but please allow me to make one last point: I must thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the political groups because we all worked together on this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I congratulate you on your election as Vice-President and I congratulate Ms Nicolai on her excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is essential to guarantee the safety of women who choose to take up the courageous career of working in war situations. In many war zones around the world, sexual violence in the form of mass rapes and other forms of abuse such as human trafficking are often used as a war tactic, women being the main victims. These unacceptable acts have serious psychological and physical repercussions, especially with regard to women and their family members. We must condemn the perpetrators of criminal acts more severely. Impunity must not be negotiable and there should be no peace without justice. It is important to increase the participation of women in decision-making roles during peace processes and when it comes to defining security measures.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, only limited progress has been made in the last few decades on the participation of women in public administration. In some cases, quotas have been adopted and the number of women in representative institutions has grown. Despite these efforts, however, the participation of women in peace talks, with some exceptions, remains below 10%. Women in the military nevertheless play an important role as role models and mediators of intercultural exchange, and are also an encouraging motivation for local women, breaking down the stereotypes of local men and communicating better with local women.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In most countries, unfortunately, little importance is attached to gender equality and women’s rights because the gender issue is seen only as a minor issue, and cultural, religious and socio-economic customs are often taken as an excuse for hindering progress in this area. It is therefore necessary to emphasise the gender perspective early in the planning of civilian and security missions. The participation of women in the peace-building phase is extremely important.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think this is a crucial issue, not only because the role of women in war is important as victims and as targeted objectives in that situation, but also because of the role that women can play in peace-building.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rebuilding societies and changing some of the patterns that have brought some societies to war: this, to me, is one of the crucial issues that we have to underline – not only in the resolution, but also as the United Nations is doing in their Resolutions 1325 and 1820. That is also why it is so important that the European Union has a specific special representative for this issue. As has been said – and I fully support this – there is a huge opportunity for the European Union to put that issue at the forefront of the external dimension of these activities. This is, as has been said, not a minor issue, and it is a huge opportunity that we should not miss.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the appalling crimes committed under the cloak of military conflict against women and girls are a clear indication that their rights are not sufficiently protected, despite all efforts to date. Sexual violence in the form of mass rape, human trafficking and other forms of sexual abuse still form part of military tactics in conflict regions worldwide. We cannot tolerate such attacks on human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I therefore wholeheartedly agree with the rapporteur’s proposals concerning the introduction of a code of behaviour for people serving in military and civilian missions, clearly stating that sexual abuse constitutes unjustifiable and criminal behaviour. It will introduce strict penalties and zero tolerance vis-à-vis sexual abuse of children, girls and women in armed conflicts and in refugee camps. I support the proposals to strengthen the participation of women in leading political dialogue roles. The representation of women in international teams and in civilian and security missions should be a basic precondition for the provision of support within a peace process framework.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, during World Wars I and II, women lost their husbands and sons on the front. Today, women are the direct victims of conflicts. Removed from their homes, imprisoned and raped, women are particularly vulnerable in these situations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased that Parliament has finally called for acts of sexual violence in times of war to be considered war crimes. For this, we must recognise the remarkable work of our rapporteur, Ms Nicolai.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are two types of consequences for the victims: physical and psychological. However, these acts of violence also have a much wider impact: an impact on men, who have not been able to protect their wives, an impact on children, and an impact on the community. The effects of war therefore extend over time and across generations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome all of the solutions presented today in this report. Women have a role to play in conflict resolution and in political dialogues for peace. They have a role to play not only in civil conflict resolution missions, but also in military ones.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I believe that our Union will gain from having a Special Representative on Women, Peace and Security. My question, Commissioner, is the following: can you foresee the creation of such a position? If so, when?</p>

I agree with the rapporteur that war criminals who commit offences against women must be brought to trial more quickly, with impunity being non-negotiable in these cases. Unfortunately, in conflict situations currently going on around the world, violence is used against women as a war tactic and, regrettably, these cases most often remain unreported and unpunished. This is precisely why I believe that the European External Action Service must appoint a special observer with the job of protecting women in conflict zones and against any form of sexual or gender-based violence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Parliament has often been alarmed by the deteriorating situation, particularly in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and by the widespread impunity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I visited South Kivu, in particular, some time ago. I can testify to the gravity of the situation and the devastating physical and psychological consequences for women and young girls as a result of such acts. Let us not choose the wrong battle. In the face of such atrocities, reproductive and sexual health should be dealt with without taboo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union must grant a central place in its actions to reproductive and sexual health and the protection of women’s rights in terms of sexuality during times of war. We know that rape is a crime. During war, it is a war crime. Therefore, women – we must always remember – are not an instrument of war.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Nicolai, most sincerely. Thank you, too, for the scheduling of this item immediately after we talked about a similar issue here in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the European Union, we take very seriously the issue of the role of women and, in particular, the role of women in peace and security through implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and other related resolutions. Our approach is a comprehensive one: we bring this concern to all our external instruments and all related policies and programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2008, the EU adopted a comprehensive approach on the implementation of two resolutions – 1325 and 1820 – covering the whole range of policy tools available to it during and after conflict. The approach is based on the ‘three Ps’ of Resolution 1325: women’s participation, protection and the prevention of violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say a word here about funding. We have the EU Instrument for Stability, which is a key instrument that we can apply for stabilising measures and capacity-building measures. In this instrument we have fully mainstreamed the gender perspective; and protection of the most vulnerable – the most vulnerable in humanitarian catastrophes being children, women, the handicapped and the elderly – is often a key objective of what I do as Commissioner for humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">We support the protection of women, especially in conflict zones, through our humanitarian aid instrument, but we also support the empowerment of women through cash-for-work programmes that specifically target women in conflict zones. I will be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in three weeks’ time and my main objective will indeed be this issue: the issue that is the topic of this report, the protection of women, and specifically stopping the rape of women as an instrument of war. Overall, the EU is active in more than 70 countries, and the EU institutions and Member States have reported allocating a total of approximately EUR 200 million in 2009 and early 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the EU common security and defence policy (CSDP). Most CSDP missions and operations include a human rights and gender exercise. We now have a package of three fully fledged training modules on human rights, gender and child protection in the context of CSDP, which are being finalised in 2012. We also work very closely with the EU military staff in order to have a good common understanding of all the humanitarian aspects in conflicts, but, in particular, of how conflicts affect the most vulnerable – among them, women.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we do a lot on the external side, it is also important to perform well internally by appointing women negotiators or mediators. By appointing more women in key positions in the European External Action Service, our Member States are the most proactive in the UN context. Thirteen of the EU Member States have adopted national action plans. Others, like Germany, have come up with special initiatives on women, peace and security. The first EU report on the indicators that measured the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 was finalised in May 2011. It shows that the EU has taken concrete steps to enhance protection of the most vulnerable groups, including women.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can be proud of our efforts but we still need to be vigilant and go on working in all forums and in all countries to tackle sexual violence in conflicts and to ensure women’s meaningful participation in peace processes and public representation.</p>
      <p sl="en">To respond to the question on whether the EU is considering appointing a special representative, Vice-President/High Representative Ashton announced in December that she is looking into the creation of the post of EU special representative for human rights, and is considering the definition of this function.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I enthusiastically support the idea of creating the position of special representative on women, peace and security within the European External Action Service, as recommended in the report on women’s situation in war voted on today. This would help the European External Action Service to mainstream the equality perspective as part of external policy, especially as wars and conflict are an issue. At present, fewer than 10% of peace negotiators are women, although peace is in the interests of everyone – men and women.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Wars and conflict affect women in many ways. One of the most brutal practices is sexual violence as a form of warfare. It affects everything: the victim’s physical and mental health, family relations, and her entire future. In the majority of cases, the guilty go unpunished. The victim, on the other hand, lives with it all her life.</p>

      <p sl="en">In order to encourage their participation in situations of war, women must be visible contributors to the prevention, mediation and resolution of conflicts. Beyond engaging in behind-the-scenes roles, assuming leadership roles is key to building upon the foundation of gender equality. As women account for half of the EU population, it is logical that their participation in these three phases mirrors this statistic. Aside from this simple democratic principle, what is perhaps the strongest argument for women’s participation is the unique perspective they bring to the table and the message their empowerment sends to the world. Women need to be better represented in the military, for example, not just to fill a proportional requirement, but also because they interact and communicate more effectively with local women. On the other spectrum, local women’s empowerment must be strengthened. Education is a crucial means through which local women can gain integrity and be better equipped to engineer preventive measures against war and violence in their communities. In addition to the active participation of a proportional representation of women at the negotiation table, women’s knowledge is also critical in the peace-building process as women are more aware of the challenges faced by their communities.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is a short presentation of the report by Evelyn Regner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission under Rule 138 of the Rules of Procedure, on a 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats (2011/2046(INI)) (A7-0008/2012).</p>

    <intervention id="4-078-000" speaker_id="96998" name="Evelyn Regner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for working together so constructively. I would particularly like to thank Mr Lehne and Ms Thein, but also Mr Boulland, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, who contributed interesting, very useful aspects relating to the transfer plan and the participation of employees and their representatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">The draft report was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, and the opinion was adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with an overwhelming majority. That should therefore serve as a wake-up call to the Commission to finally table legislation, because we are dealing with sensitive matters here: the issue of company seats and that of worker participation.</p>
      <p sl="de">A limited company that wishes to move its seat from one EU Member State to another faces a challenge. In legal terms, it has to dismantle its organisation completely in order to build it up again in another Member State. It has to give up its legal personality – and that in 2012, when we are supposed to have an internal market. That costs time and money and no little irritation; there are also social costs associated with it. There is therefore a real gap in the legislation, and the European Parliament is aware of that. It has also repeatedly called on the Commission in the past to finally table legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are the consequences for enterprises? They simply take flight. Competition has arisen between the corporate forms that exist under national legislation – limited company versus Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung , to name just one of many examples. They rush into mergers; in other words, there is a race to the bottom. I do not want that. We do not want a ‘Delaware effect’. That means we need a directive: a 14th company law directive on the transfer of company seats. However, company seats should be transferred properly, not cowboy fashion. I do not want companies to frantically decamp – with half of them getting lost along the way. Enterprises must not be allowed to more or less erase all traces of their existence and abandon their commitments in the Member State they are leaving when they transfer their company seat.</p>
      <p sl="de">This brings us to the two main issues here. I will start with the matter of employees’ participation. Employees’ participation contributes to the enduring success of companies. Employee rights in line with the Community acquis – that is what my report calls for. That means respecting the right to information and consultation, as well as codetermination by employees and their representatives. De facto this means – and I call on the Commission to do this – that where appropriate, negotiations on rescue arrangements are required to protect existing codetermination rights. I already have a best practice example in mind here. We already have rules in connection with the European company.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us now move on to the second hot potato that we are dealing with here: the issue of registered offices and administrative seats. Within the European Union, there are countries that allow separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company, and there are those that do not. Allowing such separation encourages the avoidance of mandatory protective standards that apply in the country in which the company has its administrative seat – in other words, the centre of its operations.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report sets out that we do not want companies to be tax exiles or to misuse post-box offices with a view to circumventing legal, social and fiscal conditions. What we want is a practical solution. In the report, we have found a Solomon-like solution. Commissioner, please ask Commissioner Barnier – who has responsibility for this – to at last act on this and, in so doing, to concentrate on the key issue, on the intra-Community transfers of seats; in other words, on those political areas which, in the final event, all the Member States can agree on. It should be based on economic activity in the state to which the company is relocating.</p>
      <p sl="de">The internal market has a contribution to make to economic growth – something we need now more than ever. Please do not delay, then, in finally tabling a proposal; and please do not repeat the mistakes made when the European company was set up.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, cross-border company migration is one of the crucial elements in the completion of the internal market, and Articles 49 and 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guarantee European companies the freedom to become established anywhere within the European Union. However, the lack of consistent legislation on transfers and on procedures for transferring a company’s registered office and the associated risk in terms of employment, the administrative difficulties, the costs incurred, the social implications and the lack of legal certainty all hamper the transfer process.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call on the Commission to table a proposal for a directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats, so that the transfer takes place only after a company’s management or board of directors planning a transfer has drafted a transfer plan on which the relevant company’s employees have also been consulted. I think that the e-government services and single points of contact created under the Services Directive can ease the administrative burden of company transfers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I very much appreciate what Ms Regner has done and support her call. The legislative initiative on the issue of the transfer of company seats is very necessary. Freedom of entrepreneurship is important, but if a company seat is transferred without also moving the other activities of the company to the new location at the same time, unfair practices are usually at work. In most cases, this is an attempt to avoid tax obligations or to circumvent labour law in the home country.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The creation of so-called mailbox companies, with which we also have experience in the EU Member States, is certainly an undesirable phenomenon that needs to be addressed. Of course, legislation should be able to discern and should not prevent honest companies from changing location if necessary and provided there is a legitimate reason. A good control mechanism promoted by our grouping is to involve company employees in decision making on the cross-border transfer of company seats, for example, through their effective participation in the boards of companies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Ms Regner and the Committee on Legal Affairs for the report on the cross-border transfer of company seats. The timing of the report is very appropriate, as the Commission will launch, in February, a public consultation on the future of EU company law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The process was initiated with a conference in May 2011, which brought together practitioners, scholars and experts from a variety of backgrounds, including from this House, to discuss key company law issues. A group of experts established by the Commission provided a report for this conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, the Commission has continued its reflections and decided to involve a larger circle of EU citizens in the work by launching a public consultation. The issue of companies’ cross-border mobility, including, but not limited to, the question of a directive on the cross-border transfer of companies’ registered offices, is an integral part of this. The public consultation will contain detailed questions on the need and conditions for a possible directive, as well as its likely effects. The view expressed in the report today will fit into this process in a valuable way. So many thanks again to the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not the first time Parliament has called on the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats. The Commission has already openly engaged in a dialogue on the need for such a directive, which would have to bring real value for the companies and for the internal market. Clearly, this is not a topic that has disappeared from the Commission’s radar.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are two specific issues in this context that require careful consideration. I am referring here to the separation between a registered office of administration, on the one hand, and to employees’ participation, on the other. The negotiations on the European private company statute have shown once again how difficult it is to find compromises on these issues between Member States. The Commission finds the report very balanced regarding these issues and we are grateful for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission looks forward to continuing the constructive dialogue with Parliament on the important issue of corporate mobility in general, and the directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats in particular. I can assure you that Commissioner Barnier will take full ownership of the follow-up of the discussion we have had in this House today. The Commission plans to finalise its reflection on this issue in the course of this year.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I believe that in essence, the 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats serves to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness. A prerequisite of competitiveness is dynamic and flexible company law. As we could see, not even an extensive interpretation of the most important judgments is sufficient to dispel all doubts that have arisen in connection with the freedom of establishment and ensure full legal certainty. Yet this is exactly what business life needs. Unlike restrictions, however, a regulatory competition arising at the level of company and fiscal law as a result of the freedom to choose seats could promote the competitiveness of the EU as a whole. As enterprises are free to choose where to have their seats, Member States will have to adapt their regulations in line with one another in order to avoid an exodus of companies choosing more favourable legal conditions. This would lead to indirect harmonisation within the Community. The question that remains is where do we go from here. By now, it has become clear that any criticism questioning the future and raison d’être of this directive on a level of principles has proven to be unfounded. It is also apparent, however, that the regulatory framework established is not without faults. Its future fate will be determined by its usefulness and actual use.</p>

      <p sl="de">I hope that today’s own-initiative report will be interpreted by the Commission in the way it was written by Parliament, because a directive on the transfer of company seats could have considerable negative effects on the rules on corporate codetermination. That applies not just to Germany, but throughout the European Union. The transfer of a company’s registered office could result in the loss of codetermination at corporate level. Transferring the company’s registered office to another country could allow the rules on corporate codetermination in Germany to be circumvented. At present, employees’ codetermination in a company is based on the Member State in which the company has its registered office. We are not talking about a nominal registered office; rather, the company must be registered where it actually has a genuine presence, such as business premises, employees, etc. In other words, it must have a genuine link with the state in which it is registered. We cannot allow the directive on transfers of company seats to be used to circumvent the rights of employees and creditors through the establishment of post-box offices abroad. If separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company is allowed, then social rights could effectively be eroded – and that is something we have to prevent. This can only work if the registered office of a company is in the country where it is actually based. That is the way to safeguard effectively the rights of employees in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope the Commission will safeguard social Europe, and the rights of its citizens, in its draft legislation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is a short presentation of the report by Norbert Neuser, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on EU development cooperation in support of the objective of universal energy access by 2030 (2011/2012(INI)) (A7-0442/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-089-000" speaker_id="96844" name="Norbert Neuser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of 2012 is a timely occasion for the report on universal energy access, as the United Nations General Assembly has designated 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All.</p>
      <p sl="de">To me and to all my fellow Members who worked with me on this report in committee, two facts are particularly important. The first is that we want renewable energy. The second is that we want everyone to have access to these new sources of energy. Consequently, these sources of energy must be affordable by everyone.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Committee on Development, we worked together very constructively, including with NGOs. In this connection, particular mention must be made of the London-based organisation, Practical Action, and of Sweden’s Stockholm Environment Institute. Our secretariat also provided us with vigorous support in finding ways in which we can forge ahead with universal access to renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to clarify once more what we are talking about here. At present, 1.3 billion people live without electricity. A total of 2.7 billion people use biomass to cook, on improvised stoves. The vast majority of these live in rural areas, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and India. To give just one example: 20% of the population of Kenya has access to the grid, but only 5% of the rural population.</p>
      <p sl="de">Access to energy brings not only light and power, but also – and above all – cooking facilities and heating. Yet access to energy is still not a Millennium Development Goal. Without access to it, however, it will be difficult to achieve our Millennium Development Goals. That is why we call in the report for renewable energy to be included in the post-2015 MDGs.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is hard to see how schools, training facilities, health centres and hospitals could exist or function without electricity. Cooking and heating with biomass causes millions of deaths each year in shacks, as a result of harmful smoke. Many of Africa’s governments have therefore banned the use of coal for cooking and heating, for climate and health reasons. In practice, however, those responsible have to look the other way when coal is produced and sold.</p>
      <p sl="de">We very much welcome the fact that, in its Agenda for Change, the Commission has included energy as a guiding priority. Allow me, therefore, to summarise our key demands in the report once more. We call on the EU and the Member States to support the UN goals of universal access to energy by 2030 and to align their policies accordingly. We call on the Commission to focus on small, local renewable energy projects, because only then will it be possible to reach the majority of the population. More money should be made available for this. The European Investment Bank and the other European development banks are not geared towards small, local energy projects. That has to change; universal energy access should be prominently represented in the Rio+20 process. Finally, universal energy access should be included as a Millennium Development Goal post-2015.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, improving access to energy services helps enhance people’s quality of life. This is a necessity, in particular, for people who live in poverty. In this regard, energy access ought to become a priority as part of the debate on eradicating poverty. I should point out that difficulties in accessing modern energy services put women and children in particular at a disadvantage.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support the inclusion of this problem on the Rio+20 summit agenda in June. I endorse the notion of devising a specific EU-level energy and development programme. At the same time, private investment must be encouraged, so as to make these services more accessible to the public. I should stress the importance of funding for projects involving renewable electricity sources. For example, in Romania, producers of green energy are due to receive EUR 300 million this year from green certificates.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to mention that access to renewable energy should really be a European objective, and an objective not only for Europe, but for the whole world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have undoubtedly made fantastic technological progress in renewable energy. Such progress was unthinkable 20 years ago, so making access to renewable energy one of our goals for 2015 is very appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are all aware of the destruction of part of the forests of sub-Saharan Africa in order for its biomass to be used as the one and only fuel. New solutions need to be devised. However, in Europe, too, we have, in large measure, based renewable energy and its funding on being completely paid for by users. This is now under attack from everyone, in particular, because of the crisis that we are experiencing and the nuclear lobby. We therefore support the Commission in these measures.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I recently took part in a debate on EU and US energy policy. I can state that the Americans are much better at this than the EU, because they have a clear, well-advised plan progressing through to the level of tactical steps, which is what is lacking with us.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, what the European Union most needs right now is diversification of sources. This involves targeting new forms of alternative energy, such as genetic manipulation of bacteria, where research is under way in the US, for example, into the direct production of diesel through this technique. It also involves strengthening interconnectivity and building up reserves. In my opinion, this is an option we have neglected so far.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the work of Mr Norbert Neuser, in which he proposes the establishment and building of small, decentralised projects to support the generation of electricity in developing countries, is of interest. It is a very ambitious and interesting project. I believe, however, that the EU does not have sufficient capacity to force through and promote this project more widely. Perhaps, however, the EU could be the initiator of such a project at a global level with the support of industrialised and developing countries, which could raise the funds to really get such a project helping developing countries off the ground on a much larger scale and scope, so that something can be done in this area.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, among developing countries, energy poverty represents a serious issue. Nearly 1.3 billion people worldwide regularly go without electricity in their everyday lives.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that so far, this issue has not been given sufficient weight among development priorities. Access to modern energy services is an essential requirement of eradicating poverty, yet there are few developing countries that can demonstrate any progress in improving access to energy. Households usually spend large proportions of their income on low-quality lighting and heating materials. The reason for this is that those without access to fuel and electricity do not receive subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Today, there is already a range of technologies available that could give poor communities access to clean and efficient energy. Technologies that make use of local energy sources in addition to fossil fuels could also offer a solution. The creation of a global financial fund that would allow us to support investments aimed at mitigating poverty should be facilitated. We must do everything in our power, both at a political level and in terms of financial support, to ensure universal access to energy by 2030.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, about 1.3 billion people worldwide – 84% of whom live in rural areas – have no access to electricity, while 2.7 billion people are without any clean cooking facilities, a situation that creates indoor smoke which is responsible for more than 1.4 million premature deaths every year.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The task of improving energy access requires an estimated annual investment of USD 48 billion by 2030, which is equivalent to around 3% of the global investment in energy infrastructure projected over the period until then. I think that providing universal access to modern, sustainable energy services is a prerequisite for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I also support the inclusion of universal energy access in these objectives from 2015. At the Rio+20 summit, the EU should propose concrete targets for eradicating energy poverty and a road map for achieving them.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, access to modern energy services is a fundamental prerequisite for poverty reduction and stable, sustainable human development. Without access to energy, whole communities are constrained to a life of poverty under undignified conditions. Substantial efforts have been made to foster private investment for energy access in recent years. However, aside from the economies in transition, very few developing countries can demonstrate progress on scaling-up access to energy for the poor. Financial assistance to energy access for this group of the population has been modest, and it is therefore necessary to increase private sector involvement.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Regarding the future, globally, the Energy Facility provides the only fund specifically focused on supporting investments to challenge energy poverty. Yet currently, there is no commitment to the future EU Energy Facility. I therefore believe that, by enhancing political will and financial commitment in particular, the EU can take up a decisive position in achieving universal energy access by 2030.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes the report by Mr Neuser and we clearly see eye to eye. We are equally committed to ensuring that the target of universal energy access by 2030 is fulfilled and that renewable energy increases its contribution to meeting this target.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are all aware of the fundamental role that energy plays as a driver for development and an underpinning factor in delivering health, education, food security and economic growth, as well as the fact that clean energy brings additional benefits by reducing air pollution and the associated risk to public health. The recommendations of the report are fully in line with the strategies adopted by the Commission, such as the Agenda for Change, which recognises the unique role energy can play with regard to development.</p>
      <p sl="en">We participate strongly in the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Commissioner Piebalgs is leading a working group under the high-level panel set up by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. This initiative aims to create the concrete conditions for success in the two most pressing and, may I add, increasingly interconnected challenges mankind is confronted with: reducing poverty and combating climate change. Sustainable Energy for All will decisively contribute to both.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been playing a strong and active role in these very early discussions and we, the EU, are rightly seen as one of the leading players, if not the leading player, in making the initiative a success. This is because of our collective role as the world’s leading donor – 60% of development cooperation funding comes from the European Union – and because of our voice in international financial institutions such as the World Bank. As a former World Bank staff member, I can confirm that it was Europe which pressured the World Bank to adopt its first ever renewable energy targets. We are also the only set of countries already committed to achieving the headline goals on energy efficiency and renewable energy. We have the Rio+20 summit coming up, with the unique opportunity it can give us to come up with new initiatives. I am sure Commissioner Piebalgs would look into ways of making that area one of the fields for funding commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also strong recognition on our side of the role this House has played in adopting and implementing legislation to further the objectives presented in this report. We recognise the key role of renewable-base decentralised solutions in providing the poor with access to energy, and I see this when I travel to poor countries like Niger and Chad. We obviously have to be very determined in pursuing renewable energy solutions. We must also recognise that these countries have needs in connection with access to water, hence the importance of having water storage capacity. In other words, we can achieve multiple objectives by pursuing decentralised solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">A specific communication on universal energy access is not envisaged in 2012, but I believe we should do better than a communication. Through the active role the Union will play in the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, we can turn this into a practical action that delivers access to energy services in a sustainable way by 2030.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of the initiative, we are working on a mechanism to enable developing countries to opt in to a scheme whereby they would receive the necessary technical and expert assistance to develop their own national energy access strategy. This would ensure real commitment from partner countries, thus allowing conditions that enable the delivery of private investment to materialise, and I can see that Mr Neuser shares this analysis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes we can deliver these results together. I am very grateful to this House for its support, and grateful too for the support that the Committee on Development has always shown during our work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The lack of access to electricity is not only a serious problem at a global level, affecting around 1.3 billion people, but even in some European Union Member States, too. In Romania, for example, many isolated rural areas are not connected to the electricity grid, which has resulted in an alarming level of depopulation in the localities in these parts of the country. In fact, the lack of roads or sewage systems also causes rural areas to be abandoned. In these circumstances, it is important to retain the second pillar as part of the future common agricultural policy, which is devoted to rural development and, in particular, to maintain, as part of it, the opportunity for funding investments in infrastructure, whether it be electricity, gas or road.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Energy services influence every aspect of people’s lives and the sources of people’s support. Without unrestricted access to these services, societies are forced to live in want. Worldwide, about 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. This is a huge problem for the countries of the developing world. However, apart from this, there is also another problem, which affects the people living in the European Union itself and, in particular, the Union’s new Member States, and this concerns the restricted access to electricity caused by the high costs of this form of energy. This phenomenon occurs mainly in rural areas, and this is why it is of such great importance to strengthen the EU Energy Facility, which supports marginalised rural areas and people living in isolated communities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Supporting renewable energy sources and investing in them should become the main work of the Union in this area. The objective is obvious: to ensure inexpensive energy services for the poor, and particularly for all people in non-urban areas. In Central and Eastern Europe, including in countries such as Lithuania, many hectares of land are not under cultivation. By supporting initiatives to derive energy from biofuels, we would gain a triple benefit: cheaper energy, restoration of agricultural production and a reduction in unemployment through the creation of new jobs in the agriculture sector. The role of the Union should be to draw up clear guidelines on criteria for funding and supporting the production of biofuels and alternative energy sources.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is a short presentation of the report by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual tax report (2011/2271(INI)) (A7-0014/2012).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-105-000" speaker_id="4274" name="Olle Schmidt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, it was with a high degree of humility that I took on the task as rapporteur for this report, the first annual tax report. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all groups for the constructive debate that we had on this difficult but important subject. I have tried to incorporate comments from all groups, and I think that we have been able to achieve a high level of agreement. I hope this report will receive broad support here in this Chamber today.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The subject of taxes and tax policy is one that affects people. Tax policy generates emotion – both positive and negative. There are conflicting aims within tax policy, and we always have to find a balance between them. We know that it is not the easiest thing to do. For decades, tax policy has been regarded as an exclusively national matter in which the EU has no part to play. That time is past, however. As a consequence of globalisation, tax issues also need to be discussed at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The report aims to examine the areas where further coordination of taxes – in certain areas perhaps even tax harmonisation – may be necessary, and where the EU can play an important role. Comprehensive and lasting budgetary consolidation is needed, because the ongoing debt crisis is also a tax crisis. The lack of coordination of tax policy is contributing to a deepening of the crisis. The necessary, but painful, reduction of debt requires expenditure restraints, increased cuts in public spending and also tax rises.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This report focuses on areas where the EU can do more to improve the functioning of the internal market and to make Europe more competitive. Unfortunately, companies and citizens within the EU are still encountering tax obstacles. We need to remove these obstacles in order to create economic growth and more jobs. In order to be able to do that, we need to reduce taxes on earnings and increase taxes on consumption, for example.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also hope that the report will be able to put pressure on the Member States to adopt the tax proposals that the Commission has put forward, including the introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). We need to resolve the tax problems that people encounter in their day-to-day lives; for example, if they live in one country and work in another and are affected by double taxation. Tax treaties between Member States are, in themselves, not enough to eradicate double taxation. This is a consequence of the lack of a consistent interpretation of the treaties between the countries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Several cases of double taxation are currently being examined in the Committee on Petitions. One example concerns an Italian lorry driver who works in Germany and was taxed in both Italy and Germany. He had to pay a total of 60% of his wages in tax, despite the fact that he should only have been taxed in Germany and should only have paid 25% in tax. This happened despite there being a tax treaty between Germany and Italy and despite the fact that the tax authorities have established that this is an error. As far as I know, this case is still not fully resolved, unfortunately. We need a common EU policy in this area and joint legislation that is able to make a distinction. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has recently adopted a communication on double taxation, which also presents practical measures.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Tax evasion, fraud and lack of transparency cost the EU and its Member States many billions of euro in lost tax revenue every year. I am particularly concerned about the exploitation of loopholes in European legislation, whereby international companies operating within the EU attempt to avoid paying tax within the Union. The aim must be for every euro in tax that is intentionally withheld from the state through clever tax arrangements to be paid to the tax authority in future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In closing, I would just like to say that paragraph 11, which concerns fiscal federalism, has caused a certain amount of confusion. Allow me to read the original proposal in English, which came from my Basque and Catalan colleagues, among others:</p>
      <p sl="sv">‘Believes that fiscal federalism is the best tool in order to achieve self-responsibility in tax management at regional level and so entails higher economic efficiency’. That refers to paragraph 11.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, it is definitely welcome that the European Parliament is providing its opinion on current European tax policy issues. The report correctly assesses the importance of the coordination of tax policies in terms of information exchange, as the absence of such coordination could, in the long term, indeed entail a lack of transparency in taxation and the risk of tax evasion. However, this, in itself, means far more than a deficit of millions of euro because, in time, the very single market and the unimpeded operation of cross-border companies could be at risk.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It must be noted, however, that while tax policy rightly continues to remain within national competence, Member States must cooperate in making their tax policies, which also represent major budgetary revenues to them, transparent and comparable, and must also cooperate in making both the tax collection system and the tax planning strategies applied measurable and comparable.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, in order for Europe to be competitive in terms of its various tax policies in combating tax evasion and double taxation, it needs to involve not only the OECD but also the European Community itself more actively.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Schmidt for his excellent report and for the constructive cooperation that we enjoyed. He made reference to the euro crisis – the debt crisis – which compels us all to consider how we can better integrate our economy. It goes without saying that, when it comes to taxation, too, we need to better integrate with each other, especially within the euro area, but also within the European Union as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For my group, this implies fairer taxation. It means eliminating tax evasion and avoidance internally within the European Union, but, of course, it also means a joint strategy for the European Union vis-à-vis third countries. In that connection, we are also arguing for a joint European approach to solving this problem, in other words, agreements between the European Union and Switzerland and other third countries, rather than between the individual Member States of the Union and countries like Switzerland.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, we also need measures such as a shifting of taxation from work to the environment and assets, Community taxation instruments such as a financial transaction tax and, finally, a harmonisation of tax scales, specifically with regard to corporation tax. I think that that is very important indeed.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I wish to express my satisfaction that Parliament, through this annual tax report, has supported the principle of fiscal federalism that forms part of the economic agreement between the Basque country and Navarre. Devolved income generating powers, as well as devolved spending powers, promote responsibility, prevent deficit, and encourage the development of effective policies to support a productive economy. Likewise, support for Member State legislation in this matter is essential for the regions that already have fiscal powers devolved and for those that are calling for them to be devolved.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our support for the principle of fiscal federalism is enhanced by our agreement with the principles of financial stability, our support for the economic governance package and for tax harmonisation. We would, however, like the regional and state tax systems to be treated in the same manner, given that in the Basque country, we experience the paradox of facing sanctions from Europe for applying tax incentives identical to those employed during the same period by some Member States against whom penalty proceedings have not even been started. I am all for harmonisation, but it should be applied across the board.</p>

    <intervention id="4-111-000" speaker_id="96654" name="Jaroslav Paška" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I agree with Mr Schmidt that tax evasion is a serious problem for the European Union and that we must address the coordination of tax policies. I am not sure that we can proceed to tax harmonisation straight away. I think that those State competences are strong enough and that many countries are not interested in moving towards such a procedure.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I do believe, however, that we could start to work on a common account plan. I think that it is necessary to create common, multilingual accounting forms that would be accepted and assessed in different languages by different tax offices in the individual countries. Then, on the basis of harmonised accounting procedures and accounting forms, we could start to discuss how to define a common tax base, which it may be appropriate to define.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I think that taxes will remain in the competences and, I might add, interests of the individual countries for a long time to come, and I believe that this will also have to be respected.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we can only have a perfectly functioning single market if the 500 million inhabitants of the European Union enjoy all EU rights. Unfortunately, we have seen in reality that our citizens face many obstacles when it comes to cross-border activities, unacceptable obstacles which may compromise the very idea of a single market in the European Union. At a time highlighted by a high level of mobility among European citizens, I think that special rules need to be adopted immediately for cross-border and mobile workers, which take into account the interaction of tax and social security systems in different Member States. I think that better coordination and cooperation between tax administrations in Member States will help remove cross-border fiscal obstacles and harmonise national regulations, something which the European Union’s citizens and companies very much need.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in Europe and, in this context, the automatic stabilisers of the welfare state become more relevant than ever. Effective taxation is of fundamental importance for public authorities so that they can fulfil their tasks and obligations as well as citizens’ expectations. Sound fiscal consolidation, together with fairer and more targeted distribution of the tax burden, is necessary to ensure fiscal credibility. The reduction of debt requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, especially for high income groups. Growth-oriented tax changes must be given priority. Only in this way will the foundations for long-term growth be created.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore necessary to try to apply procedures that help prevent tax avoidance and tax abuse. Last but not least, we must also increase transparency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as a shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on this subject, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Schmidt on the extraordinary work that he has done. This area often features ideology and myriad choices, yet he has managed to achieve a broad consensus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report deals with these matters, but also raises the many new challenges that we are facing in terms of tax harmonisation, business taxation and the level of taxation which the Member States are imposing right now, at a time of financial crisis. The matter of tax competition within Europe and with third countries is absolutely crucial.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union must have competitive tax systems as a way of attracting wealth and investment to the Union, which is in such need of it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the core function of tax systems is to finance public services, such as education, health care, public transport and infrastructure, to protect public goods and reduce social inequalities by ensuring a more balanced distribution of income and wealth. Tax policies must aim to foster economic growth, job creation, increased EU competitiveness and lower costs for businesses, particularly SMEs. Effective taxation helps public authorities fulfil their obligations as well as citizens’ expectations. The Commission and Member States must continue their cooperation against double taxation, tax fraud and tax evasion in order to increase transparency and reduce loopholes and uncertainties for businesses and citizens with regard to tax collection. I should stress the importance of the initiative on introducing e-invoices and the equal treatment from 2013 of VAT for e-invoices and paper invoices, as well as of e-government services with regard to the efficiency and transparency of tax collection.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the lack of coordination of tax policies at EU level poses an obstacle to cross-border transactions and investments. It can also give rise to evasion, abuses and fraud. Europe needs a fiscal consolidation strategy, and tax obstacles that affect cross-border mobility must be removed. I support the Commission’s initiative of setting up a working group on double taxation issues. I should emphasise that this mechanism adds to the global fiscal burden and has an adverse impact on capital investments. It jeopardises the competitiveness of European companies in the medium and long term. Double taxation conventions may help resolve these problems. According to a recent study, bilateral portfolio investments can increase by up to 50% after adopting such a convention. Romania has signed double taxation conventions with 90 countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for putting tax policy high on its political agenda as demonstrated by this first annual tax report and, particularly to thank Mr Schmidt, not only for the constructive tone of the report, but for setting the standard high for others to follow. On behalf of the Commission, I would also like to welcome the broad support for the Commission’s initiatives and the valuable suggestions made for our future work. Let me address specific points in more detail.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, in the current economic climate, clearly the European Union needs a more pro-growth, pro-jobs tax policy. In the 2012 Annual Growth Survey: Launching the European Semester, the Commission outlined ways towards growth-friendly tax reform and fiscal consolidation in Member States. In the short term, shifting taxation away from labour towards consumption and polluting activities, in addition to cutting unjustified tax expenditure, could contribute to much-needed growth. Furthermore, it will be important to improve the tax environment for businesses. In this respect, I would like to highlight our commitment to an EU VAT system with a single set of simple and clear rules providing businesses with more accessible and better information, and creating a new VAT forum: these are some of the actions we have planned in our recent communication for a new VAT regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also very much welcome the support for our proposal on the common consolidated corporate tax base. This proposal will contribute to achieving many goals you seek, such as reducing administrative costs and red tape for companies, especially for small businesses operating across borders. It will help to remove discrimination and double taxation. In this respect, and as a complement to the CCCTB, the Commission is committed to further examining the potential for a binding dispute resolution mechanism covering double taxation, and many of you have spoken about it.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the Commission is not only aiming to make life easier for businesses and provide advantages to them. In the current economic climate, tackling the causes for Member States’ tax base erosion is of particular importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, I am very glad to see very strong support to our efforts to fight tax fraud and tax evasion, but also to tackle double non-taxation of large companies that artificially shift profits to minimise the effective tax rate. Very soon, the Commission intends to launch a public consultation on double non-taxation in order to establish the full scale of the problem, and to get information about existing schemes and possible solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the end of this year, the Commission will present a comprehensive initiative to further address issues highlighted in the report, such as tax havens, aggressive tax planning and double non-taxation. I also very much welcome the support for our communication on removing cross-border tax obstacles for EU citizens and for our efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between Member States in order to prevent such obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you can see, the Commission’s thinking reflected in our ongoing and planned initiatives is very much in line with the issues raised in the report and by Members today. I am really delighted to see that Parliament agrees on the importance of an EU-coordinated tax policy as an essential element in our strategy to move out of this crisis towards a better future for our citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="4-121-000" speaker_id="2323" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Martin Ehrenhauser, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the budgetary control of EU humanitarian aid managed by ECHO (2011/2073(INI)) (A7-0444/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-122-000" speaker_id="39769" name="Martin Ehrenhauser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, humanitarian aid is a very, very important matter. Together, the European Union and its Member States are the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. The Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) administers around 36% of these resources, which, in 2010, amounted to around EUR 1.1 billion. ECHO merely plays a coordinating role in this, while implementation on the ground is generally carried out by partners; this means that NGOs, UN agencies – in some cases – and international organisations are responsible for implementation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that humanitarian aid is intended for the world’s most needy people, and therefore any inefficiency and ineffectiveness costs human lives. That was the starting point for my own-initiative report. After seven years, it is high time that the European Parliament reinvestigated the effectiveness and efficiency of control mechanisms, monitoring mechanisms and, in the final event, the implementation of the aid concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where cooperation between DG ECHO and the NGOs is concerned, it can be stated that, overall, DG ECHO ensures a very high degree of accountability. Very good continuous dialogue takes place between the NGOs and DG ECHO. Moreover, the 2008 framework partnership agreement has brought definite progress. This is being revised this year, and naturally we should continue along this path. It is also important that we focus in future on reducing administrative expenses.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am somewhat more critical of our cooperation with the UN. Here, serious shortcomings can be found in the joint budget implementation method as regards reliable control of the management of financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, the ‘single audit’ principle is basically correct. Nonetheless, we have to emphasise transparency. That means, firstly, that the European Parliament should have access to all the UN audit reports. This is not the case at present. In my opinion, the European Parliament is unable to discharge its duties as a control body adequately as a result.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the narrative reports sent to the Commission in respect of implementation are worded very vaguely, in my view, where results are concerned. They should contain more substance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we come to the matter of UN reform. This reform was initiated following the scandal involving the government of North Korea. In respect of transparency and accountability, no progress has yet been made. The Member States surely have a duty to exert more pressure on the UN in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where implementation by NGOs is concerned, there are a few weak areas – particularly as regards the contract award procedure of certain NGOs. These are not adequate and, in some cases, NGOs do not have a contract award procedure at all. Internal control mechanisms are also deficient. Although NGOs or partners may also delegate tasks here, they themselves bear the responsibility for how these funds are managed. It is therefore important that there are appropriate internal control mechanisms for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a strong variation in support costs for similar projects. Perhaps a uniform benchmark ought to be set for projects of a particular type, to rule out this being due to ineffectiveness or inefficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is undoubtedly important that we continue to focus in future on sustainability and prevention. In the case of disaster preparedness, for example, early warning systems should be built up. In addition, we need to improve the transition phase between humanitarian aid and development aid. Finally, it is also important that the resilience of the local population is strengthened by building up local structures.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report was adopted with a large majority in committee, and naturally I would be very pleased to see a majority in favour of this report today in plenary.</p>

    <intervention id="4-124-000" speaker_id="2278" name="Paul Rübig" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we have a report which shows that the European Union has shouldered a great responsibility in the world. The aid measures that we provide should indeed be sustainable and, in this respect, we should aim, above all, for our aid measures to actually provide the population with a return on the investment. That is why the new development strategy also involves looking at how we can make energy available to the poorest of the poor regions, because in the final event, access to energy is crucial for the training and education required by the population, and because communication is the basis of a successful strategy, and we therefore need to look at how we shape our world’s resources sustainably. The report has a good approach to this: that we need better checks and balances in this area, and that actually, we should work on finding a model for this that enables us to provide aid as efficiently as possible in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in view of the increase in the number, frequency, scope and severity of humanitarian disasters, affecting several parts of the world, I welcome the Commission’s initiative which provides for an increase in the humanitarian aid instrument budget as part of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, at an annual average of around EUR 915 million. Another measure being proposed is to increase the Emergency Aid Reserve to EUR 2.5 billion for the same period, as well as the proposal for unspent funds in the reserve to be carried over to the following year. I think that the EU budget must support actions designed to anticipate disasters, avert them and react quickly to them, making it easier to initiate actions for emerging from crisis situations. We call for special care to be given to children, as well as to pregnant women and mothers of young children, with regard to the provision of food, clothing, evacuation and transportation, and the necessary health care services.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like to emphasise that one of the preconditions for ensuring the effective and useful administration of financial resources, and for ensuring the efficient provision of humanitarian and development aid, is an overall assessment of the needs created by a specific crisis in a given region.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There is still much room for improvement in this area, as can be seen from the situation in the Horn of Africa, where there has been no visible progress, despite the extensive humanitarian aid. Significant resources are nonetheless still being poured into this region, although there is uncertainty over who are the real beneficiaries. There are no processes or criteria available for identifying the final beneficiaries, on the basis of which it would be possible to define in a more concrete way the volume of resources that could be effectively provided, whether within the framework of humanitarian or development aid. I therefore consider it important that the European Parliament report is devoted to an actual audit of the provision of this aid as a whole, as well as an audit of cooperation with other organisations providing aid, including the UN.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-127-000" speaker_id="96654" name="Jaroslav Paška" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the EU humanitarian aid programmes for victims of various disasters or protracted conflicts are an integral part of EU policy. The Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, which is responsible for carrying out this activity on behalf of the European Union, works with more than two hundred partner organisations with different structures. On the basis of framework agreements, considerable funds are thus provided to the partner organisations for helping the victims of various disasters. The control mechanisms for the meaningful and effective use of funds by these organisations must therefore be an important aspect of the work of our administration.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Commission’s proposal to improve the supervision processes of the effective management of European taxpayers’ funds for humanitarian aid should therefore be seen as an effort to eliminate the deficiencies of the current model of control in order to achieve a more efficient use of these EU funds in the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, according to the statistics for recent decades, natural disasters are occurring more frequently across the globe. At the same time, the EU budget earmarked for humanitarian aid and civil protection is constantly growing. In this regard, good financial management is vital because the EU needs to have a more realistic humanitarian fund. I should emphasise the need to maintain the balance between financing actions designed to anticipate disasters and emergency aid. Europe must have formal mechanisms to prevent any abuses in this area. Transparent cooperation with international organisations is important. At the same time, the EU must ensure consistency between humanitarian aid and development aid; otherwise, it could have an adverse impact on local markets. For example, surplus food aid may discourage local food production.</p>

    <intervention id="4-129-000" speaker_id="96755" name="Sergio Paolo Francesco Silvestris" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that everything that has come out of this debate might merit the Commission’s particular attention: the need to appraise the humanitarian fund, the need for the EU to strengthen this commitment and the need – as Ms Băsescu so opportunely mentioned just now – to separate the fund for financing measures to prevent humanitarian disasters from the emergency aid reserve.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I would like to emphasise the need, the cogent need, to ensure more transparent mechanisms for the management of funds. A few weeks ago, I submitted an oral question regarding a case which had arisen, and which appeared in all the newspapers in Italy, concerning an unemployed youth who was involved with an NGO in asking for money without a contract, without any form of coordination with this NGO. For some unemployed people, operating as go-betweens in procuring aid for non-governmental organisations becomes almost a recreational club activity. We need to ensure mechanisms for transparency in managing the fund and in the operation of these mechanisms and activities.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-131-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kristalina Georgieva" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start by expressing my gratitude and the gratitude of the Commission particularly to the humanitarian staff, here in Brussels and in more than 40 countries, striving to deal with the humanitarian consequences of natural disasters and conflicts, often working in difficult and risky environments. We recognise that they do a good job in managing our taxpayers’ money and this is something that we very much appreciate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We live in a time when disasters are on the increase, conflicts are getting more complex and, while humanitarian needs are growing, resources are not. That puts additional pressure on how we use our taxpayers’ money, on the effectiveness and efficiency of our work, and, in this context, I am very grateful to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the advice you are giving us. Let me stress four points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the report comes at a very good time for us because we are working on the revision of our framework partnership agreements. In these revisions, we will continue to strive for strong control and monitoring systems for the effectiveness and speed of our operations, because for us, speed is not a luxury but translates into more lives saved at a lower cost for our taxpayers. Of course, in this context, we pay particular attention to the UN. It is right to say that we have to continue to work for the reform of the UN system and to negotiate for the internal audit reports of our UN partners to be made available to us. Let me emphasise that we have taken a very prudent approach to checking the performance of our partners and their projects. Every year, we review one third of our partners and one third of our projects to see whether they meet the high standards we have set for their performance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we strongly emphasise a results-oriented approach in our partnership agreements and we will continue to so. Yes, last year, we spent EUR 1.1 billion to help the victims of conflict and disasters around the world. With this money, we reached 146 million victims, providing them with food and water, medical care and shelter, and by doing so have reduced the risk of conflicts spreading further and creating more instability around the world. We want our partners to pay close attention to results and to value for money for our taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, I could not embrace more warmly the recommendation made to emphasise disaster risk reduction and link relief to rehabilitation and development. This is the only way we can cut the humanitarian cost in the future. Already, we have spent 8% to 10% of humanitarian aid on disaster risk reduction. We have made linking relief to rehabilitation and development a priority for our cooperation with Commissioner Piebalgs because the best way to build resilience is through development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we are committed to integrating into our work a systematic cost-benefit analysis so we can put forward projects and programmes that meet the requirement of achieving the highest possible result for European taxpayers’ money, so you can be sure that you have a partner on our side who is very mindful of what Europeans are doing in this time of austerity to help others in need around the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Since those perpetrating violence in war zones ignore fundamental humanitarian rules laid down in international law, humanitarian aid can all too easily become a pawn between the warring parties. The accusation that, if they become a regular source of income for warring parties, aid deliveries allow wars to be continued – in other words, that they feed the very suffering that causes humanitarian aid to become necessary – has to be taken seriously. The payment of tolls to local warlords in order to be allowed access to the needy population, for example, is a rotten compromise. It can also be problematic if refugee camps indirectly advance ethnic cleansing or become a target for military attacks. Aid organisations become questionable if they scarcely coordinate with each other, merely so that each organisation can gain donors’ funds for itself and have exclusive media coverage in its area of operations. Better coordination of humanitarian operations could have prevented a great deal of suffering in Haiti. Moreover, we need to find practical methods for the transition from humanitarian aid to development aid. When there are scandals such as funds trickling away, blatant abuses of power or ‘jobs for the boys’, we must stop blaming these on so-called black sheep or individual workers. Instead, we must nip them in the bud, for corruption spreads wherever there is little risk of discovery and punishment. It is time for the EU, as the largest humanitarian donor, to deal with these problems once and for all.</p>

      <p sl="el">Our role and duty as the European Parliament is to maintain the principle of sound budgetary management of financial assistance granted by the EU, via the Community budget, from European taxpayers’ money. The need to abide by this principle should apply equally to aid granted to the Member States of the Union and to third countries, especially those facing the whole spectrum of humanitarian crisis. This being so, I support the call on the European Commission to further improve the efficacy and effectiveness of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system. As far as efficacy and effectiveness during the implementation of humanitarian aid managed by ECHO are concerned, I endorse the recommendations formulated in the report that the Commission should continue in its efforts to create a better coordinated and more coherent needs assessment system. Finally, I agree that the European Parliament should have access to the final audit reports of ECHO partners on the implementation of humanitarian actions. It is only with transparency and accountability that we can ensure that the money from the Community budget is spent correctly and effectively.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the report on the EU’s foreign policy towards Brazil, Russia, India and China (the BRICS), and other emerging powers including Turkey, Indonesia and Mexico, rightly acknowledges the increasing role these countries play in our foreign policy and the increasing contribution they are making to the global economy. We have also seen an increased participation in cooperation in the policies of the BRICS and the emerging powers on an international level, and this is to be encouraged at all times.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can now see the development of a multipolar system where economic and political power is distributed between a number of blocs. It is for this reason that I support the report’s proposal for the development of a coherent EU approach, to treat the BRICS as a single bloc, and to also seek to establish partnerships with each of the countries within the bloc, which will prove to be invaluable when responding to global challenges such as climate change, terrorism and, of course, the financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I took part in a debate in the United Kingdom last month against our former Europe Minister about these BRICs. He said: ‘What you have to understand, Hannan, people like you, is that we sell more to the Netherlands than we sell to the whole of Brazil. We sell more to Belgium than we sell to the whole of China’. I replied, ‘That is precisely the problem’. Which is the better long-term prospect?</p>
      <p sl="en">When we joined the European Union in 1973, we had the impression that we were hitching our wagons to a powerful locomotive. Western Europe had indeed grown spectacularly in the years following 1945. It had far outperformed the United Kingdom, burdened as it was with the enormous debt-to-GDP ratio that it had at the end of the Second World War.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we can now see in retrospect that our timing could hardly have been worse. In relative terms, Western Europe stopped growing in the oil crisis of 1974 and never really got going again. We foolishly stood aside from the parts of the world which are still developing, where the growth still is, not least the Anglosphere and Commonwealth markets to which we are tied by habit, blood and speech. We are cabined, cribbed, confined in a dwindling customs union. We should raise our eyes to the broader, brighter and more distant horizons that our fathers took for granted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I was opposed to a report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on BRICS on the basis that there was little politically in common between these rising powers other than their self-evident vast and growing economic and military strengths.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support good relations with the countries individually but I am under no illusion that China remains a one-party dictatorship, Russia has an authoritarian government which openly tolerates high-level corruption, whereas India and Brazil are liberal democracies with the same fundamental values, legal checks and balances and freedoms as EU Member States. My group is particularly keen on advocating stronger trade links through deep and comprehensive free trade agreements with both India and Brazil – the latter ideally through Mercosur, as Latin America enjoys the same growth rate of about 8% as China, and has a collective economy roughly the same size as China’s, but is totally different by sharing our common democratic values.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is a space for closer cooperation between the EU and the BRICS countries. This is especially relevant at a time when BRICS countries are showing their clear ambitions in foreign policy terms. From this point of view, it will be important to bring the emerging economic powers to take a different role in international development policy. In my opinion, this role should better reflect their share in the global GDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Changes in the world economic landscape and in the new role played by countries like China, India and Brazil give the opportunity for strengthening global development policies. The rising economic strength of these countries means taking up more responsibilities in opening up their markets to the least developed countries, for example, through preferential schemes, but also on a non-discriminatory basis towards the rest of the WTO membership.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The need to reinforce these relations is well supported by the fact that the growth potential of these countries is becoming more and more influential on a global scale and, as a result, they are claiming an increasingly great role in shaping world politics. This rapid development influences the economic and political interests of the European Union and its Member States in every respect. The situation, naturally, has a direct impact on the economic and foreign and security policy of the EU, and in this regard, I am thinking primarily of Chinese investments.</p>

Of course they have all kinds of things in common economically. Having lived in a BRICS country and worked in a situation where you can get things done quickly without the chains and encumbrances of red tape, I can only say that economically, they are going to go places quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, politically, we have not shown here in the European Union that we have the sophistication in foreign policy terms to develop and deal with these very varying political states in a sensible and sophisticated way. That is what we should be concentrating on and, if we cannot do that, we should leave it to Member States who can.</p>

As Pink Floyd might have said, we should not treat them as another BRIC in the wall.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we should be looking at is the granularity, and the differences between individual countries. So, for example, Brazil offers great prospects for many companies across the EU. The same goes for Russia, but the problem is, as Kasparov said, when it comes to elections, you already know the result, but you do not know what the outcome might be. India is the world’s largest democracy, with over a billion people and the rule of law, but not actually enough economic liberalisation. And when we look at China, there has been the economic liberalisation but not enough freedom and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these things can only be enhanced with greater trade from the EU, but it is time that we started to try to match the growth of the BRICS countries rather than bring in policies such as the financial transaction tax, which would actually reduce growth in the EU in these difficult times.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report puts forward what seem to be balanced recommendations to the Council for when the EU needs to place sanctions on these regimes. It is important, however, that the EU should develop clearer definitions of what sanctions criteria are, which should also be in line with the EU’s strategy on human rights. It is equally necessary to gain support for the EU sanctions policy from all of our international partners when they have been applied to third countries, which would only strengthen the impact of the policy globally. Clearly, the use of sanctions needs to be coupled with diplomacy, which is often the preferred method of responding to authoritarian regimes by the majority of our Member States and should be respected as the preferred collective tool.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, people often do not realise the extent to which the European Union aggressively exports its ideology. Just as the US did after the Second World War, and just as the Soviet Union did during the revolutionary period, so the European Union attempts to encourage other parts of the world to form regional blocs in mimicry of its own structures. It does not just make its aid dependent on reproductive rights and so on, but it very often – and far more damagingly – requires countries to be part of whatever regional bloc is nearby. It makes clear that it will not sign trade or aid deals with individual sovereign states but will only deal bloc to bloc.</p>
      <p sl="en">People often do not realise the extent to which organisations like Mercosur, the Central American Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Union, are not just bodies encouraged by the European Union, but were really creatures of the EU, sponsored by the Commission and largely dependent on it for their financing. This creates a beautifully circular argument for European federalists who say, ‘We have to be part of this big bloc because that is what the rest of the world is doing’, when, of course, they are obliging the rest of the world to do so. In reality, it is the little countries that are doing well. The wealthiest countries of the world are the Monacos and the UAEs. In the top ten, only one state has a population of 7 million. It is by being this large, elephantine presence that we have made ourselves poorer and less relevant.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, targeted sanctions are an essential soft power economic mechanism against misbehaving states that the EU can deploy to enforce the combined political will of its Member States. Most recently, the measures agreed by the EU in denying Iran some of its oil revenues are making it harder for the leadership to move money around the world, as a result of its non-cooperation with mandates and orders from the IAEA and the UN to conform with its international obligations over its nuclear programme, and this will now put much more pressure on Tehran to come back to the negotiating table.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore welcome the Watson report and especially its recommendations for developing a consistent and coherent sanctions policy in the Council of Ministers, and its emphasis on the importance of acquiring wider international support such as the UN for EU sanctions to give them even further punch and effect in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I, too, voted in favour of the Watson report. In his report, the rapporteur describes the general way in which the European Union behaves towards regimes. He states that all EU activities and economic and political relations are based on our values and standards and that human rights should be considered in every dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the European Union should speak with one voice in order to achieve even greater efficiency in restrictive measures, something I believe to be particularly important.</p>
      <p sl="de">So far, so good – I might say. What constantly disturbs me, however, is the fact that when specific changes occur in such regimes, when revolution breaks out, when people try to take their human rights into their own hands, then it seems to me that the European Union is never sufficiently prepared. I would therefore simply ask that we should work together – together with the Commission – in a strategic way, so that we have a better idea what is going on in these countries, enabling us to apply sanctions exactly where they will have an effect.</p>

      <p sl="en">I strongly believe that cross-border company migration is a fundamental part of ensuring the completion of the internal market and will enable us to adapt to a more coherent EU-wide policy on these procedures. It is going to be welcomed by businesses across the EU and it is particularly pertinent when one of the main complaints I hear from businesses is that they are prevented from migrating to other parts of the EU, given the existence of high administrative burdens in some areas that they would prefer to avoid. It is for these reasons that I am happy to support this report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The reinforcement of the single market is in our common interest, as all Member States have a stake in the European Union’s truly becoming a free area without restrictions. By extending the interpretation of the freedom of establishment to enterprises, the investments and economic establishments of the Hungarian economy will, as part of the internal market, also benefit from full protection and security. It is the so far very successful dismantling of barriers that is the source of the global competitiveness of the EU and its individual Member States.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on this report and I would like to make a couple of points to support my vote in that regard. In that opinion, we try to emphasise that Articles 49 and 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guarantee freedom of establishment for all companies and firms, ensuring that there are no barriers. Cross-border company migration is one of the crucial elements in the completion of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is a real lack of consistency in legislation on transfers and on procedures for transferring registered offices, real head offices, existing companies or firms incorporated under national law from one Member State to another. We need to eliminate these problems. But in doing so, we must ensure that any legislation prevents abuses such as the setting up of mailbox companies and protects the interests and guarantees the existing rights of creditors and employees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the report on the budgetary control of EU humanitarian aid takes on board the criticisms of the European Court of Auditors in that it recognises the instances in which accountability and transparency of the monitoring systems and internal audit procedures could be significantly improved. It also looks at how EU funds are used and managed by partner organisations such as the NGOs and UN agencies, and places greater emphasis on measuring results against initial indicators when the evaluations are taking place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also proposes various improvements that could be made to the framework partnership agreements, notably with the process of selecting partners to try to ensure that we achieve best value for money in addition to gaining the experience and expertise that they can offer. For me, this is an important justification as my constituents back home in Wales are continuously questioning the value gained by UK contributions to the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in the European Parliament in Strasbourg recently, I met a very clever man from Nigeria called Thompson Ayodele. He talked me through a number of statistics on foreign aid, and the figures were pitilessly clear. He showed that international assistance was not useless; it was actively harmful. If you compared countries in receipt of it with countries not in receipt of it over the same periods, the countries not in receipt grew faster, were more democratic, developed more impressively, and for the obvious reason: foreign aid breaks the link between taxation, representation and expenditure. It allows governments to remain in office without the support of their populations.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are lots of things we could be doing to help developing countries. We could open our markets; we could abolish the common agricultural policy; we could encourage their exporters to sell. But the one thing that is absolutely not going to help is giving this kind of assistance, especially when we do not have the money. This is the crazy thing! We are borrowing money we do not have in order to give it to countries whose situation would thereby be worsened, all in order to make ourselves feel virtuous.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are also keen to see more involvement of the beneficiaries of the aid in the process of aid planning and management, in an attempt to prevent the negative effects of humanitarian aid that can occur without careful monitoring by all the parties, for example, the discouragement of local food production by the supply of surplus food aid coming from an unreformed CAP of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that there must be more conditionality, as well as accountability, with regard to the results, and that more careful monitoring must be put in place to measure the output of humanitarian aid against pre-set indicators. For example, there should be no aid whatsoever for a BRIC country like India or China.</p>

I can understand this. It is the duty of the European Union to help people in need. Nonetheless, we must be equally clear on the other side: when assistance is given, we need to know what it is being given for and it must be easy to check whether the aid reaches its intended destination, rather than ending up in the coffers of some corrupt governments, never to be heard of again. Although this is self-evident, we nonetheless need to demand this on a daily basis. Naturally, this also means looking to ensure that the aid is genuinely efficient. We need to check that the aid really gets to where it is needed and that it is efficient. If we can manage these two things, then we shall make a lot more progress. Transparency is a minimum requirement in all of this. For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report.</p>

One of the greatest problems I have found in talking to people on the ground is the lack of continuity. By the time they get a programme into existence, the European Union changes its mind and goes on and creates another programme which they have to go through all the bureaucracy and red tape to qualify for again.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have got to get it right. I think it has the chance and it can deliver and do good. But there is too much bureaucracy, there is too much red tape, there is too much control, and people are not allowed to get on with doing the work themselves on the ground. I personally had a recent experience in Uganda where I went out with a local faith-based organisation who are drilling one new well every week, bringing water to miles around and doing a fantastic job. Those are the type of things we should be doing, when you see the disease and the way in which disease is being reduced in children, allowing them to live and giving them life.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, today we are debating a report concerning the budgetary control of humanitarian aid. It is a very disturbing report.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, we have the role of the United Nations. The report contends that the control of EU funds awarded to the UN is absolutely terrible. Reports to the EU are vague and late. The Court of Auditors is obstructed when it comes to accessing information about projects carried out and there is a lack of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness when it comes to the management of resources. Reforms that had been required in the past have simply not been implemented.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Next, we have cost efficiency when it comes to aid in general. From my own investigations, I know that fraud does take place in EU development projects. Thanks to OLAF and the Court of Auditors, cases are brought to light. I am focused on the fact that much more needs to be done and I will fight hard, on behalf of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), to ensure that that happens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is unconscionable that, despite all these serious cases, it is still being proposed that the development budget should be increased. We will therefore definitely be voting against this report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Since the use of these funds is managed and directed by the Commission’s Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO), I also welcome the rapporteur’s proposals for the improvement of the efficiency of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system.

Obviously, as welfare societies, we Europeans want to support undeveloped countries, so that people there can lead a happy and full life. It is very important, however, to ensure that, when, as Europeans, we act, we implement projects which reflect European Union values and which are, in that way, ethically sustainable. Above all, we need to export democracy, human rights and freedom of expression, and make sure that Europe’s heritage of values and intellectual input are strongly present. That is why it is good to be having this debate.</p>

Iran is a country in which no democratic standards of any kind are upheld, a country where all the values in which we in the European Union believe are persecuted or where such values are simply not found. It is a regime which is very oppressive towards its own people. We all remember the events of not long ago on the streets of Tehran. In the hands of such people, a nuclear weapon, and the Iranian nuclear programme, which will, without doubt, lead to the construction of a nuclear weapon, are extremely dangerous things.</p>

I also want to appeal yet again in this Chamber for the European Union to show solidarity with our greatest ally in the Middle East, and to do so, too, as part of this discussion about the Iranian nuclear programme.

It sponsors militias and terrorist organisations in Central Asia, in the Balkans; it struck even as far afield as London and Buenos Aires.</p>

As an avid rugby supporter, I cannot help but see this as a missed opportunity for the Parliament. The report should have focused on the positive contribution that sports can have on both participants and supporters in terms of instilling values of respect, fair play and social inclusion, and should have focused on how the EU could help the development of grassroot sports. It instead concentrates on how the EU can take advantage of the increasing popularity of professional sport, including how to develop a database to share information on hooligans, which effectively duplicates the work already being conducted by Europol. The report proposes that all agents representing European sportsmen have their fiscal residence in the EU. This clearly does not serve to promote sport across the EU and certainly not globally.</p>

      <p sl="en">Instead of, for instance, creating a new EU database of football hooligans, which is already a Europol competence, we should focus on national authorities developing sports facilities at the more local level, with the aim that hooliganism can be diminished thanks to greater Community involvement and the ability to get along with others or work as part of team. We should focus on skills; participation in sport has been proven to be a way of teaching these skills. We should be giving more people the chance to learn a sense of discipline and self-worth rather than focusing exclusively on introducing new EU legal rules on fiscal residence for sports agents, as the report seems to suggest.</p>

These also represent genuine manifestations of history and culture which we should develop and encourage, especially among the young.</p>

These constituent nations of the United Kingdom compete in international competitions with their own teams.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have several reservations relating to the proposals in this report. One such proposal sought to politicise sport by having the EU flag flown at all major sports events in the EU. Another proposal sought to politicise our sporting athletes by making them have an EU logo on their clothing. I cannot support those proposals, because I do not believe you should politicise sport.</p>
      <p sl="en">I certainly do believe we should encourage sports participation in schools, increase the awareness of social responsibilities in sports stadiums, highlight the importance of volunteers in sport, increase the attention to the needs of disabled sports people. I call for sport to benefit from EU Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">But in my 22 and a half years here, I have never witnessed such a spectacle as I did today, when the President of this Parliament shamefully took his actions. I do not agree with Mr Hannan, because the President of this Parliament is well advised by the people to his left and to his right.

      <p sl="fi">This is a first step, and I am therefore slightly disappointed that the friends of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group there on the right see only a threat and not opportunities. Perhaps you might reconsider this for a moment: this will provide great opportunities for taking sport forward, improving public health, increasing well-being at European Union level, and more.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Trivial matters like the flag, whether or not it is on the inside or outside of the team shirt (which is completely optional), or whether the EU flag should or should not be raised at a particular sporting event, are neither here nor there. Moreover, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland can play under their own flags, and no one will say anything about it. On the contrary, the aim is for civic commitment on the part of Europeans at grassroots level: for people for whom sport is important. We are also trying get people involved in building their own nation, as a priority, but it is also seen as a common benefit in the European internal market if we have healthy employees.</p>

Surely it is important that we allow supporters to decide that they can support their own country?</p>

As my old school song used to say, it is all about tasting the sweet of victory and the salt of defeat. At the European level, there have been moves towards more fair play. UEFA, the football organisation, has a UEFA fair play award.</p>

      <p sl="it">There are too many citizens who even now, in 2012, are paying for the consequences of poor waste management in terms of their daily lives and their health, incinerators and landfills being cases in point. All the same, virtuous examples of ecologically sustainable waste management in the EU do exist. We must therefore do all we can to reach a point of total recycling, where waste actually becomes a genuine resource.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is already a reality today. There are treatment plants that recycle nearly 100% of urban waste, as in the case of the Vedelago waste centre in the province of Treviso, whose technology is exported throughout Europe. Nevertheless, we need more controls, prevention and, above all, responsible choices. We should recycle, recover and reduce waste and say ‘no’ to huge incinerators and landfills that are often the cause of air and aquifer pollution.</p>

I should point out that the new Member States are at the bottom of the league when it comes to recycling, even though the volume of waste they produce is below the European average. Romania is among the countries targeted by petitions about waste management. In order to meet EU standards, my country is currently implementing the integrated waste management system.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I voted in favour of the report due to the enormous need for diversification of energy sources in Europe. Until recently, the construction of the Northern Gas Pipeline – from Russia to Germany – was intended to be the panacea for all energy shortages. The pipeline was supposed to secure a steady delivery of natural gas to the European Union. As recently as yesterday, the Russian company, Gazprom, reduced gas delivery to a number of European Union states. According to the company, the decision resulted from the increase in demand for natural gas in Russia, which occurred as a consequence of the freezing conditions. A few years ago, political point scoring in Russia led to other countries suffering from a shortage of natural gas. This illustrates the importance of the pursuit of new energy sources within the European Union, both in the context of the European Union’s security as well as in terms of the protection of all types of EU activity. It is, of course, not possible for the EU to attain self-sufficiency in this area, but it is necessary to use all possible means to achieve security. Thank you very much.</p>

EU competition policy is one area where I can be truly enthusiastic. It has provided that essential tool, eliminating the obstacles that Mr Tannock spoke about. I am particularly keen to see that the rapporteur has recognised the need to update rules. Constant update to processes is vitally important to maintain consumer confidence in what we are doing.</p>

It is in the EU’s interest to promote coordination with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and other emerging powers, owing to the growing global importance of these countries in various areas. Just as there is already continuous coordination between them, the EU should, for example, promote harmonious positions for meetings such as the United Nations General Assembly or strategic partnerships in other areas, provided that this does not jeopardise the interests of the EU Member States and their citizens. As such, it is appropriate to build these diplomatic efforts through an institutional mechanism, perhaps through the European External Action Service, which can deal with these countries in a consistent and even way.</p>

I agree with the rapporteur that the overall coordination of EU foreign policy towards the BRICS and other emerging powers should be ensured by the Commission, that better linking of foreign and security policy with EU sectoral policies should be implemented by the following actions: increasing the participation of the EP in bilateral summits between the EU and its strategic partners, increasing the role of the BRICS in international development policy that better reflects their share in global GDP, strengthening the strategic dialogue between EU and USA on global governance and reform of international organisations. We, Members of European Parliament, conclude that the EU should take into account the new weight in political and economic terms of the BRICS and other emerging powers and use its political leverage to continue promoting universal values in the looming new multipolar system of global governance and be at the forefront of the process of reform of the international governance system.</p>

In addition to that, there will be also the potential risk of political and economic fragmentation, and of competing world agendas.

I voted in favour of this text because it will allow us to go beyond cooperation in purely economic terms and to strive for the creation of a common foreign policy platform. These countries want us, the western powers, to include them more with a view to strengthening global governance and multilateral diplomacy. Let us not forget that the BRICS countries are already showing clear ambitions in foreign policy terms, as they have held regular meetings since 2009 and are seeking to establish common positions. For the time being, they are doing this without us. It is therefore imperative that we take into account the new economic and political weight of the BRICS countries. As the rapporteur emphasises, ‘this proves all the more necessary, considering that transnational challenges – such as climate change, global regulatory issues, access to raw materials and rare earths, terrorism, sustainable development,’ etc. – will require an inclusive approach based on common values.

Ever increasing demographic imbalances between Western countries and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and other emerging powers in the near future threaten to change the hitherto established relationship of influence in the international arena and the system of global governance itself. In 2050, seven emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) are projected to have larger economies than all the Group of Seven (G7) countries (USA, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy) put together. China is projected to become the world’s largest economy by 2020, while India could become the fastest growing economy in the world by 2050. These countries will become increasingly important internationally, particularly for tackling global issues such as combating climate change, international terrorism, the distribution of resources and rare minerals, political stability worldwide, etc. Therefore, the EU must enhance cooperation with the BRICS and other emerging powers in the system of global governance and in international organisations. I agree that we need to consider at EU level how to maximise the role, voice and voting power of the EU in international fora and achieve more streamlined coordination and a more cohesive stance among EU Member States in such fora.</p>

Faced, for example, with the prediction that China will soon become the world’s largest economy, Brussels must increase its efforts to influence the emerging multipolar system of global governance effectively. One of the objectives of the Union’s foreign policy is the adoption of a coherent approach towards these countries when viewed as a potential bloc, and the widening of cooperation and strategic partnerships with each of these countries individually, especially with those that are democratic, for such a partnership will constitute an ideal tool with real potential for introducing change. In an increasingly coherent manner, the BRICS countries are also deciding the political direction of prominent international organisations, such as the United Nations. Moreover, taking into account the economic as well as the demographic potential of these countries, only a coordinated European policy can contribute to the increased role and effectiveness of the Union on the international arena.

According to current data, it is projected that the economic growth of the BRICS will only increase in future, and that by 2050, their economic growth will exceed that of all the G7 countries (USA, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy) put together. In future, through its foreign policy, the European Union must therefore carefully take into account the new economic and political power of these emerging economies and act as a single and robust political and economic entity.

In a global economic perspective, in terms of gross domestic product, China is projected to become the world’s largest economy before 2020 and India could become the country with the fastest growing economy before 2050, whereas the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), together with Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, will have larger economies than, collectively, the G7 countries. Should the economic growth of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the emerging economies be further consolidated, these countries will acquire strong relevance in foreign policy terms on the global scene. However, considering the interdependence between the world’s economies, the consolidation of the economic leadership of the emerging economies will be conditional on the welfare of the emerged economies. All this provides a big opportunity for the EU: taking into account the new weight, in political terms, of the BRICS, it will be able to use its political leverage to continue to promote universal values in the looming new multipolar system of global governance and be at the forefront of the process of reform of the international governance system.

I support the G20 parliamentary dimension and I believe that it should be further consolidated and involved in decision-making processes, in order to ensure reinforced democratic dialogue and greater scrutiny. I firmly believe that the current sovereign debt crisis will be an important test for the G20 as an effective forum for strategic political dialogue, creating foundations for the elimination of systemic unbalances which can be particularly damaging both for developed economies and, in a longer-term perspective, emerging ones, and promoting solidarity in international financial fora such as the International Monetary Fund.

I prefer the distinction between the CIVETS countries (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Turkey and South Africa) and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to designate the main emerging global economies because I believe that this ‘separation’ between the two emerging economic groups brings greater precision to the strategic analysis of their relations with the EU. However, I believe that this report proposes a set of rather important measures for the future of our relations with the BRICS, to use the name that includes South Africa, which should obviously be considered by the EU. Multilateralism should be given the greatest importance in international relations, but the BRICS should also be more involved in economic development policy at global level, and the role of Parliament should be strengthened in relations with these countries.

The BRICS do not constitute a homogeneous bloc since they are situated in different geographic areas, have different histories and have not adopted EU values to the same extent. However, they make up 40% of the world’s population, represent 17% of the global gross domestic product and often take positions that are harmonised with one another. Without giving up its principles and values, the EU cannot distance itself from the increasingly important role of these emerging economies, and should work together with them towards addressing the issues affecting our planet, including climate change, terrorism, sustainable development, access to raw materials, political stability and global security.

      <p sl="pt">Recognising the growing importance of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in the global economy, this report states that the EU needs to strengthen relations with each of these countries. The concern being expressed is, however, that they should be considered separately. There are a number of reasons for this. The growth and diversification of the BRIC countries’ economic activity jeopardises the traditional division of global labour, which is unfavourable to these countries. Their role is not limited to producing items low in value added and exporting raw materials and agricultural produce for countries at the heart of the capitalist system. Today, they are increasingly becoming world powers to rival the triad: the US, Japan and the EU. Some of them are even pursuing the opposite path to the EU in the fight against hunger and poverty. We should not forget that in a few years, millions of people have been pulled out of extreme poverty in China, India and Brazil, in a process that has not been without major contradictions. It is a fact that, internationally, the BRIC countries have been coming together on a number of important issues. The positions taken up by the BRIC countries in the international arena and their working together are increasingly being seen as a threat to the influence and dominance of the aforementioned triad, especially in the institutions of international capitalism: the World Bank, the IMF and the G20.</p>

      <p sl="en">This week, the Parliament has been discussing the EU's relations towards the BRICS and other emerging powers. Good relations with countries like Brazil are vital, especially in terms of encouraging trade. One key area of interest to me is the trade of agricultural products. We import large amounts of meat from Brazil; meat that comes from animals that do not have to comply with the same rigorous standards and regulation that our farmers are subjected to. One example is the introduction of yet another pointless and costly regulation to electronically identify all sheep within the EU. These new rules to monitor the movement of sheep are flawed. They require a 100% accuracy rate of recording to be achieved by farmers, a task which is impossible because the available technology is not 100% reliable. If our farmers fail to achieve a 100% accuracy rate, they face heavy financial penalties. This is completely unacceptable. I therefore urge the Commission to review this regulation to allow some discretion to reflect the reality of the unreliable EID technology.</p>

With this in mind, we are proposing to give a few more powers to these emerging countries in the UN and the IMF, since we are begging them for a bail-out in the euro crisis. It would also mean exclusively entrusting relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to the European Union, so, for the moment, to Baroness Ashton, while national diplomacies would be mere relays with no autonomy from the decisions taken in Brussels.

Instead of abating, the recession is deepening, unemployment is growing, and the lack of innovation and new investment in Europe do not suggest that the situation will improve. As it falls into a state of apathy, Europe is no longer a model to emulate, in contrast to the accelerating economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS group of countries), which are relatively unaffected by the global recession. According to economic forecasts, the economies of these countries are predicted to accelerate even further. In addition, these countries are strengthening politically and developing common positions – which are often controversial for Europe – in relation to global conflicts and problems.</p>

We need to learn from China, from Brazil, from South Africa, from India, from Turkey, and from others. We need to give them, and others too, their rightful place in the reform of the international institutions. Tackling the major global challenges will require multipolar, global cooperation. Europe will not be able to convince the rest of the world unless it has a project that is supported across the political spectrum, from left to right. Europe can set the tone if it leaves behind its sovereignists, if it speaks with one voice.</p>

It is therefore very important that we should improve and develop economic relations with the aforementioned countries in particular. Nonetheless, the EU should not be influenced too much by the ideas and initiatives of the United States. I fear that this proposal will strengthen the dominant position of the US, which could, in turn, lead to stagnation in the development of trade with the BRIC countries. The EU must develop its own initiatives and must not allow itself to be intimidated too much by its big neighbour on the other side of the Atlantic.

I believe that this proposal does not make sense in light of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, it concerns two quite different policies, subject to very different systems under the EU Treaties. Secondly, under the Treaty, the High Representative only has the jurisdiction to steer foreign and security policy, and not to ‘coordinate’ the various EU external action policies, in particular, foreign trade policy. Thirdly, where there is a need for such ‘coordination’, this falls to the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Trade together, without this meaning that one has any authority over the other, or that there is any hierarchy. This proposal will therefore mean an unacceptable change to the balance and distribution of powers between the institutions and bodies of the EU.</p>

The aforementioned growing economic powers have already proven that they foster high ambitions in terms of foreign policy, and it is likely that they will gradually take over leadership in the shaping of global governance and strategies of global significance. This shows how important it is to increase internal cohesion within the EU and to strengthen our common foreign policy. Only by acting as a single robust entity will we be able to compete with the growing economic and political powers and maintain relevance in the new, multipolar system of global governance and leadership. The emerging new global balance of forces creates an opportunity for the European Union to take initiative and assume leadership in the process of changing and reforming the system of global governance, which will include the new powers.

      <p sl="pt">The European Union and its banking institutions are often chosen by leaders of developing countries, where democracy is taking a long time to gain a foothold, for depositing large sums of money. For instance, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has between USD 50 million and USD 70 million invested in the EU and the US, the Gaddafi regime of Libya holds billions of US dollars in assets in the EU, and Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has USD 4 billion invested in the EU. The report drafted by Mr Watson concerns the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on how to implement a consistent policy on regimes against which the EU applies restrictive measures when their leaders exercise their personal and commercial interests within EU borders. I voted for this report, as those who lead authoritarian regimes and enrich themselves through corruption and by exploiting the people and resources of their countries must be forced to respect human dignity. They cannot act with complete freedom and impunity in the face of the impotence and, often, the complacency of international institutions. The EU should set an example by confiscating these assets and returning them to the democratically elected governments.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Implementing the principles contained in this report conflicts with international law and the UN Charter of Human Rights. The latter advocates, inter alia , the development of ‘friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples’ and ‘international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character’. These are the principles which should govern international relations. This report sets out an approach based on intervention in the internal affairs of countries. Sanctions are one of the instruments of this approach. Moreover, the explicit encouragement of support for parties that are in conflict, with a view to regime change or to shifts in political power in certain countries, constitutes unacceptable interference, which invariably includes undisguised ambitions to satisfy economic and/or political interests. As we have already stated on several occasions, changes in the political power of a country should result from its people exercising their sovereign will, not from foreign impositions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Sanctions or restrictive measures are regarded as coercive measures short of force, such as arms embargoes, trade sanctions, financial and economic sanctions, freezing of assets, flight bans, restrictions on admission, diplomatic sanctions, boycotts of sports and cultural events and suspension of cooperation with a third country. The application of sanctions and restrictive measures is effective only if it forms part of a cohesive overarching EU and Member State strategy on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, the EU has often applied its sanctions policy inconsistently by treating third countries with similar human rights and democratic records differently, and such actions have prompted criticism for applying double standards. I therefore firmly believe that it is necessary to develop clear criteria for when restrictive measures are to be applied, the objectives for such measures, the form of sanctions to be applied, guidelines for their periodic evaluation and the review procedure to be followed in consultation with the European Parliament. We should establish the criteria in a way that enhances the consistency and credibility of EU sanctions, but leaves sufficient flexibility at the operational level, enabling the Union to leverage the instrument as an effective tool in its external action.</p>

It represents a unique opportunity for promoting human rights and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence of the community of Member States. Unfortunately, thus far, the cumbersome red tape surrounding the EU’s restrictive measures against regimes that do not respect international law, and the failure of such measures to feed into one another, have meant that they have not always had the desired effect as deterrents and sanctions. It is unjust that sometimes, peoples that are already oppressed or European companies and citizens should have suffered the consequences of sanctions, while the corrupt, violent local elites have managed to evade them. In the same way, it is equally unjust that third countries take and have taken advantage of European respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights.

A natural corollary of this is the need to reject authoritarian regimes which, instead of pursuing the common good of the people that they represent, are predisposed to satisfy the personal interests of the holders of posts in public bodies. In this context, it is appropriate that any measures adopted by the EU clearly identify which individuals are subject to sanctions, on the one hand, and when sanctions should be applied, on the other, so that measures adopted will be targeted at the subjects to be sanctioned, in order to prevent the people of the country from being affected, wherever possible. Any guidelines established should also be adopted by all of the Member States, in order to ensure an effective foreign policy. Moreover, and this is a key point in the report, they should take advantage of the possibility that a large proportion of the personal assets of leaders subjected to the sanctions will be within EU borders, opening the door to more effective action by the EU.

Imposing sanctions means getting rid of a space that could and should be used for dialogue, negotiation and diplomatic mediation. We do not accept acts of direct intervention and intrusion in the internal affairs of countries by supporting one of the sides in a conflict, which often goes hand-in-hand with sanctions. Recently, there have been several unfortunate cases in which foreign powers have directly interfered in political change in a country through various forms of support for one of the sides in a conflict, and it is obvious that this was not done in a ‘disinterested’ way. It is sovereign peoples that should decide their own destinies and futures, without being subjected to pressure and interference from foreign powers. The unilateral decision to apply sanctions takes this approach by failing to respect the sovereignty of peoples. Instead, what is needed is total compliance with international law, the United Nations Charter and the principles contained therein.</p>

There is obviously a key issue for consideration in these processes of transferring head offices of companies from one Member State to another: the need to involve employees in decisions on this matter and, to that end, to seek to improve their participation in the governing bodies of the companies. Consideration also needs to be given to the use of fiscal dumping as a way of attracting companies to other Member States.

Currently, there is a lack of consistency in legislation on procedures for transferring the registered office or real head office of an existing company from one Member State to another within the single market. The transfer of company seats is often accompanied by administrative difficulties, high costs, social implications and the lack of legal certainty. We, Members of the European Parliament, agree that the process within the EU should be harmonised, the directive should apply to limited liability companies and allow companies to exercise their right of establishment by migrating to a host Member State without losing their legal personality. The transfer should not circumvent legal, social and fiscal conditions. Any company against which proceedings for winding-up, liquidation, insolvency or suspension of payments or other similar proceedings have been brought should not be allowed to undertake a cross-border transfer of seat. This legal harmonisation will strengthen competitiveness at EU level.</p>

The European Parliament has exercised this right because, in its opinion, the Commission’s inaction on this issue is a mistake as it is failing to remedy obstacles preventing companies from exercising one of the fundamental rights granted to them by the EU – freedom of establishment throughout the European Union. This opinion of the European Parliament is based on the results of several public consultations, as well as the conclusions of the European Court of Justice, that too many disparities still remain in the national legislation of the Member States applicable to company establishment, preventing the exercising of the freedom of establishment, and a harmonised regime should therefore be established throughout the EU. The harmonisation of such a legal regime applicable to company establishment throughout the EU would facilitate the removal of many administrative obstacles and a reduction in the social and tax costs of establishing a company in another Member State.</p>

On the one hand, we want to prevent the transfer of company seats from resulting in the liquidation of a company in its home country and, on the other, we want to ensure that the employees are not the victims of this transfer and do not lose any of their social rights. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, my aim was to ensure that the transfer does not affect the rights of creditors, employees or shareholders. In my opinion, the social aspects of the transfer are crucial. We must ensure that the employees are involved in the company seat transfer process: they must be consulted, informed and, if necessary, have access to legal remedies, with suspensive effect. Employees should no longer be the victims of company seat transfers but should instead be able to benefit from them, regardless of whether the companies involved are large or small.

Provided that workers’ rights are safeguarded, it is vital that companies be able to transfer their registered office, as this will save time and money. However, legal uncertainties and bureaucracy, which differs from one Member State to the next, have been preventing its implementation.

Lastly, I am deeply concerned that the Commission did not allow the Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) access to the partners’ final reports on the implementation of humanitarian actions in Haiti and Pakistan in 2010 and I would like to receive an explanation.</p>

The text underlines the areas of weakness in control over the funds and proposes improvements to be made. We stress the importance of establishing a clear regulation with the scope to have a single integrated reporting model, which would simplify the complexity of the administrative procedures. In this regard, I also support the fact that ECHO is currently working on the development of a comparative cost information system in order to analyse the cost-effectiveness of project proposals.

It is important today for us to be more effective in order to tackle the growing number of major natural disasters. Martin Ehrenhauser’s report received broad support because it responded to all of these issues. We need both to restore the balance of the parts of the budget allocated to preventing humanitarian disasters and to retain adequate financial leeway to enable us to intervene rapidly if a crisis arises. The new financial framework provides for an increase in the budget for the humanitarian aid instrument, which will help us to anticipate disasters. In addition, the new financing arrangements will allow unspent funds in the reserve to be carried over to the following year for urgent humanitarian needs. Finally, we call for particular care for children, as well as expectant mothers and mothers of young children, with regard to the provision of food, clothing, evacuation and transportation, and medical facilities with a view to preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, as priority areas under the existing financial mechanisms.</p>

In 2010 alone, there were two huge catastrophes in Haiti and Pakistan, which demonstrated that a certain lack of effectiveness and coordination is hindering efficient disaster response. Furthermore, there is a need to ensure appropriate control and transparency as regards the use of EU funds, and to increase the accountability of beneficiaries, stopping the misuse of allocated funds. I believe that it is important to take account of the recommendation made by the European Court of Auditors that we need to improve distribution and post-distribution monitoring and reach an agreement with the United Nations agencies that manage the distribution of humanitarian assistance together with the EU on reinforcing the audit work carried out and increasing the reliability of checks.</p>

Through the Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, the Commission grants a level of humanitarian aid that makes the EU the world’s largest donor. The management of humanitarian funds has, for some time, involved a number of critical issues that Parliament and the European Court of Auditors have recognised and often brought to light. With this report, Parliament therefore calls on the Commission to act on a number of important measures to improve the management of humanitarian aid. As stressed by the rapporteur, it is essential to ensure that partners effectively follow up on the findings of audit procedures, and it is important to guarantee that UN reports, drawn up case by case, clearly contain information on the results of individual projects in the area covered by the financial intervention. It is also important to improve the methods for, and practice of, assessing potential partners in the context of framework partnership agreements and, lastly, to pay careful attention, from a strategic perspective, to the possibility that in some cases, humanitarian aid policy may have a negative effect, such as, for example, the chance that food aid might drive down the capacity for local production.

Checks on the use of funds also have to be tightened where the EU delivers humanitarian assistance through joint management together with other partners – the United Nations and other international organisations. In cases of joint management of humanitarian projects, budget implementation and control are delegated to international organisations, and the European Commission only conducts field monitoring and verification missions. In the context of the discharge procedure, the European Court of Auditors and Parliament have frequently criticised the joint management method of international organisations. The criticism is due to the lack of coherence and rigidity, as well as the various sources of confusion stemming from the many added layers of legislation, which are a major cause of errors. Weaknesses in terms of control and follow-up of the use of EU funds have also been the subject of much criticism.

      <p sl="ro">The EU’s total humanitarian aid contribution, including from Member States, was EUR 2.957 billion in 2010, with EU Member States providing 64% and the funds channelled through the Commission amounting to 36%.

In this respect, I welcome the Commission communication on the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, which provides for an increase in the humanitarian aid instrument budget to EUR 6.4 billion over this period. That would amount to an annual average of EUR 915 million, as against EUR 813 million in 2007-2013. I also note with satisfaction the increase in the Emergency Aid Reserve for the same period, bringing it up to EUR 2.5 billion, as well as the proposal for unspent funds in the reserve to be carried over to the following year.

The earthquakes in Haiti and Japan, Cyclone Thane in India, flooding in Pakistan or drought in Somalia would be just some of the most serious examples of disasters, not to mention the humanitarian impact of the civil revolutions which have engulfed the whole world. An ever growing number of refugees need food, shelter and medical assistance. Millions of children are undernourished and, unfortunately, many of them, after receiving treatment, end up in the same situation due to a lack of food. Furthermore, the problems caused by natural disasters are exacerbated by the acts of violence which prevent humanitarian organisations from reaching those in need of help. In these circumstances, I join my colleagues in sounding an alarm bell with regard to making these programmes more efficient. I call on the Commission not only to improve the controls over and monitoring of the funds earmarked for humanitarian aid, but also to impose a bilateral audit and measurable impact indicators, in cooperation with its partners, as part of funding humanitarian programmes.</p>

The report highlights the principle that anyone who has suffered damage must have the right to receive compensation, but that those bringing collective actions must not be in a better position than individual claimants. The EU legal tradition is directed towards solving disputes between individuals rather than through a collective entity. Some Member States’ legal systems have developed differing approaches to the issue of collective redress. It is in this context that the Commission must put forward evidence that, pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, an action at EU level is opportune.

The integration of European markets and the consequent increase in cross-border activities highlight the need for a common European approach to collective redress. The Commission has made a significant effort to address this issue, which hitherto was regulated at Member State level.

As it is a recent legal instrument in Europe, consumers are not familiar with collective redress. The benefits of exercising this right are unarguable. This means that when individual financial claims do not provide them with access to legal proceedings, consumers can initiate a collective action to bring legal proceedings. This also allows the costs incurred by such action to be shared. Collective action provides consumers with an effective means of expression. At the same time, it ensures the most efficient functioning of the single market within which citizens can communicate directly with commercial agencies.

In adopting the Lehne report on Thursday, 2 February, the European Parliament aims to further the debate on this approach and move towards establishing collective redress within the EU, and I fully support this. This new possibility of collective redress allows claimants in the Member States to group their cases together to denounce mass damage. However, the new system will also have to take into account the lessons learned from the excesses of the US system, which is fighting against class actions that are at times abusive or unmeritorious. To this end, the report calls on the Commission to take into consideration a number of key aspects when drawing up its legislative proposal: limiting the admissibility of actions to clearly defined groups by giving a judge discretionary powers to carry out a preliminary admissibility check of any potential collective action and prohibiting punitive damages. The European Parliament has set the ball rolling; it is now essential for the Commission to fill this legal vacuum by ensuring the fundamental right of victims to be compensated.</p>

The European Parliament also welcomes the efforts of Member States to strengthen the rights of victims of unlawful behaviour by introducing or planning to introduce legislation aimed at facilitating redress while avoiding an abusive litigation culture, but also recognises that national collective redress mechanisms are widely divergent, in particular, in terms of scope and procedural characteristics, which may undermine the enjoyment of rights by citizens.</p>

This implies that, in the majority of cases, the infringements perpetrated against these groups go unpunished due to economic barriers (the cost of an individual case being disproportionate to the possible compensation) and psychological ones (fears about the length of procedures) and difficulties in accessing the necessary information.</p>

In this field, the European Union can do better than the US, first of all by encouraging the parties to reach alternative agreements not requiring formal recourse to legal means, thus simplifying and speeding up the process; and subsequently, by establishing a legislative framework that does not leave room for abuse, hence, with specific timeframes for proceedings, and rights to protection in line with European legal traditions. Only in this way will it be possible to prevent a useful tool for protecting citizens becoming a means of unfair competition between private entities.

On the other, in relation to the area of competition, the existence of collective action will mean consumers harmed by an anti-competitive practice that has been penalised pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be able to claim damages. This will lead to the associated application of fines and to the compensation of consumers harmed by such practices. Once again, that could have serious effects for businesses.

According to the research and surveys conducted by the European Commission, one out of five European consumers will not go to court for disputes amounting to less than EUR 1 000, and nearly half of them claim that they would not go to court to obtain redress of less than EUR 200. The main obstacles facing consumers include high costs, the risk of court proceedings as well as lengthy and complicated procedures relating to redress. However, in the case of collective action, as many as 79% of respondents declared their willingness to defend their rights in court. We should take steps to empower European consumers, who represent the weaker party in relation to the entity infringing their rights. A mechanism for collective redress already exists in Poland, and its principles could prove useful when working on the future European instrument. As it is a relatively new instrument, introduced by the Act of 17 December 2009, its application still requires thorough testing. However, it is unquestionably a step in the right direction. A common mechanism for collective redress at EU level is necessary in order to make it possible and easier for citizens and businesses to access and exercise the rights to which they are entitled.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Lehne on a coherent European approach to collective redress. It seems to me that we should examine in detail the added value we might gain from introducing a system of collective redress at European level. Without going as far as the US model, however, it is important to put an end to the legal patchwork in the EU and allow European citizens to exercise their rights effectively and with certainty, especially since bringing an individual action is often difficult and costly. Naturally, this system must have a rigid framework and ensure a fair balance to prevent abuse and a shift towards a more litigious society, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.</p>

In many cases, such as misleading advertising, lack of transparency of contracts, etc., damages might not occur and priority should be given to stopping any further unlawful behaviour. The Commission itself has indicated how Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on consumer protection cooperation, as well as Directive 2009/22/EC on injunctions for the protection of consumer interests (the Injunctions Directive), can be improved in order to strengthen cooperation and injunctive relief.</p>

However, enforcement of EU law by European and national authorities must remain in the foreground, since these authorities have public-law investigative instruments at their disposal, which cannot be made available to private parties; to this extent, private enforcement continues to be complementary.</p>

      <p sl="hu">As with the preparation of all new EU-level laws, when examining the possibility of collective redress, it is the interests of EU citizens, which, in this case, largely means the injured parties, that must take priority.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Before creating a proposal on the subject, the Commission and all other legislators must provide appropriate justification for this form of legal remedy, which is not entirely known in continental legal culture. While the actual effects of this new type of rules of procedure are surrounded by uncertainty, if we give priority to the interests of individuals, we can highlight some positive results that can be achieved through the common rules of procedure by means of an option of collective redress.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Cases of abuse where the individual assertion of rights can seem hopeless are a frequent occurrence, especially when corporations with extensive capital and infrastructure are involved. Sometimes, the consumer or the client is unable to individually bear all the burdens necessary to enforce his rights provided by the law, and eventually decides not to exercise them. In such cases, joint action by the injured parties, in accordance with the rules of a collective form of redress and strictly based on individual decisions as regards participation, can be justified.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that any future legal instrument, including in the field of collective redress, must focus on the objective of enabling EU citizens and corporations to exercise the rights guaranteed to them by the Community. The report reflects these ideas.</p>

The integration of the European markets in addition to the increase in cross-border activities mean that this approach is absolutely essential. The national procedures do not offer any real solutions at cross-border level. Collective judicial redress, currently available at national level in 14 EU Member States, does not allow for optimum compensation when it comes to mass damage, such as flight cancellations, defective products, etc. Extending this redress to all EU Member States would ensure an effective approach that protects European consumers.

      <p sl="it">I have always maintained that alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods are the most effective type of mediation in consumer-related disputes. The single market and the Internet have created a virtual trading space which consumers want to be able to trust. Despite this, consumers are often completely on their own against manufacturers. It is a battle between David and Goliath that does not leave room for recognition of the rights enshrined by the directives which we work to protect on a daily basis. Class action is an experience consumers have embarked upon in order to ensure that their voices are heard, as otherwise they would be isolated and therefore weak. Personally, I believe that there should be more incentives for ADR mechanisms, even if they often depend on the trader’s willingness to cooperate. The availability of an effective judicial redress system would act as a strong incentive for parties to agree an out-of-court settlement, which is likely to avoid a considerable amount of litigation. The setting up of ADR schemes at European level should be encouraged, so as to allow effective settlement of disputes as a more attractive option than court proceedings, and have the power to order the parties involved to first seek a collective consensual resolution of the claim before launching collective court proceedings.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Regulation of legal and procedural issues constitutes one of the most sensitive areas of EU law. As such, it is understood that Union regulation began by standardising the commonly set criteria for the international jurisdiction of courts, by determining the commonly set criteria for substantive law applicable to disputes of a certain kind, by supporting alternative means of dispute resolution, or even by introducing procedural models for low-value actions. Therefore, EU-level regulation of collective redress represents progress in this area: in this framework, there will now be a ‘type’ of litigation relationship – mass litigation – that is regulated uniformly throughout the Union. This is an intervention that could meet with resistance, since the regulation to be introduced could clash with certain aspects of national procedural law.

Nevertheless, we need to establish collective redress in Europe: it is clear that when a group of citizens falls victim to the same infringement, individual actions are not always the solution, whether the goal is to put an end to an illegal practice or obtain redress, especially when the individual damage is minor in comparison to the cost of legal action. Of course, as I have already said, these actions must be clearly defined (legal standing, opt-in, no third-party pre-financing, etc.) in order to avoid the excesses of the US system. However, the debate must not cripple legislative action.

Using comparative nutrition claims is, in fact, currently only permitted on condition that the product contains at least 30% less of the substance indicated than the average in the product category. Use of the proposed claim would only have been allowed for one year, in order to encourage the gradual reformulation of products.

      <p sl="ro">The purpose of the resolution tabled by Parliament is to force the Commission to come up with a better legislative proposal. The main problem with the current proposal is the possibility of displaying a reduction as ‘X% less sugar’ on food product packaging. In any case, this wording is clearly misleading. The reduction in sugar does not have any effect on the product’s energy content because the sugar will be substituted by other carbohydrates, which means that the total number of calories will remain the same. In addition, the wording ‘contains X% less’ would distort competition on the food industry market for products which already have a low sugar content, as such wording compares the product with itself and not with the whole group of similar food products.</p>

Links have even been established between sugar consumption and diseases such as cancer, or cardiovascular diseases. Diabetes and obesity also remain substantial health challenges. In this regard, it is crucial to inform consumers of what is in the food they eat, and encourage the production of foods that contain less fat and sugars. Therefore, the Commission proposal allowing product labels to state decreases in fat or sugar content compared with the previous version of the product was wise.

It is important that consumers are well informed about the products that they buy so that they are in a position to make a balanced and responsible choice. They must be able to compare the content of products. The Commission proposal [B7-0000/2011] to allow claims such as ‘This product now contains X% less salt/fat, etc.’ provides consumers with insufficient information. In such claims, the product, after all, is only compared with itself, rather than with other similar products that might well actually have much lower contents of salt/fat, etc. Better regulation is required that both informs consumers properly and provides an impetus for manufacturers to develop better food. Giving manufacturers the opportunity to state on their packaging that their products have been improved can act as a stimulus for them to make positive changes.</p>

Allowing one and the same characteristic (in this case, a reduction in the amount of nutrients) to be described in several claims is therefore a flawed practice. Such claims can be used even if other conditions that consumers expect are not satisfied (such as a reduction in the amount of calories in the case of reduced sugar).

Consumers want clear labelling and simple nutritional information, not marketing operations disguised as the protection of information rights. Claiming that a foodstuff ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ might lead to unfair competition with regard to existing claims, such as ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’. Furthermore, in the latter case, a reduction of at least 10% (for micronutrients), 25% (for sodium) or 30% (for sugars/fats) by comparison with other similar products is required. Effectively, a consumer might assume that the quantified statement in the ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ claim signifies a greater reduction than that implied by the ‘reduced [nutrient]’ or ‘light’ claims, despite the requirements being much stricter for the latter than for the ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ claim, for which a minimum reduction of just 15% is specified.

The labelling of products should not be misleading or ambiguous. This is especially important with food. The nutrition claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ is questionable, since it allows for the nutritional values of a product to be compared only with a previous version of that product. It therefore does not take account of how high the nutrient’s starting level was. The risk is that what is, in fact, a very unhealthy product, can be made to sound healthy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ is more a way to promote marketing than bring added value to consumer information. There are already claims regarding nutrient content on the market, such as ‘light/lite’ and ‘reduced [nutrient]’. The proposed nutrition claim would only cause additional confusion among consumers.

      <p sl="fr">Nutrition and health claims should only be allowed if they are true, unambiguous and not misleading. However, the new nutrition claim which was submitted to us (‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’), could have been misleading for consumers. This claim involved reformulated products being compared with a previous version of the product, without the consumer necessarily knowing the starting level of the nutrient in question – this nutritional value could well be excessively high in comparison with other products on the market, which, not having been reformulated, would therefore not be allowed to bear a nutrition claim. A further problem is that we know that when sugars are reduced, consumers expect a reduction in energy. Yet the text would have allowed the ‘reduced fats/sugars’ claim to be made even when the product’s energy content was still equal to the energy contained in a similar product. Finally, the new claims might have led to confusion with existing claims, such as ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’, for which the requirements are, in fact, stricter. For these reasons, in this vote, I rejected the draft amendment of the regulation on nutrition claims.</p>

The amendments proposed by the European Commission, which would provide an opportunity to indicate on the packaging of food products the fact that they contain 15℅ less sugar, fats or salt, for example, would mislead purchasers about the real energy value and healthiness of products. With particular reference to sugar, it can be replaced with sweeteners, as a result of which the product’s energy value remains the same. It is important to protect the public from inappropriate product marketing and to ensure, as far as possible, that there are equal opportunities for competition between large and small enterprises.

I do not think anybody really disputes that. The issue is precisely how the industry is allowed to communicate this information to consumers, or, in other words, the methodology behind the health claim. And the fact remains that, with this proposed health claim, a product claiming to have ‘x percent less’ fat could still have a very high fat content compared to similar products on the market. This is why a significant majority of us in this House believe that this claim is essentially misleading.

The ‘light/lite’ claim means a reduction of at least 10% (for micronutrients), 25% (for sodium) or 30% (for sugars/fats) in comparison with other similar products. The new wording being proposed is ambiguous, misleading and confusing for consumers and might act as a disincentive to producers to meet the requirements for the ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’ claims, as it is easier to reduce a nutrient by 15% than by 30%.</p>

Given the number of nutrition claims already allowed, it is already hard for consumers to know which product is the best for themselves and their family. In particular, the new claim could have caused confusion with the existing ‘reduced’ claim, which actually requires a larger reduction of 30%, and this must be in comparison with a range of similar products on the market rather than previous versions of the same product. Now that Parliament has said no to this claim, the Commission will have to rethink their approach.

In the case of Romania, which is lacking in its absorption of EU funds, these measures are particularly useful because it will make it possible for the unspent funds that are allocated to be used to create SMEs and generate new jobs. I hope that the European Council meeting in March will adopt a consistent plan for implementing these decisions, including specific programmes for stimulating employment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">While the European Parliament was not initially very receptive to adopting this agreement, we have managed to improve the latest version of the text and secure the inclusion in the Treaty of the objectives of economic growth and job creation in the European Union. The Member States need to stabilise their public finances. Austerity measures and budgetary stability are only part of the solution to the crisis. Europe is facing an ageing population while, on the other hand, the youth unemployment rate has never been so high, meaning the Member States are facing enormous challenges. The Member States need to implement structural reforms in order to overcome these obstacles. Europe should also focus on measures leading to economic growth and on promoting competitiveness. I therefore voted for this resolution. However, there is also a need to establish a bailout fund quickly, to create Eurobonds and to introduce an EU-level financial transaction tax.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Who could ignore the fact that the EU is currently in the throes of a deep crisis, which is not only an economic and social one, but a global one and even one in which the EU has lost its direction? Yet, our Heads of State or Government persist along the path which has widened the gap between the people of the EU and the EU itself. After having ignored EU citizens’ referendum votes on the Constitutional Treaty, they signed a new Treaty amongst themselves, which was negotiated practically behind closed doors and focused on austerity and budgetary discipline. There has been no real inclusion of the European Parliament, no public debate and no cooperation with national parliaments. Moreover, in terms of content, there is nothing on growth or future investment. As I said during the vote on our previous resolution, I am more than doubtful about this new Treaty. I therefore voted against today’s resolution as I feel that it is not critical enough of this Treaty that is being presented to us as the only possible route. As well as being quite useless in content (since many of the measures can be achieved through EU law) and incomplete (for it lacks balance between austerity and growth), it is highly questionable in form: if we want to regain the faith of EU citizens, this is surely not the way to go about it.</p>

The European Parliament (EP) recognises that fiscal stability is an important element of resolving the current crisis, but stresses that economic recovery requires measures to strengthen solidarity and boost sustainable growth and employment. The EP welcomes the fact that the European Council now recognises this but insists that concrete and far-reaching measures are needed. We need to understand that simply making savings is not enough to overcome the crisis in the European Union. In order to ensure fiscal stability, the European Parliament proposes not just making use of the series of measures provided for, but establishing project bonds, a road map for stability bonds and introducing a financial transaction tax at European level, for which the Commission has already made a proposal. Furthermore, the EP insists that the contracting parties fully respect their commitment to integrate, within a maximum period of five years, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance into the EU Treaties and asks for the remaining weaknesses of the Treaty of Lisbon to be tackled on this occasion.</p>

Furthermore, based on the international agreement, the facility to exercise an alternative fiscal policy is denied to democratically elected governments. This is a scandal. The joint motion not only fails to reject the international agreement; it supports the recent changes to the architecture of EMU (economic governance, European Semester, Euro Plus Pact). The changes in question are the most reactionary, anti-democratic and extreme neoliberal response to the current crisis.

The current economic and financial crisis is dragging on, obliging the Member States to adopt drastic measures to combat the deficit, with significant reductions in sums for investment, the consequences of which are reflected in increased unemployment rates, particularly amongst young people, and a lack of economic growth. The number of young adults under 25 years of age has already passed the 5.5 million mark, which is 22% of the total number of unemployed. I therefore welcome the increased rate of contribution to European programmes, and the series of measures intended to promote youth employment and support small and medium-sized enterprises.

      <p sl="en">The outcomes of the EU summit of 30 January, 2012 were received with mixed reactions by colleagues. From my perspective, I welcome the announcement on the new fiscal treaty and hope it will be implemented without further delays. The Council’s decision to focus on growth as a complementary means to austerity is essential, since strict budgetary rules alone cannot solve the deepening of the crisis. Supporting SMEs, entrepreneurship and self-employment initiatives are the only way to encourage economic expansion, job creation and improving the EU’s long-term competitiveness. On the other hand, I deplore the fact only 25 Members rather than the whole EU decided to join the treaty. Because the agreed treaty does not really guarantee fiscal stability, coordinated action between all 27 EU Members is needed to restore investment and growth to Europe. Another point of contrast to EU shared solidarity is the exclusion of the European Parliament from participating in future meetings on EU governance. As a directly elected body, the European Parliament must be involved on a basis of equality with other EU institutions.

      <p sl="pt">I voted for the resolution on the new treaty, known as the ‘fiscal compact’, because I agree with it in broad terms. However, I have three objections, albeit isolated ones. Firstly, I consider it an exaggeration to state that ‘virtually all the elements’ of the treaty can be achieved within the framework of the EU Treaties in force, thus rendering this new treaty unnecessary. In truth, its most important items – first and foremost, the obligation for Member States to include binding rules on balanced budgets in their domestic legal systems – could not be the subject of EU legislation. Secondly, I agree that the treaty does not solve the Union’s current budgetary and economic crisis, but nor is that its purpose; rather, it is intended to prevent future crises. The present budgetary crisis could not be overcome without assuring creditors now that there will not be others in the future. Thirdly, while I entirely agree that a genuine ‘fiscal union’ is much more than budgetary discipline, also including the issue of joint loans for both the national budgets and the Union budget, I do not think it possible to omit the requirement for tax harmonisation. The very idea of the internal market is incompatible with ‘fiscal competition’ and ‘tax dumping’.</p>

Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel have imposed an ideological diktat on the other governments and on everybody in the EU without consulting citizens and have even bypassed the usual constitutional amendment process, for which each Member State has its own, particular rules. Along with my fellow Members from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I have signed and tabled an alternative motion for a resolution. Our resolution is the only one to clearly reject this democratic show of strength that threatens to destroy the sovereignty of the peoples; it is the only one which clearly opposes the introduction of a new rule which sets the figure for Member States’ structural deficits at 0.5% of nominal GDP and which will, in fact, result in permanent austerity throughout the whole of Europe; again, it is the only one to object to the proposed sanctions and to call for public consultation on this matter. I therefore voted in favour of the resolution that my Group and I tabled, and against the consensus held by the liberals, conservatives, socialist and the greens on this agreement.</p>

The agreement on the fiscal compact reached by 25 out of 27 Member States attempts to bring government debt to within reasonable levels and to ensure that Member States manage to balance their budgets.

This is an historic turning point: it will set the balanced budget rule in stone, thereby strengthening mutual trust between Member States. The economic governance for which we Members of the European Parliament have been calling for a long time is now becoming a reality. Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel have been hard at work from the beginning. The Franco-German pair shared the same view of the situation and proposed the same solution: if we are to recover from the economic crisis, we need to clean up our finances. The recovery will only happen if we lay solid foundations. My continuous support for this strategy has always been based on this idea. Whilst the vast majority of European governments have been pragmatic in their support for the treaty, I note that the French socialists have isolated themselves once again within their own European political family.

Whatever the case, it is important to remember that the final text represents a step forward, despite everything, and that it has been possible to make some of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament, so as to frame this treaty with the Community method to a greater extent: first and foremost, the commitment to incorporating the content of the treaty into the EU legal framework, but also the acknowledgement of the right of contracting parties with a currency other than the euro to participate in summits on the euro relating to the competitiveness and overall architecture of the euro area.

The agreement may be described in three words: pointless, ineffective and wrong. It is fortunately ineffective, because it could have done more harm than good.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although the EU Council did achieve a declaration on growth, Europe lacks concrete solutions on how to get out of the current recession and economic crisis. The European Parliament, which represents Europe’s 500 million citizens, is not party to this agreement. Such a move does not unite Europe: it only serves to divide it further.

This agreement on ‘stability, coordination and governance’ does not represent European parliamentarianism. It would perhaps be more apt to call it the ‘EU2’ Treaty.

The resolution approved in Parliament today is irrelevant, despite the fact that it recognises the importance of incorporating a tax on financial transactions and project bonuses, as it does not propose an innovative and more specific response to the crisis.

I am voting for this resolution because I fully agree that the European institutions and relevant Member States should adopt concrete measures intended to stimulate economic growth, to finance small and medium-sized enterprises, to create jobs, and to improve the workings of the single market.

I welcome the unanimous backing given by European Union foreign ministers last week to impose an embargo on Iranian crude oil, but this is only a first step. The reaction from officials in Tehran was to be expected, with the Iranian Parliament wishing to approve a bill suspending completely oil exports from Iran to Member States of the European Union before the European embargo on Iranian oil fully comes into force.

The political situation in the Middle East, specifically the Persian Gulf, remains very complicated and still has serious consequences for the global economy as a result of the oil industry. Indeed, Iran’s arrogance towards Western countries, and particularly the United States, is the driving force behind the development of a new conflict. Iran, proud of its noble past founded on the history of ancient Persia, is taking on the role of a great power: it is refusing to sit at the negotiating table with the international community and is not allowing access to independent inspectors who could evaluate the implementation of its nuclear programme. At the same time, following several condemnations from international organisations, like the UN Security Council – of which it is a member – and sanctions imposed by the EU and the US, it still fails to respect the most basic human rights. I voted for this resolution, as well as for other proposals already adopted by this Parliament, since the Iranian nuclear programme represents a threat to that region and the world.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union’s decision to impose more unilateral sanctions on Iran simply confirms its subordination to the militarist agenda of the US in the region, as well as the convergence of the geostrategic interests of the two imperialist blocs in the region. It should be remembered that these sanctions follow on from the movement of vast military resources to the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. It is a decision that has contributed dangerously to escalating a conflict that, as is clear, has nothing to do with seeking peaceful solutions and diplomatic negotiations. This is a decision that seriously threatens Iran’s sovereignty and the Iranian people’s right to live in peace, and it could also have extremely negative economic consequences for several countries. These unilateral sanctions are also profoundly hypocritical, imposed as they are by nuclear powers like the US, France or the UK. Furthermore, the European Union has been continuing its close economic and military cooperation with Israel, one of the countries that has a nuclear arsenal and is acting completely outside the most basic principles of international law.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is quite indisputable that Iran is failing to fulfil its international obligations in the area of its nuclear activities. If its international obligations are to be anything more than a scrap of paper, they must be both enforceable and enforced. In this respect, it is right and proper that the EU has resorted to sanctions. It must be ensured, however, that the sanctions are effective and that the leaders of the regime, who can change things, suffer, and not ordinary Iranians who are not responsible for the situation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Apart from sanctions, however, the greatest possible emphasis must be placed on the second dimension of diplomatic relations with Iran, that is, namely negotiations. Baroness Ashton, the ministers of the Member States and the Council should initiate a dialogue with Iran. This should not only be about the disputed and sensitive issue of Iran’s nuclear programme, but also about other topics, such as stability in the region, relations with neighbours, and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If a consensus could be reached in one area, if a partnership of trust can be established, then there will be a greater chance of agreement in other areas, including the nuclear programme.

Iran’s enrichment activities potentially violate six United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and 11 IAEA Board resolutions, as demonstrated by the recent start of operations to enrich uranium to a level of up to 20% in the underground facility in Fordow near Qom. Iran must immediately stop its development of enrichment technology, which is far beyond the necessities to ensure a secure fuel supply for civil purposes and demonstrates disregard for international concerns over clandestine military intentions.

I find it very regrettable that similar sanctions cannot be imposed at UN level, due to the Chinese and Russian veto.

In other words, the oil boycott would not achieve the desired effect and the EU would be placed at an even greater disadvantage in geostrategic terms. We will have precisely the situation that exiled Iranians have warned against: the measures will hit the wrong people and will fuel anger against the West in increasingly large swathes of the population.

It talks, for example, about supporting sports for girls by removing all obstacles, including religious and cultural barriers. In this respect, one important change will be to ensure that women are better represented in sports governing bodies. The report also proposes to establish a blacklist of violent supporters, or ‘hooligans’, and to continue the fight against doping, illegal betting and match fixing. The European Parliament also wishes to ensure that high-level athletes receive a good education, so that sportspeople will have a secure future when they leave their career. Finally, the project for an annual ‘European Day of Sports’ will help to reinforce European identity through sport.</p>

I condemn displays of violence, hooliganism and racism during sporting contests. They must be stamped out because they go against the very spirit of sport. I welcome the report’s provisions in this area, including the proposal to ban supporters who have displayed violent behaviour from entering any stadium in Europe. I regret the violent incidents which have occurred at some football matches in Romania in recent months. I hope that the Law on combating violence in sport, announced right at the start of this year, will help eliminate this behaviour during sporting contests.

It is certainly high time we had a dedicated budget for sport. Although the sums involved are low compared with the amount of money that changes hands in the world of sport (EUR 30 million per year between 2014 and 2020), I welcome this step forward. The European Commission has taken note of the new provisions contained in the Treaty of Lisbon. The Fisas report highlights the fact that sport is a multi-faceted area that has a strong economic dimension and also plays a vital role in society. If we consider the need to value the role of volunteers, to prepare athletes through training for life after their professional sports careers, to combat illegal sports betting, to coordinate the fight against doping, or to regulate the profession of sports agent, there are certainly enough areas for action. These include areas on which I tabled amendments that were included in the final report, such as the protection of minors during international transfers and the need for cooperation between the EU and the Council of Europe, which is very active in the area of sports.

Through sport, it is also possible to promote the social inclusion of disadvantaged categories such as people with disabilities, and to foster the human and social growth of young people. They are increasingly disorientated in a modern world devoid of reference points, in terms of values and humanity. Finally, the reference to the need to properly safeguard traditional, local sports seems to me particularly welcome.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because sport is a sector that is growing very rapidly, both within the European Union and outside. Statistics indicate that the increase in sporting activity has created around 15 million jobs in the EU. The sport sector employs 5.4% of the working population, and it has an annual turnover of approximately EUR 407 billion, or 3.65% of Europe’s GDP. Sport plays an important role in society and helps to strengthen social well-being because it boosts employment and integration and contributes to society and social development. The European Union was recently given new competence for sport and it is urged to contribute to promoting sport. In response to the Commission’s communication ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, the European Parliament proposes that at EU level, the focus should be on issues of international importance such as doping, trafficking, athlete mobility, racism and violence in sport. Parliament also proposes examining and addressing the issues of money laundering, match fixing, human trafficking and the exploitation of minors. There is also a proposal to create a European register of people who have displayed violent behaviour during games in the past. The discussion of such problems at EU level could make a significant contribution to their resolution and this would give the European dimension in sport real added value.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Lisbon Treaty has provided a new EU competence in the area of sport. However, this does not mean that a specific article has been created for it, but a legal basis is provided for sport in the section of the Treaties on education, vocational training and young people. Indeed, Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that the EU’s objective is to promote the European dimension in sport. Sport itself constitutes an important social activity and a public good. For many, it is one of the most important forms of recreation, whether they take part or are only spectators. One of the biggest benefits of sport is that it brings people together, no matter what their origin, background, religious beliefs or economic status. Sport promotes the active contribution made by European citizens to society and helps foster a sense of social inclusion. Doping remains a major threat to sport. The prevention of doping in sport must be based on a clear understanding of the complex nature of this problem, as well as on extensively combining the strategies of all the authorities involved in sport, with the aim of successfully eradicating doping in sport, which is acknowledged as being a serious problem that is detrimental to the fundamental principles of sport. This is why I think that the EU should be more actively involved in tackling doping.</p>

Although many issues are strictly for individual Member States, the EU should focus its attention on big issues such as doping, the mobility of athletes, and racism and violence in sport. In addition, every effort should be made to determinedly combat all types of unlawful activity, such as money laundering, match fixing and exploitation of minors, which are a real threat to sport and the values it stands for.

      <p sl="it">I voted for the Fisas Ayxela report because I believe it is an important exercise in setting out priorities for European action in the sporting sphere. I welcome the reference to respect for the fundamental rights of athletes during checks conducted as part of anti-doping procedures. It is vital to ensure respect for these rights, specifically by identifying a Europe-wide procedure to protect athletes and not to leave room at the edges for arbitrary action, which could have extremely damaging effects on the athletes’ careers. The use of biological passports as tools for investigation, rather than prevention, has given rise to highly discriminatory episodes, and led to the end of the careers of some athletes where the burden of proof has been reversed, even without clear evidence of doping. In such a situation, reversing the burden of proof that applies to an accused person runs counter to the fundamental principles of human rights and, in particular, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I should therefore like to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela for his efforts to guarantee and protect not only the interests of sports federations and associations, but also the freedoms and fundamental rights of athletes.</p>

Sport represents a link between EU citizens, as anyone is free to practice it regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religion, age, nationality or social situation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The economic added value of sport in the EU is extraordinary: it provides 15 million jobs (representing 5.4% of the active population) and accounts for 3.65% of European GDP. Furthermore, sport has a positive influence on Member State health care budgets as it favourably affects the health of European citizens. We must not forget about the potential role of sport in invigorating tourism either.</p>

It would represent a significant step in this direction if sport could become a beneficiary of the European Structural Funds. Special training courses for outstanding sportspeople who wish to pursue studies in higher education are indispensable. The fight against doping must continue unabated. Sport must be supported in education because (in addition to its numerous other positive effects) it facilitates the dismantling of social barriers and the integration of marginalised groups.</p>

As a branch of the economy, sport contributes to economic growth and supports job creation. Sport also has many negative attributes, of course, such as doping or the violence and indiscipline of fans, which sometimes ends in brutal fights in stadiums or on the streets. In the matter of stadium violence, however, the report by Santiago Fisas Ayxela does not offer any incentive for improvement or suggestion for change. I would therefore like to call on the Commission, the Council and the rapporteur to pay greater attention to this sensitive and complex topic.

In addition to sport’s contribution to public health, its educational and social functions make it an attractive means of influencing people’s behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I share the opinion that sport has the potential to help groups of young people who are vulnerable and at risk to get back on track, and this potential should be developed and supported. On the other hand, it is undeniable that we often witness violence and displays of aggression from supporters of different teams at sports events, especially in football. I support the need for strict and coordinated measures against such misbehaviour as it may not only have direct adverse consequences, but could also have indirect ones, such as negatively influencing the behavioural development of children and young people.</p>

      <p sl="it">I supported the Fisas Ayxela report because I believe that it highlighted well the main issues requiring intervention by the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union the task of developing the European dimension of sport by promoting cooperation between bodies responsible for sport and protecting the physical and moral integrity of sportsmen and sportswomen. Sport contributes to the attainment of the EU’s strategic objectives, playing an important role in various sectors such as social inclusion, education, training and public health.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, corruption, money laundering and other forms of financial crime affect sport at the local, national and international levels. Given the extent to which the sector is internationalised, corruption in sport often has cross-border aspects. The Member States should therefore take all steps necessary to prevent and penalise unlawful activities that compromise the integrity of sport.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, with reference to illegal betting, it is vital for the Member States to develop instruments designed to foster cooperation between public authorities, sports authorities and gambling operators in relation to cases of sports fraud, as well as tackling the issue of gambling addiction and the protection of minors in this sphere.</p>

Sport at all ages is an important area with great potential for improving the overall level of health of Europeans and therefore, the EU and Member States are urged to encourage involvement in sport and to promote a healthy lifestyle, fully exploiting the opportunities of sport, because ultimately, this will reduce spending on health care. I am pleased about the focus on disabled people, encouraging them to take up sporting activities and providing adequate funding to develop sport and competitions for people with disabilities, above all, by giving them access to sport and equal opportunities to participate in sport and use sports facilities adapted to the needs of disabled athletes free of charge.

The attempt to truss it up with pan-European recommendations and pan-European institutions under the pretext of promoting universal bliss will, in my opinion, have an effect that is contrary to the rapporteur’s expectations and assumptions. Sport naturally encourages integration, but it should not be misused for the artificial furthering of European integration.

It is to be hoped that the European institutions can exercise greater control over the world of sport, given the abuses being seen. In order to tackle such abuse, regulation would, most probably, enable the standard of sports governance to be improved. Therefore, taking action to regulate the activities of sports agents and player transfers, as well as fighting fraud and doping, are all measures that should produce a useful result in these terms. Finally, establishing a ‘European Day of Sports’ and designating an annual ‘European Capital of Sport’ are, in my view, excellent tools for bringing citizens closer to sport.</p>

Our young people know how to make their own choices, provided that there is an alternative.

Sport is very important from the point of view of maintaining and promoting health, since the absence of physical activity has a detrimental effect on the health of Europe’s citizens. Sport also has an extremely strong economic impact, providing work, directly or indirectly, for 15 million Europeans (5.4% of the working population) and added value of roughly EUR 407 billion. As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I consider it important that studies be organised at the European level on the distinctive features of women’s sport, the reasons why women and girls stop doing sports and the continued inequality with regard to sporting opportunities for women. The popularisation of women’s sport should be improved, because it is clearly overshadowed by men’s sport, and, as a result, many young girls unfortunately do not consider sport to be sufficiently important.

Finally, the profession of sports agent should also be regulated, in the view of the European Parliament.

      <p sl="sv">During the vote in the European Parliament on 2 February, I chose to vote against the report on the European dimension in sport. It is my view that sport is a national matter, and in Sweden, the Swedish Sports Confederation is independent and has a great deal of autonomy. With EU programmes and the introduction of a ‘dedicated and ambitious budget for sports policy’, sport will start to become a more supranational activity instead of being an independent and important element in civil society. Proposals for European coach education within the framework of the Lifelong Learning programmes, measures to enable the financing of sport through lotteries, payment of agents’ fees in instalments and EU flags on sports clothing are examples of measures that I consider to lie entirely outside the realms of politics.</p>

The European Parliament supports emphasis on the European dimension of sport, stressing issues like the resolution of major problems, the need for adequate management, its importance for tourism, the issue of fairness in sporting competitions, the budget, traditional games and sports, opportunities and jobs, training and mobility, cooperation with third countries and international organisations, and the European sporting identity itself.</p>

Sport plays an important part in the European economy as it directly or indirectly employs around 15 million people (5.4% of the working population) and accounts for 3.65% of EU GDP every year.

We can learn a lot from sport: the EuroBasket tournament recently held in Lithuania demonstrated the enthusiasm, goal striving and unity that is unfortunately lacking in Lithuanian politics and public life. Sport is poorly funded in Lithuania. This is understandable given the economic crisis affecting my country. However, we cannot simply blame the economic crisis for the poor funding of sport. Another problem is the weak administration of Lithuania’s sports system. Last year, LTL 39 million (a little more than EUR 11 million) was allocated to sport in Lithuania. By contrast, Latvia’s sports budget is almost double that amount. There is a need for greater transparency and better administration. Part of the problem is caused by the distribution of funds – while some larger Lithuanian sports federations receive the biggest proportion of funding, several dozen federations are left without a penny. The issue of the sustainable funding of Lithuanian sport should be examined more closely.</p>

For this reason, it is important to me that we should support the great efforts being made by people at grassroots level, while it is a key task for the future to anchor support for sport as securely as possible in all relevant funding programmes. Unfortunately, there is as yet no reference to sport in the draft regulations for cohesion policy, even though other areas are mentioned where sport can make an important contribution. I would call for sport to be expressly mentioned. This would give the Member States a good basis for their operational programmes. The proposal for a sports programme within the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme is also a good idea. I particularly welcome the idea that we should foster sport at grassroots level and as a voluntary activity, rather than promoting top-level sport.

I find it increasingly difficult to persuade my constituents of the benefits of a single market when the EU time and time again takes every opportunity to both depart from the original objectives of a community of trading nations and also to impose a federal EU identity on its unwitting and unwilling citizens. Natasha Kuchinskaya, one of the first Soviet gymnasts to take part in the Olympics, described the USSR’s attitude to sport as follows: ‘Sport was considered the prestige of the government.

I agree that the EP, at EU level, should urge the Member States to speed up the transposition of the Waste Framework Directive into national law, that there should be reinforcement of the existing European Environment Agency for monitoring purposes rather than creating new instances, and that the Member States should be recommended to impose, in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, adequate and dissuasive fines and penalties for illegal disposal of waste, especially with regard to toxic and hazardous waste.</p>

It is also about greater communication about the merits of pre-sorting waste, and driving home the point that, although adequate waste management can be expensive, it can attract investment and create jobs. Everyone remembers when ponds containing red toxic sludge were breached in Hungary leading to the devastation of a village, or the landfill, near Marseille, which, in 2008, was close to saturation, despite being well managed.

With a systematic over-reliance on landfill, monitoring and control alone are not enough to prevent household waste being contaminated by toxic waste. We need to develop these policies as early in the chain as possible by making improvements to sorting, collection and recycling and encouraging waste recovery, and also by providing an effective tracking system for toxic waste. Landfills should be the last resort.

      <p sl="ro">EU policy on waste has evolved in the last 30 years through a series of environmental action plans and a legislative framework whose aim is to reduce the adverse impact on the environment and health and to create a resource- and energy-efficient economy. In some Member States, recycling and recovery are the main waste management options deployed, with a reduction in the use of landfill sites to a negligible level, whereas other Member States still use landfills for most of their waste. This also presents an economic opportunity. Indeed, in 2008, this sector recorded a turnover of EUR 145 billion, which accounted for roughly 1% of EU GDP and provided 2 million jobs. Compliance with EU policy would help create a sector providing 2.4 million jobs and a total annual turnover of EUR 187 billion.

Instead, in the majority of the EU, we can see a worrying delay in implementing strategies for dealing with waste and an excessive dependence on landfills. Accordingly, we urgently need to put in place a coherent policy and work with greater determination to properly apply current legislation by setting out sustainable waste disposal plans.

The Commission is encouraged to propose clearer and more specific criteria for the location of landfills in relation to local housing, schools or health facilities in order to ensure more robust guarantees against potential risks to human health and the environment, bearing in mind that there are a large number of variables and local considerations that need to be taken into account. I believe that meeting legally established recycling and prevention targets requires the active participation of civil society, improved stakeholder participation and increased public awareness. The recommendations contained in this report should contribute to better implementation of waste management policy in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The increasing volume of waste is the result of a modern lifestyle, and is a problem that involves each and every one of us, from major industrial plants right down to individual households. Waste is dangerous both to human and animal health, as well as to our planet’s ecosystem. It is also an equally important issue for rural areas, which generate many types of waste, and where sometimes electrical or particularly hazardous asbestos waste, for example, is dumped next to municipal, biodegradable waste. These areas require proper systems for the regular collection of this waste, and such systems should be accompanied by practical information campaigns.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As we read in the report, the advances made in waste management policies differ quite significantly between individual Member States. In countries such as Austria or Denmark, waste management is very advanced, while other countries, mainly the new Member States, still lack proper legal regulations and administrative procedures.

      <p sl="lt">In the resolution we adopted today, we drew attention to two very important aspects. Firstly, the Commission and the Member States must devote more attention to raising public awareness of the need for and benefits of waste management. Some Member States are lagging behind when it comes to waste sorting, above all because the public are not convinced of its benefits. Secondly, the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process has a significant effect on transparent waste management. When designing and building waste management facilities (above all, incinerators and landfills), a lack of transparency and public ignorance during the EIA leads to waste crises or even disasters (as demonstrated by real examples in Italy, Spain and other countries). During the next review of the EIA Directive, we must therefore really ensure that the public is adequately and genuinely involved in consultations, that public opinion is taken into account, and that the process itself is transparent and independent.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the resolution on waste management because guaranteeing that our citizens’ health and well-being are protected is of fundamental importance. The 177 infringement procedures opened by the EU reveal that there are thought to be 619 illegal landfills across the European Union. Our citizens are asking for clarity and procedural transparency, and the number of petitions that Parliament receives on waste and landfills speaks volumes: between 2004 and 2010, 114 petitions alleging breaches have been declared admissible. Forty per cent of these concern the authorisation procedure for new plants and another 40% relate to the operation of existing ones, not to mention landfills and incinerators. Figures from Eurostat show that EU citizens produce, on average, 513 kg of waste per year. The questions raised by citizens during the public consultation process and the Environmental Impact Assessment on planned locations for new landfills often concern alleged violations of protected areas, as in the case of the landfill in the Vesuvius national park, or fears over a negative impact on health and well-being. Europe should provide incentives for citizens who are inclined to pre-sort their waste, thereby allowing taxes to be lowered and reducing the impact of waste processing on the land and on citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Each year, a whopping 2 billion tonnes of waste, including 40 million tonnes of special waste, is generated in the EU, which is an enormous amount, particularly in view of our population. If we continue along this path, the rising disposal costs will soon mean that we will be drowning in our own waste. Alternatively, we could follow the US model and simply ship our waste electrical and electronic equipment to the developing world as ‘development aid’. In addition, many materials can only be recycled to a limited extent because they can only undergo the recycling process a limited number of times. In other cases, only a small proportion can be recycled. It is of central importance that we should take control of downcycling, the practice of transporting or illegally storing waste throughout Europe. What might be helpful, therefore, is the combination of an increase in recycling rates together with strict controls on exports of electronic waste and a shifting of the cost burden on to those who cause the waste. Even more important are preventive measures to avoid waste, something that is not given enough consideration in the report. Ordering everyone to use energy-saving bulbs has actually generated more waste, not less. In addition, the amount of hazardous waste produced by nuclear power stations should not be underestimated, while the final resting place of this waste is still undecided. On account of these considerations, I have abstained from voting.</p>

I believe that we must establish common EU standards for colour-coding categories of waste, which would be used for sorting and recycling. It is also very important to ensure that mandatory environmental impact assessments are conducted before any decision is taken to establish or construct a new waste facility, particularly a landfill.

In overall terms, Europe’s waste is accounted for as follows: 29% from mining activities, 26% from manufacturing, 22% from construction and demolition, and 14% from urban waste. Europe therefore produces 198 million tonnes of urban waste. Since the population of the EU is 375 million, each European citizen produces 527 kg of waste each year. Despite the efforts made on recovery and recycling, landfills are still the most common solution, accounting for 54% of rubbish. The recycling and composting chain accounts for 27% of urban waste. The remaining 19% of waste is incinerated, with or without energy recovery. The problem of waste disposal is only one aspect of the issue. I feel I must emphasise that the quantity of waste that we produce is the result of our unsustainable lifestyle.

      <p sl="pt">This report has some positive elements, particularly the denouncement of abusive situations, whilst also tabling proposals intended to reduce and realise the so-called ‘waste hierarchy’. However, we would stress the mistaken perspective of almost exclusively making individuals responsible for the environmental situation we are experiencing, which is a panacea that will not resolve this systemic problem on its own, the argument being that waste management is a public responsibility for private profits; it is certainly interesting that it praises two multinationals responsible for such management in two or three Member States, without relating their extraordinary profits, or the increase in complaints throughout Europe. There is still no distinction between toxic and normal waste, which means there are no restrictions in place to control the pollution rates of large companies, on the basis of studies that consider the average waste produced per ‘individual’, putting families and businesses into the same category. Waste management is fundamental to protecting the environment and human health. However, we are not forgetting that serious environmental problems do not result from isolated acts, but rather result from the capitalist system, which does not consider the means it uses to seek maximum profit.</p>

I agree to the proposal to maintain the Daphne programme for smaller NGOs and also to the list of programme intervention in recital K containing a list of types of violence against women and children, including sexual abuse, rape, domestic violence, prostitution, trafficking and violation of women’s health and reproductive rights.

From 2014 onwards, it will be integrated into the rights and citizenship programme. As we seek a balance between administrative simplification and protecting the rights of citizens, it is quite right that the programme be assured the same level of funding as before and that the objective of combating violence against women and children be reinforced as a priority of the rights and citizenship programme, even though this is not explicitly mentioned among the specific goals in the Commission communication on the proposal for a regulation establishing the rights and citizenship programme in the 2014-2020 period. Lastly, I think that the objectives of the Daphne programme ought not to become less of a priority and that we need careful monitoring from the Commission to avoid overlap with other Community programmes so that we do not weaken a successful programme in an area in which more can and must be done.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Violence against children, young people and women still remains one of the biggest challenges to European society. Ninety-eight per cent of European citizens are aware that this problem exists, while more than two thirds of European citizens (68%) think that the European Union must take a more active involvement in preventing and tackling violence against these vulnerable groups. In addition, the spread of new forms of violence against vulnerable groups due to the expansion of access to new communications technologies demands a robust response from the European Union. Continuing the programme provides a useful tool for achieving the objectives set out by the Europe 2020 strategy for combating social exclusion and by the European Commission’s strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015.</p>

It is the only European programme which, for nearly 15 years, has aimed to combat violence towards women, children and young people. This programme covers over 500 projects, and greater cooperation from NGOs in a variety of fields, such as sexual, psychological and physical violence in institutional, school or family settings. It also includes projects dealing with the prevention of child pornography and the risks children face in surfing the Internet as well as the health needs of women who are victims of trafficking and female genital mutilation. I therefore naturally agreed with the motion for a European Parliament resolution calling on the Commission to continue funding such projects.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this European Parliament report because the Daphne programme is the only programme of its type whose goal is to combat violence against women, children and young people throughout the European Union. The Daphne programme has been a genuine success since its launch in 1997, both in terms of its popularity with stakeholders (beneficiaries, public and academic authorities, NGOs) and in terms of the effectiveness of the projects funded by the programme. It is therefore vital to ensure continued funding for the Daphne programme in order to maintain the measures currently in force and introduce new measures that will be effective in combating all types of violence against children, young people and women. Daphne is an extremely important instrument for raising the visibility of the issue of violence against women and providing the possibility for women’s organisations and other engaged stakeholders to develop their work and their concrete actions in this field. The Daphne programme will, from 2014, be incorporated into the rights and citizenship programme, but it is essential to ensure that the programme’s objectives, in particular, that of combating violence against women, are retained in the 2014-2020 period among the objectives of the new rights and citizenship programme.

Since 2007, the Daphne programme has formed part of the more general ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice programme’ and is the only programme in Europe to combat violence against the most vulnerable people in society. In fact, the objective of Daphne is to contribute to the protection of children, young people and women against all forms of violence and to attain a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion. NGOs showed a great deal of interest and involvement in the programme and submitted a far higher number of proposals than could be funded. However, the interim report of the Daphne programme 2011-2013 necessitates a few essential amendments to ensure correct application until its expiry. Greater participation from the States that joined up from 2004 and more effective dissemination of the projects’ results could also be helpful.

Projects funded under Daphne III have created associations and permanent structures which will continue to support target groups in the longer term, and which have prompted policy changes at national and EU level. I consider it important to pay particular attention to projects aimed at eradicating ´honour´ crimes and female genital mutilation. The Commission should allow the funding of national projects involving small non-profit organisations, as they play a crucial role in identifying less well-known, taboo or new problems, and in finding innovative ways to tackle them, as well as in protecting and supporting victims.</p>

However, most times, the victims of physical or verbal aggression are not bold enough to confirm this openly, which makes it difficult to compile relevant statistics.

This type of violence covers a number of serious violations of fundamental rights, such as sexual abuse, attacks on physical integrity and domestic violence, psychological violence, harassment or coercion, the trafficking of women and their exploitation for prostitution, among other examples of aggression that need to be resolutely condemned by the Member States. I condemn all violence, but especially that used against those who are more physically, socially, economically or emotionally vulnerable, such as children and often women too. That is exactly why the Member States must seek to eliminate all forms of violence against women and children, in particular, trafficking for sexual exploitation, violation of their sexual self-determination and attacks on their physical integrity.

Since there is a proposal that actions funded by this programme be included in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework as part of the future rights and citizenship programme, the report urges that the latter should include the objective of ‘combating violence against women’ and retain the same level of funding that the Daphne programme has had to date. We are bound to point out the risk that, under the new conditions just proposed, this objective is not diluted and ‘lost’ in the midst of so many others. We therefore believe that specific funding should be in place for the Daphne programme and that this funding should be greater than for the previous programmes, in view of existing needs. Given the importance that small women’s organisations, trades unions and various other NGOs have in defending and promoting women’s rights and combating the violence affecting them, we think the report needed to set out clear measures enabling these organisations to access the programme’s funds.</p>

Since it was established, the programme has thrown light on new forms of violence.

      <p sl="sk">The Daphne II and Daphne III programmes were launched in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with an average annual budget of EUR 10 million for Daphne II and EUR 16.7 million for Daphne III, which formed part of the general programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’.

In 2000, the Daphne initiative was transformed into a multiannual programme covering the period 2000-2003, and allocated funding of EUR 20 million. The programme evoked a great deal of interest, both in the European Union and in various international bodies working to stop the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The Daphne II and Daphne III programmes were launched in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with an average annual budget of EUR 10 million for Daphne II and EUR 16.7 million for Daphne III. The general objective of Daphne III is to contribute to the protection of children, young people and women against all forms of violence and to attain a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion. This is done by promoting the further development of Union policies, particularly in the fields of public health, human rights and gender equality, and by encouraging actions to protect children’s rights and to fight trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation. With this type of initiative, the EU is putting itself at the forefront of combating violence against women, children and young people.</p>

Furthermore, 26% of children and young people report physical violence in childhood. Daphne has certainly had a positive outcome: the Commission has funded 500 projects since 1997, which have managed to keep up with the times and with technological developments, for example, by funding initiatives against cyberbullying, while also focusing on lamentably long-term issues such as female genital mutilation and the prevention of sexual grooming.

One important point mentioned in the report involves the shortcomings in the gathering of data regarding violence against women: insufficient and irregularly gathered statistics prevent the acquisition of a broad overview, and this, in turn, makes it impossible to develop better solutions in combating violence against women. I voted in favour of this report and I support the idea that the Daphne programme must continue in one form or another and that its targeted financing must not be reduced.

As such, the development of this programme should take these two dimensions into account. On the one hand, it needs to be guaranteed that all the Member States will encourage or contribute to the programme; on the other, use needs to be made of the results of these NGO projects on areas like female genital mutilation, bullying and online risks to children, which could be translated into a singular portrait of the communities in which these political decisions are being implemented.

Violence against women is one of the main and most serious symptoms of discrimination, and the objective of the Daphne programme is precisely that of highlighting the issue of violence against women as well as combating it. It allows women’s organisations to carry out projects and undertake action in this field. Around 500 projects funded under the programme have made a large contribution to raising public awareness of the problem of violence. They have initiated national debate and social campaigns regarding this issue and they have contributed to individual countries undertaking legislative initiatives aimed at combating violence. For example, Belgium and Ireland have established national research centres to investigate violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First and foremost, the Daphne programme has helped to raise awareness of important issues relating to violence, and has played a role in initiating a debate on ways of combating this problem. Considering the growing popularity of online social networks in recent times, and the resulting new forms of violence, funding for the Daphne programme should be increased. It is also important to extend the group of beneficiaries of the programme to include small non-profit women’s organisations that operate at local level, and are therefore closest to the victims.</p>

Instead, in order to put effective political, legislative and cultural defences in place, we need contemporary society to be fully aware of the severity and tragic nature of this phenomenon.

I am therefore greatly concerned that the report highlights that certain Member States, including Lithuania, are very poorly represented in the Daphne programme. According to data provided by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Lithuania, 63% of Lithuanian women have experienced physical or sexual violence or a threat of such violence. The vast majority of these women stated that the experience gave them feelings of hatred and powerlessness. Of greatest concern is the fact that only 10.6% of all victims contacted the police about serious incidents. According to Lithuania’s Women’s Issues Information Centre, the police and the courts avoid domestic violence cases unless the victim has been badly beaten up or murdered. Police measures against the offender are often limited. The help given by the network of crisis centres to the victims of violence is not enough. In 2011, there were 15 crisis centres and six shelters for battered women in operation in Lithuania, but they do not cover the whole country and only two of them are funded by municipalities. This problem is too great for it to be left to NGOs. Politicians should take decisive action.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The impact of conflicts on civilians continues to be disproportionate if we take into account the variables of gender and age. The clashes taking place over the last decade have affected and continue to affect predominantly children, women and the elderly. Hunger, epidemics and violence against civilians continue to produce more victims than actual military clashes. At the same time, it is worrying that acts of violence and abuse against these groups are still regarded in some regions as legitimate instruments of military confrontation. The overall picture is even more alarming if we take into account that only 10% of the personnel in peacekeeping missions are women. Supporting the gender dimension by making the EU’s financial and institutional support conditional upon including representatives from women’s organisations in the negotiating process, as well as including a more consistent representation of women in the negotiating team, may offer appropriate strategies for achieving the objectives of the EU Plan of Action on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in Development.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am proud that the European Parliament has taken up the issue of women, peace and security, as peoples’ mentalities simply have to change. It was therefore only natural for me to support this resolution which aims to enable women to participate in full in peace negotiations and proposes to create a Special EU Representative on Women, Peace and Security. This report makes us aware that women are not only victims in the case of conflicts. They can also sometimes be key actors in peace processes. ‘Women in the military who patrol on an equal footing with men send a strong image to local women’, explained the rapporteur Norica Nicolai. It rightly considers that ‘the inclusion of more women in the prevention, mediation and resolution of conflicts’ is essential. From a gender equality perspective, more women should be included in the military, both in leadership positions and at ground level, and it is crucial to have high-ranking women officials.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The situation experienced by women in armed conflict zones is intolerable, particularly in Africa. Sexual violence against women continues to be used as a weapon of war. These crimes have disastrous physical and psychological consequences for the victims, who are often rejected by their communities. This report robustly condemns these crimes and stresses the need for national authorities to bring an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these acts and to strengthen justice systems so that they can be sentenced. It also highlights the need to promote education for the emancipation of women, and for campaigns to raise awareness of respect for women’s dignity. It also underlines the importance of increasing the number of women in peace-negotiation processes, as well as in military peace-building operations, particularly in leadership roles. Finally, it emphasises that institutional gender equality mechanisms and commitments should be put in place in post-conflict situations in which reconstruction and reintegration activities are being carried out as a first stage towards protecting and promoting women’s rights. I voted for this report for the above reasons.</p>

      <p sl="it">This report deals with an issue that is surely worthy of attention. Women and children are, without doubt, the most vulnerable people during and after wars, because they are often subject to sexual and other abuse, physical mistreatment and psychological violence. Even though the general approach is to be welcomed, since it calls for greater focus on the education and schooling of women in times of war and proposes greater commitment in the field of gynaecological and health care assistance for these vulnerable persons, the report proposes some specific measures with which I do not agree. For example, the creation of a Special EU Representative for Women, Peace and Security, with the ensuing bureaucratic and administrative apparatus, obviously carries an expense that does not seem justifiable, given the existence of an organisation within the UN that already works precisely in the field of sexual violence and armed conflicts. This is a duplication that offers no useful assurances and certainly will carry extra costs compared with today. Another problematic issue – again for budget reasons – is the proposal to open new budget items for Gender Advisors within the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this European Parliament report because sexual violence in the form of mass rapes, human trafficking and other forms of sexual abuse of women and children is still unacceptably used as a tactic of war in conflict regions around the world. In addition, the power vacuum that emerges in post-conflict areas can lead to a deterioration of the rights of women and girls, as witnessed in Libya and Egypt. The effects of wartime sexual violence, both physical (risks such as sterility, sexually transmitted diseases, etc.) and psychological, are devastating for the victims, as the latter are often stigmatised, rejected, mistreated and considered to be dishonoured, and, in many cases, are excluded from their communities or sometimes even murdered. The families of the victims are also hit particularly hard, as sexual violence is considered a humiliation. Of great concern is the fact that in most cases, the perpetrators of sexual violence go unpunished, as demonstrated by the example of Colombia, where, in a situation of armed conflict, sexual violence against women is a systematic and concealed practice and the perpetrators enjoy almost total impunity. This form of violence should therefore be viewed as a war crime. A Special EU Representative on Women, Peace and Security should be created in order to improve this situation. The creation of such a post would make policies and actions in all areas more coherent and efficient, and the United Nations would have a liaison point that would facilitate seamless cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The need to involve women in every stage, from conflict prevention and crisis management to post-conflict rehabilitation, has been increasingly highlighted during the discussions at high-level forums. Involving women in the security sector and in the peace-building process is vital to ensure the success of these efforts, and excluding women from these processes makes it impossible to provide an appropriate response to the concerns of the entire population. With regard to peace negotiations, women account for less than 8% of participants and less than 3% have been signatories of the agreements concluded. EU support for peace processes must be made conditional upon the involvement of women in the international teams conducting peace negotiations. In modern armed conflicts, around 90% of victims are civilians, with women frequently being victims of rape, used as a weapon of war, and of sexual exploitation, used as an extreme means of survival. This is why I have called for special attention to be focused on pregnant women and mothers of young children with regard to the provision of food, clothing, health care services, transportation and evacuation, in order to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, as priority areas under the Development Financing Instrument for the 2014-2020 period.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Brutality to the most vulnerable is, unfortunately, one of the stand-out characteristics of armed conflict. Despite all the international conventions on the subject, by bringing out the worst in human beings, wars demonstrate that the law is not sufficient to halt the destructive impetus and that, however much men seek to set limits on it, the hatred of the Other present in these situations ends up overcoming reason and mercy. The situation of women in armed conflict situations is particularly difficult. Psychological or physical violence – often of a sexual nature – and the multiple humiliations to which they are subjected are used as weapons for demoralising adversaries and destroying the social fabric of their homeland. This type of violence leaves deep and permanent scars, and the fact that it is so intimate instils in the communities that suffer it an inevitable desire for vengeance that is only appeased with great difficulty. The European Union should remain aware of this phenomenon, should continue robustly combating the repugnant and lamentable situations that strike defenceless women, and should seek means to help them and to raise awareness in societies of the need to change their attitude in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are constantly hearing stories of wartime human rights violations, which the available details almost always give Machiavellian features; for example, there are 16 rapes per day in the Congo conflict. Their weakness means women and children are amongst the main victims. Girls and women are often repeatedly raped in front of their impotent family members, which is hugely traumatic for husbands and sons, in addition to the physical and psychological consequences for the victims. It is, therefore, of the greatest urgency to adopt a code of conduct to be applied in war zones and refugee camps. Moreover, it is crucial that the perpetrators of such war crimes be arrested and brought to trial, so that they do not go unpunished. I am voting for this report, drafted by Ms Nicolai, which advocates protecting women from any form of violence, as well as their increased participation in military negotiation processes, which currently stands at less than 10%, since their presence is essential in dialogue with other women in conflict situations.

This report should be valued, in that it draws attention to the specific issues of women in war zones, such as, inter alia , increased vulnerability in conflict situations, sexual violence and rape. Some recommendations are made for tackling the aforementioned dangers, by preventing them, and for properly considering gender particularities in military conflicts. However, the entire report is imbued with an undisguisable militarist vision, which is quite explicit when advocating better conditions for women in the military and civilian missions undertaken by NATO. However, what was needed was the unequivocal rejection of these missions and their consequences for women, whether those taking part in the conflict directly or their civilian victims; it also needed firmly to advocate peace and peaceful conflict resolution, which is an area in which women could, in fact, make an inestimable contribution.</p>

In some cases, quotas were adopted and the number of women in representative institutions increased, but in spite of the efforts made, the participation of women in peace negotiations, with few exceptions, is still less than 10% of the formal participation. Women in the military nevertheless play an important role as role models and mediators of intercultural exchange, and are an encouraging motivation for local women, breaking down the stereotypes of local men and communicating better with local women.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In most countries, unfortunately, little importance is attached to gender equality and women’s rights because the gender issue is seen only as a minor issue, and cultural, religious and socio-economic customs are used as an excuse for hindering progress in this area.</p>

The rapporteur asks for these rapes to be considered as war crimes and for there to be no impunity for those who commit them. She is quite right. However, I seem to remember that there is a ‘law of war’, which, shocking as that term may seem, has maintained that for a long time. The rapporteur also asks for the ‘adverse effects of armed conflict on family life’ to be limited. Frankly, I do not know what to make of a remark like that. Simple naivety? Good intentions?

It may make sense to deploy more women in establishing contact with local women.

To ensure that post-war society is not designed predominantly by men, for the benefit of men and with a solely male ethos, and to ensure that the nascent social order does not perpetuate gender stereotypes, women must increasingly be involved in the regulation of military situations as negotiators, peacekeepers, higher-level military officials and other opinion leaders. In addition to increasing the participation of women in international teams, I also support the measures listed in Norica Nicolai’s report on women’s situation in war to ensure the safety of women as defenceless parties in military situations. A third but no less important point I would like to emphasise is the importance of dealing with the cases of rape perpetrated during war or their prevention; this is not merely a question of physical violence, but also of the lifelong ruinous effect of rape on the female psyche and health and on family relations.

All people should be appointed to appropriate posts according to their skills and competence, regardless of their gender.

I voted for this report because women must have an increasingly active involvement in peacekeeping operations, both at the prevention stage and in conflict mediation, particularly through occupying leading positions both within national governments and at political level. At the same time, they must also be included in civilian operations as they are much better communicators than men on the ground. Women must also be involved in the peace-building phase because, as the pillars supporting their communities, they have a much better perception of the practical needs which the peace-building projects should address. Although there has been a rise in the number of women in representative institutions, women’s participation in peace negotiations remains low at below 10% of those formally involved. The report strongly condemns the use of sexual violence against women as a weapon of war.

It should be noted that the EU already has a range of policies relating to women, to peace and to security, as well as gender taskforces and focal points relating to women and security.

The Peace and Security cluster is one of the main pillars of the strategic partnership between the European Union and the African Union. In August 2011, the European Commission decided to provide a further EUR 300 million to be used, inter alia , to finance civilian peacekeeping missions. I voted in favour of this resolution because it urges European stakeholders to coordinate our efforts more effectively to protect women during times of war.

      <p sl="pl">Firstly, in view of the mediatory skills of women, they should, amongst other things, be included in international teams leading peace negotiations and they should hold positions of leadership and positions related to management and training.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, during a war, women are at particular risk of all kinds of physical violence, particularly sexual violence. In relation to this, it is necessary to increase cooperation with and aid to national and local women’s organisations. These organisations are most aware of the degree of danger to women and can give earlier warning of such situations and take preventative action.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is crucial that the perpetrators of violence against women bear responsibility for their deeds. The perpetrators must not be left with a feeling of impunity, and the victims must not be left with the belief that they are alone in their tragedy and that no one is really helping them. In accordance with the resolution, the question of eliminating impunity should be one of the main subjects discussed at peace negotiations.

Meanwhile, a deterioration of the rights of women and girls is seen in post-conflict situations, as witnessed in Libya and Egypt. Through this vote, EU support for peace processes must be made conditional on women’s participation in the international teams leading peace negotiations.

We call on the authorities to identify and punish those who commit atrocities against women (rape, murder and infanticide) and children in conflict zones. Closer cooperation is needed with local women’s organisations in order to establish an early warning system and possibly enable them to prevent or reduce the incidence of abuse themselves.

Access to sustainable energy sources and modern energy services is a prerequisite for economic growth and social development, as well as for the realisation of several of the rights contained in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights and environmental legal instruments. In addition to that, although there is no Millennium Development Goal specifically related to energy, I strongly believe that energy should move to the forefront of the debate on eradication of poverty. For this reason, the Commission and the Member States must endorse and commit to support the UN’s recently established international target of universal energy access by 2030, and align their policies and development cooperation with this objective.

Climate change financial mechanisms have also contributed very little so far to energy access for the poor. The financial gap in the provision of universal energy access is large. The International Energy Agency states that the investment necessary for providing universal energy access by 2030 amounts to USD 756 billion, or USD 36 billion per year.

To begin to address this, in September 2010, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, launched the target of ‘universal energy access by 2030’.

In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to foster private investment for energy access. However, aside from the economies in transition, very few developing countries can demonstrate progress on scaling-up access to energy for the poor. Financial assistance for energy access for the poor has been only modest, and it is therefore necessary to increase private sector involvement.</p>

      <p sl="de">There is a fundamental link between poverty and access to modern energy supply services. It would, however, be unrealistic to assume that we can effectively combat poverty with access to energy. In this context, one might consider the privatised water supply service in developing countries, which can easily lead to a situation where the poor cannot afford water. This problem should not be ignored when it comes to electricity, which replaces conventional fuels such as gathered wood, etc. Nonetheless, improved energy supply can lead to economic growth and thus reduce poverty by creating new jobs. If we continue in the same way with the reforms in the energy sector that we have been pursuing for almost three decades now, then 67% of the population will still have no electricity by 2015. To date, progress has only been made in this regard in a small number of developing countries. Since supplying energy to the poor is not a profitable business, private investors have only improved energy supply to the productive and commercial sectors.

In developing countries, households generally spend a high percentage of their budget on the purchase of low-quality fuels for heating and cooking compared with households with access to electricity and to liquid and gas fuels. In developing countries, sustainable energy access for the poor faces a number of barriers, notably: the inability of the poor to pay for the services, investment costs, connection costs and no national capacity to produce the energy generation equipment and spare parts required.

These reduce the physical burden on women and children and give them enough time to make use of educational opportunities.

      <p sl="pt">This report tackles the issue of promoting energy access in developing countries, within the framework of EU cooperation policy. It makes some relevant observations on the scale of the problem of energy poverty and the resulting negative implications for achieving development goals. It is also important to mention the importance it gives to the need to adapt energy supply solutions to the specific conditions of developing countries, whilst emphasising decentralised solutions, renewable energy and the autonomy of these countries. If these were the report’s objectives, we would support it. All things considered, however, what ends up predominating is a completely subverted vision of the role of development cooperation, which is transformed into business opportunities for EU countries here. There is a well-known tendency to interfere in the sovereign choices of developing countries, imposing models identical to those in the EU: the deregulation and liberalisation of markets that have led to situations of exclusion from energy access in a number of countries and allowed states to be frozen out of this important strategic sector.</p>

The report focuses on the tax initiatives taken by the Commission during 2011 and on areas where further initiatives are necessary in order to improve the functioning of the single market and to create a more competitive Europe. The report also stresses that improvement of the single market and, eventually, some tax harmonisation could be key factors for encouraging growth and job creation; that tax policies must aim to foster European competitiveness and lower costs for European business, namely for small and medium enterprises. I agree with the rapporteur’s proposal that the EP should ask the Commission and Member States to cooperate further on their respective tax policies against double taxation, tax fraud and tax evasion in order to increase transparency and reduce loopholes and uncertainties for businesses and citizens with regard to tax collection. To make the taxation process more coherent, I support the EP call upon the Commission in cooperation with the European Parliament to establish an EU definition and list – taking into account, as a first step, the OECD definition and list of tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions.</p>

Tax harmonisation in Europe is the keystone for growth and competitiveness for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These barriers must be removed, especially as bureaucracy and the tax systems weigh particularly heavily on SMEs. This report shows us that these measures have led to a reduction in the tax obstacles related to cross-border operations and the elimination of distortions of competitiveness from which companies suffer, even within the European Union. This report, however, is also about preventing double non-taxation, tax fraud, tax havens and increasing tax transparency.

      <p sl="it">The report aims to declare Parliament’s faith in the proposal for fiscal harmonisation in the EU. Indeed, it is thought that the current system, based on different national tax systems, creates bureaucratic difficulties and unequal treatment of businesses, giving rise to the need to bring in a uniform tax system and give the European Union power over tax. Possible tax harmonisation is also seen as a driver of growth and jobs. I do not agree with these arguments since it is competition – including between national tax systems – that creates opportunities for businesses and workers within the common market. The diversity of the tax systems also ensures that the Member States will seek, as far as possible, to change their regulations on the subject in order to try and attract jobs and business. Instead, we should encourage fiscal federalism, which might be a tool for achieving greater economic efficiency in the EU. We should also insist on the proposal to simplify value-added tax, reduce the red tape faced by companies and introduce tax incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the underlying theme of the report, advocating tax harmonisation in the EU, I voted against it.</p>

Indeed, the current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in the Member States, and sound fiscal consolidation, together with fairer and more targeted distribution of the tax burden, is therefore necessary to ensure fiscal credibility. In this case, where the situation demands both expenditure restraint and tax increases, the most important thing is to give priority to growth-oriented tax changes. In this context, it is also particularly important not to forget that now more than ever, we have to ensure that the automatic stabilisers of the welfare state continue to operate alongside tough austerity measures in all countries in order to ensure growth and social cohesion. The European Parliament is therefore in favour of closer coordination of tax policies in the European Union, which would help reduce costs and the administrative burden on citizens and businesses, and underlines the need to simplify VAT regimes in order to eliminate double taxation and bureaucracy for employers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Mr Schmidt, concerns the annual tax report – the first published on this issue by Parliament – and is intended to complement initiatives designed to make the internal market run more smoothly and the European Union more competitive. Tax policy affects everyone and has positive and negative aspects. Obviously, paying taxes is costly to all, but states need revenue to pay for public services such as health care, education, social security, the military, the emergency services, etc. In the current crisis situation, all measures that boost economic growth should be considered. It is therefore crucial to support cross-border mobility and prevent the double taxation of the companies or citizens of one Member State that work in another, whose costs can rise by 50%. Differentiated taxation is an obstacle to mobility, so EU-level tax harmonisation is desirable. I voted for this report, since it makes an important contribution to improving European legislation on taxation, both by preventing double taxation and by combating tax evasion, thereby increasing transparency throughout the process.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report’s initial considerations are positive: for example, that the role of tax systems is to fund public services like education, health care, infrastructure and public transport, to reduce social inequalities and to ensure a fairer distribution of wealth; or that taxation is still a matter of national sovereignty and that the structures of the Member States’ tax systems should be respected. We also consider some of the considerations on small and medium-sized enterprises positive. However, the report’s few positive aspects are not enough to change an overall vision that is very negative and even profoundly contradictory with the initial considerations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this regard, the report argues that there is a need to harmonise EU tax policies and increase Commission controls on budgetary procedures, it advocates fiscal federalism and promotes the European Semester. In other words, it backs the subversion of the role of the tax system enshrined in some national constitutions, as happens in Portugal, putting it at the service of the reproduction of inequalities and of the accumulation and concentration of capital by big business and the financial sector, and justifying the rejection of the state in a series of areas of economic and social life.

EU citizens and businesses that are working and operating cross-border experience tax obstacles that are leading to significant barriers to growth and employment on the EU’s internal market, and these barriers must be removed for this reason. This is how to ensure a more competitive Europe that creates growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The current economic and financial crisis has led, however, to a significant rise in public debt in Europe and, in this context, the automatic stabilisers of the welfare state remain more relevant than ever. Effective taxation is of fundamental importance for public authorities so that they can fulfil their tasks and obligations as well as citizens’ expectations. Sound fiscal consolidation, together with fairer and more targeted distribution of the tax burden, is necessary to ensure fiscal credibility, and the reduction of debt requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, while growth-oriented tax changes must be given priority.</p>

Admittedly, a country such as France would need a real tax revolution to boost the purchasing power of its people, the dynamism of its companies, the contribution of imports to the public purse, imports which cost us thousands of jobs each year … The solution though is not tax harmonisation at European level nor the creation of new taxes at Union level, as the report recommends.

      <p sl="it">In terms of cross-border issues, the differences in the tax ‘excises’ on a number of products, such as fuel, drinks and cigarettes, can easily create cross-border competition distortions.</p>
      <p sl="it">The current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in Europe, the reduction of which requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, as well as streamlining of tax systems. Accordingly, we need to adopt measures that can make the national tax systems more favourable to common growth, ensuring that tax differences do not give business in one country an undue advantage over competitors in other countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">The current Danish Presidency has said that it is ready to concentrate its efforts on securing an agreement to amend the directive on the taxation of savings and the related agreements with Switzerland and other third countries. I must express my satisfaction on this, given a recent written question I posed to the Commission on the issue. Each Member State could recoup many millions of euro from such an agreement. This understanding could create a unique opportunity to consolidate the policy on financial markets by treating assets in line with tax legislation. Capital and earnings on capital held in Switzerland by citizens who reside in a Member State, and which have not been declared to the tax authorities, represent a little treasure trove that could instead fund initiatives for development and growth.</p>

Taxation is still a matter for national and, in some cases, local sovereignty. I should emphasise that an increase in the scrutiny of budgetary procedures by the Commission must be mirrored by better democratic scrutiny by Parliament. We call on Member States to adopt a more growth-friendly approach to taxation by improving taxation methods and shifting towards less distortionary taxes, while safeguarding the social market objective. A low tax level is essential not only for the social welfare of families and households, but also for competitiveness and creating new jobs. Improving the single market and some tax harmonisation measures could be key factors for encouraging economic growth and job creation. In this regard, we await with interest the Commission’s proposals for removing cross-border tax obstacles for EU citizens.

I agree with the rapporteur that EU competition policy has brought numerous benefits in terms of consumer welfare and has been an essential tool to eliminate obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital. I agree on the emphasis that the ongoing consolidation in the banking sector has actually increased the market share of several major financial institutions and, therefore, the Commission has to maintain a close watch on the sector in order to enhance competition in European banking markets. We, Members of European Parliament, recall the Parliament’s invitation to the Commission during the early steps of the implementation of the third energy package to closely monitor the level of competition; it also asks the Commission to intensify the efforts that it is making in order to open up competition in the credit rating agencies sector.</p>

The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the Commission responded to the eruption of the crisis in a prompt and reasonable manner by adopting special State aid rules and using competition policy as a crisis management tool. The huge amount of State aid given during the crisis in the form of, for example, guarantee schemes, recapitalisation schemes and complementary forms of liquidity support on bank funding have contributed to severe imbalances in public finances. The Commission should further investigate the competition situation in the retail sector, in particular, the consequences of alleged abuse of market power by dominant retail chains with negative consequences for small retailers and producers in the agriculture and food market.

In 2009, the nominal amount of aid to the financial sector used by Member States constituted EUR 1 107 billion, or 9.3% of EU GDP. This aid will undoubtedly continue during the crisis, and I therefore applaud the fact that the Commission has introduced a requirement applicable from 1 January 2011 onwards to submit a restructuring plan for every beneficiary of a recapitalisation or an impaired assets measure, irrespective of whether the bank is considered to be fundamentally sound or distressed. The Commission should therefore ensure the orderly restructuring of banks, with shareholder and bondholder involvement, prior to the injection of public capital. I also consider it vital for the Commission to carry out an ex post analysis of the impacts of ECB support received by the banks during the crisis and other public interventions.

      <p sl="lv">I supported the European Parliament’s resolution on the annual report on EU competition policy because I believe that it correctly points to deficiencies present in the energy market. Competition between energy producers, which would ensure the lowest possible prices for heating and electricity, is in the interests of the people of Latvia and the European Union as a whole. Unfortunately, competition in the energy market is still subject to significant limitations because the largest market participants continue to occupy dominant positions. In some Member States, such as Latvia, there is still a monopoly on the gas market. It is in the interests of Latvia’s people to end this monopoly and provide a gas supply at as low a price as possible, ensuring stable economic growth. It is therefore important for the European Parliament to continue to alert us to these deficiencies in the energy market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I wished to support Mr Schwab’s report on the annual report on EU competition policy in 2010, presented by the European Commission. We should, of course, remember that the competition policy is one of the essential tools for removing from within the EU obstacles to the four freedoms; namely, the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital. This policy also contributes to the defence of major objectives: the internal market and the consumer interest. However, Parliament especially calls on the Commission to incorporate in the regulation a detailed basis for calculating fines, along with new fining principles, and to review its fining guidelines. The size of these fines may have very damaging consequences on the survival of European companies. This is a position that I wished specifically to support.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this resolution in which Parliament urges the Commission to link the extension of the temporary State aid to the banking sector beyond 2011 with enhanced and more stringent conditions related to the reduction of the balance sheet composition and size, including a proper focus on retail lending, as well as stronger restrictions on bonuses, distribution of dividends and other crucial factors; it deems that these conditions should be explicit and should be assessed and summarised on an ex post basis by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="it">We take a positive view of the annual Commission report on competition policy 2010. I think that EU competition policy has brought numerous benefits in terms of consumer welfare and has been an essential tool in eliminating obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital. We believe that competition policy is an essential tool for preserving the single market and protecting the consumer interest, even though we think it is important to make some changes and adjustments to update a number of rules in order to deal with new challenges.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is our view that the combined effect of robust principles and flexible procedures is essential, and that this has enabled competition policy to be a constructive and stabilising factor in the EU’s financial system and in the EU’s real economy in general.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, we would emphasise that, with a view to completing the internal market, there should be greater consistency in consumer rights across the Union. We also point out that a well designed system for collective redress can contribute to consumer confidence and thus to the smooth functioning of the internal market and online trade, boosting the competitiveness of the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union has been facing a serious economic, financial and social crisis, and the European institutions have adopted various policies with a view to solving existing problems. I consider competition policy a key measure in combating the crisis, whose purpose is to create an internal market that is more dynamic, effective and competitive at international level. I am voting for this report, since I agree that there should be greater transparency in terms of the prices used by companies, that specific measures should be created to solve the banking crisis, that more research and innovation grants should be awarded to companies, and that there should be oversight of mergers. I would highlight as a positive the emphasis given in the report to fostering competition in all sectors and not just the service sector, which accounts for 70% of the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The Commission report on competition policy 2010 was fundamentally influenced by the elimination of the recent processes of the economic crisis and their consequences. Ever since, the beginning of the building of a Community competition policy has been an essential foundation of economic cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Today, we must also find a solution to market movements distorted by the crisis through appropriate regulation. The Commission attempted to respond effectively to the economic crisis, adopting rules on State aid while remaining within the framework of competition policy. I agree with the rapporteurs’ opinion that a global convergence in competition rules is also necessary.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The report covers several sectors, and among these, the call to implement the internal energy market package as soon as possible in order to realise an open and competitive single market in energy is justified. Furthermore, in order to protect the interests of consumers, it is just as important to introduce effective cost analysis at all stages of the food supply chain. The adoption of Commission rescue and restructuring guidelines for the banking sector is also inevitable, and the consideration and application of these guidelines will need to be monitored.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I agree that temporary State aid to the banking sector should be linked to more stringent conditions in the future, and I also agree with the idea of more ethical retail lending. The market distortions caused by the crisis can only be remedied through common determination at EU level. I voted in favour of the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs because I believe that competition policy is a key factor for the development of the EU into a dynamic, well-functioning and innovative internal market and for strengthening its competitiveness on the global market.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The financial and economic crisis that broke out in autumn 2008 persists, and Member States face the threat of a long-term recession. I agree with the view that protectionism and non-enforcement of competition rules will not contribute to the solving of the crisis in any way. On the contrary, a properly conceived competition policy should help to build a dynamic and innovative internal market that will successfully face global competition.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Even in times of crisis, cartels remain the most serious threat to competition, consumer welfare and the proper functioning of markets, and therefore, the imposition of fines as a means of enforcing the applicable laws is justified. I believe however, that the Commission should examine each case with great care and ensure that the amount of a fine does not irrevocably jeopardise the economic viability of the enterprise concerned, leading to its bankruptcy and liquidation and substantial job losses as a result.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The crisis situation requires that the answers to the challenges raised take account of the complex economic and social context and do not further penalise EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Competition policy is a very important crisis management tool. It has also helped to build the single market and has contributed to boosting the EU’s economic growth. Given its important contribution, a new permanent regulatory system for the application of State aid rules needs to be established with enhanced and more stringent conditions, particularly in those cases where aid is given to the banking sector. However, it is very important that State aid allocated does not distort competition but boosts entrepreneurship. Furthermore, competition policy must be pursued on the basis of a holistic approach to the internal market, with a particular focus on citizens, consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe that the Commission urgently needs to establish a European framework to address the problems of failing banks, which would allow a prompt response to difficulties that have arisen and the adoption of more effective decisions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Competition policy and strengthening the internal market need to be a priority for the EU, especially at a time of crisis like the present, when it is crucial to make the most of the potential offered to us by the Union. I also hope that the new strategy will increase the protection of cross-border transactions, especially for online products and services, and support financial inclusion. Given the highly specific nature of the various sectors, such as the financial sector, it is important to make distinctions in order to best meet individual needs. However, in doing so, I hope that the principles of competition and the free market will equally be borne in mind, as a more protected and responsible consumer needs to be able to count on the efficiencies that an open and competitive market deliver.</p>

I agree with most of the recommendations regarding competition policy made by the rapporteur, so I voted for this report.

      <p sl="pt">An economic model of free competition is crucial to the workings of the internal market. However, in order to secure it, there is a need for the public authorities to protect certain conditions fundamental to its smooth running. As such, the presentation of the annual report on EU competition policy is a singular moment for rethinking the solutions and policies adopted, identifying successes and weaknesses. In this context, the following are noteworthy, inter alia : the particular concern with State aid to certain economic sectors, which could result in increased power for some market operators, such as the banking sector; the attempt to prevent the capture of the regulator by the regulated; the need for greater price transparency; and, finally, also by way of example, the importance of removing obstacles to the competition market from the various national legal systems.</p>

The report also contains a chapter on specific sectors as well as some specific procedural demands addressed to the Commission related to its annual report on competition policy. All in all, the rapporteur made an excellent good job. In contrast with other years, he managed to limit the scope of the report and focused on specific and well-targeted assessments and demands addressed to the Commission instead of a broad and non-structured collection of general statements. Most ECON Green amendments were integrated in compromises or voted as such.</p>

During the debate on 15 December, I lauded the majority of its content whilst also warning of the risk that it would be severely compromised if it did not include aspects in relation to the collective exercise of private actions, so that the victims of competition infringements can obtain compensation for the damage caused. The approved text, with an amendment that has been co-signed by the members of the competition policy group, reflects the current consensus of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with respect to the broad guidelines that should apply to the legislative proposal for collective actions for damages due to the breach of EU legislation to defend competition, announced as part of the Commission’s work programme for 2012. As set out in my Amendment 29, these were stated in Parliament on 29 March 2009 during the White Paper debate. Coordination within the EU in terms of the right to the collective exercise of private actions will be essential for providing compensation for the damages sustained by consumers and companies, and to guarantee the efficiency of EU competition law.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We have adopted, today, the important report on the annual report on EU competition policy. This is now the 40th report, because this policy is one of the Union’s core policies and is very important for the operation of the single European market, and, as I said before during the debate, the single market is the foundation of economic success in the Union. I am pleased that the Commission, and particularly the Commission of Mr Barroso, has been very active in the area of regulating the conditions of competition in the financial markets. The work of the monitoring and supervision agencies which have been established will certainly help in bringing discipline to the financial markets. The measures taken by the European Commission with regard to the telecommunications market have also brought positive results. However, we have to be aware of the need for new regulation of the services market, and also of the energy and food markets.</p>

In fact, financial turmoil and recessionary fears have once again become acute over recent months. In such a context, competition policy may be an added value, and may become an instrument for managing the crisis. The climate is quite favourable and people are cooperative, as evidenced by the excitement characterising consumer associations that operate in the field of European competition law. This vote is a step in the direction of improved price transparency, which is essential in stimulating competition in the single market and offering real choice to consumers. The many measures to be adopted also need to include the provision of a performance scheme to guarantee transparency of service pricing.</p>

We call on the Commission to monitor the level of competition in the energy sector and issue guidelines for improving access to the energy grid for renewable energy sources. We should stress the need for competition on the roaming market and for improving price transparency, in addition to removing the differences between roaming and national tariffs by 2015. In order to ensure a level playing field across the EU, we call on the Commission and Member States to implement the Services Directive and e-government systems, thereby removing the barriers preventing the provision of cross-border services. We call on the Commission to actively monitor developments in commodity-related markets and present ambitious legislative proposals with the aim of tackling speculative practices which adversely affect European industry and distort the single market.

      <p sl="fr">To serve the general interest better, we have now been fighting for 40 years against cartels, abuses of dominant position and illegal State aid. This founding policy has allowed healthy competition between companies and now ensures that consumers can have better quality and a wider choice of products and services at more affordable prices. We must, however, continue our efforts in markets which, up to now, have been little known but which have been brought out into the light in the crisis over excessive bonuses. Consequently, I unreservedly support this report, which sets out a valid diagnosis of the ratings agencies. Their defective assessments in 2007 and their publishing errors in 2011 have aggravated the historic crisis that we are experiencing and have shown us the need to put an end to this oligopoly. In order to establish more accurate, more responsible diagnoses, we must have greater competition in the financial analysis field, whilst boosting the credibility of the small agencies. This regulation will not, in any respect, be a way for Member States to renege on their commitments to controlling spending. It is merely about ensuring that the global finance thermometer is working properly.</p>
