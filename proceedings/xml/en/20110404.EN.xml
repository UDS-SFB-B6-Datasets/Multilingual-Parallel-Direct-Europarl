      <p sl="unknown">I would like to start by making some comments and passing on some information.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 26 April, 25 years will have passed since the Chernobyl disaster, which was the most serious nuclear accident in the history of humanity. We still remember those who sacrificed their health or even their lives while battling the disaster, and also the hundreds of thousands of people who had to leave their homes. The then authorities of the former Eastern Bloc countries spent too long concealing information about the disaster from the world and, above all, from their own citizens. This made it much more difficult to take any measures to mitigate the effects of the disaster. Later, however, Chernobyl became a symbol of effective cooperation between the authorities of the countries affected by the disaster and the international community. While we remember the Chernobyl disaster today, our thoughts are also with the Japanese nation, which is struggling with the aftermath of the tsunami and the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Next comes a second piece of information, which is also a painful reminder. In several days’ time, on 10 April, a year will have passed since the Smolensk air disaster. Ninety-six people died in the disaster, including the Polish President and his wife and 18 members of the Polish Parliament. One of the members was ready to take a seat in the European Parliament, as one of 18 extra MEPs. The majority of those who died held high-ranking positions within the state. They were known personally to many present in this Chamber. I myself knew at least half of them. The reasons for the disaster are not yet entirely clear, and we are still waiting for information in this respect. At this time, we once again join those still mourning their loved ones.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The third piece of information relates to the fact that the European Parliament is alarmed at the US Supreme Court’s rejection of Troy Davis’ request that his execution be delayed, and that it be made possible for his case to be reopened. I would appeal to the relevant American authorities of the state of Georgia to make use of their right to commute the death penalty imposed on Mr Davis 20 years ago to a punishment of life imprisonment. Death can never be an expression of justice.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The next piece of information relates to the fact that we are also deeply concerned by events in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire. The presidential elections brought terror and violence to the country, instead of the peace, future and prosperity awaited by its citizens. Laurent Gbagbo must recognise the results of the elections and hand over power. We call on both sides to put an immediate stop to the use of violence against civilians. The international community must do everything in its power to stop the massacre of the population. All those guilty of crimes will be brought to justice. This is our deep conviction, and the European Parliament will do everything possible in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The final piece of information concerns the fact that, in line with my promise to keep Parliament up-to-date with the progress of investigations into the allegations of corruption against certain Members of the European Parliament, I would like to remind you that on Thursday, after a meeting of the presidents of the political groups, you received a letter from me with the latest information on this matter. We are also taking firm action with a view to drawing up a code of conduct for interest groups and lobbyists, as well as for Members of the European Parliament. During today’s meeting of the Bureau at 18:30, we will discuss this matter and decide on the next steps to be taken in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr Nicholson has asked to speak. Please take the floor, Mr Nicholson.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, could I take this moment to reflect on the murder in Northern Ireland on Saturday of a young police constable on his way to work, just a few weeks qualified to do the job. In my 22 years in this House, I have had many occasions where I have had to condemn the terrorists who carry out such atrocities. I thought that time had passed and I would never have to do so again. Our thoughts are with the family of the young man, who had a career and a great future in front of him. It was a clear and deliberate attempt to once again destabilise my region.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to make it clear that I believe that the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland do not wish to return now, or any time in the future, to what we went through in the past. The people of Omagh suffered a lot. For this to happen to them as well, I have no doubt, brings back many terrible memories. Can we send our sympathy to the family and everyone involved, on this very sad occasion for my region?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Thank you for your comments on this matter. I would like to inform Members that yesterday morning, I issued a special statement concerning this matter – a statement by the President of the European Parliament, in which I condemned this event, and, in particular, the fact that the victim was so young. I also expressed the hope that Northern Ireland will live in peace, as it has recently succeeded in doing. Members can read my statement from yesterday morning on this matter on the European Parliament’s website.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I also condemn the killing of Ronan Kerr in a bomb attack in Omagh, in my constituency, at the weekend. He was a young 25 year-old man who joined the new police service and was killed because of it. It is not just an attack on this young man and his family but on the peace process in my constituency as well. The people who killed Ronan Kerr are trying to block the progress of the peace process and we will not allow them to do so. May I thank the President of Parliament today for expressing his condolences and those of Parliament to the family. In addition, I sympathise with Ronan Kerr’s family and strongly condemn his killing.</p>

      <p sl="es">I should like to request that, while we do indeed request that this sentence be commuted, we do not say ‘to the sentence of life imprisonment’, particularly given what life imprisonment means in the United States.

      <p sl="unknown">The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 31 March 2011, pursuant to Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Tuesday</p>
      <p sl="unknown">With regard to the Fernandes report on estimates of Parliament’s revenue and expenditure for 2012, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has requested that the vote be held over to the May part-session, and thus the request relates to holding the vote over. Mrs Andreasen will present the request. Please take the floor, Mrs Andreasen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise to ask for the postponement of the vote on the Fernandes report. The reasons are straightforward and relate primarily to the paragraph of the report which covers the House of European History. The Committee on Budgets has been given conflicting, and I believe, misleading figures for this project. An example of this is the mounting annual running costs: they currently stand at EUR 13.5 million. This figure is in excess of what was originally quoted. When I had suggested that the cost would be EUR 10 million, a faceless parliamentary official accused me of lying in the press by saying my estimates were, I quote, ‘excessive’. This is not the way a Member of this House should be treated.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is worst of all, Mr President, is the clear conflict of interests in having the chairman of the Budgets Committee sitting on the board of trustees of the House of European History, even if he is not remunerated. In no other parliament would such a clear conflict of interests be tolerated. It makes an absolute mockery of the committee process.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">Until these matters are cleared up, the vote on this report must be postponed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this postponement is appropriate. It is a case of four or five weeks, simply to examine a subject which, as we just heard, involves the disbursement of millions of euro by European taxpayers. I therefore call for a vote in support of the request.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to say two things. Firstly, the Committee on Budgets has done its job and brought the draft estimate of Parliament’s 2012 budget to the point where it can be examined, debated and voted on by your Parliament, by the House, in accordance with our procedures and with what we did last year. Opinions differ among the groups. They will be able to have their say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I cannot allow Mrs Andreasen, who is fully acquainted with this matter, to say that there is a personal conflict of interest in having me, the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, sit on the board of trustees of the House of European History.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not sit on the board in a personal capacity; I am there in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Budgets, appointed by the Committee on Budgets to represent it within that body, just as the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education represents her committee within that body.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, if someone were to dispute that, I would be prepared to give up the role. Still, one must be careful not to confuse matters when using words such as ‘conflict of interest’, Mr President.</p>

I also have to say to you and to our colleagues that we should perhaps reconsider our participation in the second China-EU summit next month in Beijing if this is the direction in which things are going.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is necessary for us to have an urgent resolution on this as fast as possible so that we can increase pressure on the Chinese authorities to release Mr Ai Weiwei. The first idea was to replace the urgent resolution on Zimbabwe on Thursday by an urgent resolution on the detention of Mr Ai Weiwei, but after brief consultation, it seems there may be a better option: putting Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) on Wednesday, so that the space that is liberated on Thursday could then be used for this urgent resolution on Mr Ai Weiwei.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Guillaume, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing international protection (recast) (COM(2009)0554 – C7-0248/2009 – 2009/0165(COD)) (A7-0085/2011).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first stage will be reached this week in the recasting of the Asylum Procedures Directive. Indeed, our Parliament will be required on Wednesday to give its verdict on the revised Commission proposal on common procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This European Parliament opinion is essential to the dialogue that will be pursued with the Council in the coming months on a text that I believe is the cornerstone of the asylum package and on which – I am sorry to say – discussions are at a standstill in the Council. It will serve as a basis for a new version of this directive, which I hope will enable us to stick to our 2012 deadline for implementing common asylum rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The vote on this report coincides with the publication, last week, of a UNHCR study on the 44 industrialised nations. The study shows that, contrary to popular belief, the number of asylum seekers in rich countries has decreased overall by 40% in 10 years and by 5% in one year. Armed with such data, we need to study the root causes of this decline. Is it because of fewer push factors, or tighter migration control in some countries?</p>
      <p sl="fr">What that report also shows is that developing countries today assume the lion’s share of the responsibility for asylum, even though they do not necessarily have all the resources to do so. Europe must therefore do its fair share, and for that it must adopt clear rules. This brings me back to this text on asylum procedures and to the main challenges. Often described as a catalogue of the worst national practices, the current directive has two major disadvantages: it fails to sufficiently protect the rights of asylum seekers, and it creates major disparities in treatment within the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, major discrepancies still remain between the different asylum systems in Europe. To take just two examples, in 2009, the percentage of positive decisions at first instance in the Member States ranged from 65% to less than 1%. The time limit for lodging an appeal against a negative decision at first instance ranged from two to 30 days. There are a number of disparities, then, between the Member States, whether in terms of the grounds for accelerated procedures, or in terms of access to personal interviews or to effective remedy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact is, such disparities are incompatible with a common asylum system which ought to offer equivalent protection throughout the EU. They also run counter to one of the cornerstones of the Dublin II Regulation, which is based on the presumption that the Member States’ asylum systems are comparable. Legislative harmonisation is therefore essential to ensuring that we have fair, accessible, safe and effective procedures at long last.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since I believe they are incorrect, I should like to respond once again to some assertions made by the detractors of this text, for whom this directive ultimately amounts to little more than an increase in costs and abuses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, these procedural changes may create costs in the short term. However, a little clear-sightedness would help us see that it is, in fact, the misuse of inadequate procedures in quality and security terms that is today costing the Member States dear. I would mention two indicators to support my argument: the very large number of appeals and the length of the procedures thus generated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like us to move away from the black and white idea of asylum, where it is said to lead only to abuse. In a context in which immigration issues are being exploited, to defend asylum as a fundamental right is an obligation. Moreover, if the most reticent MEPs take anything away from the situation in the Arab world, it will be that the European Union has a responsibility to grant fair protection to victims of persecution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore support the Commission’s approach, which aims to improve the procedures at first instance – ‘front-loading’ – because high quality decisions at first instance will be particularly beneficial for victims of persecution insofar as they will enable the competent authorities to deliver robust decisions, improve the defendability of negative decisions, and thus reduce the risk of them being overturned by appeal bodies, better identify cases of unfounded or abusive applications, and reduce reception and procedural costs in the Member States, while supporting their efforts to expel asylum seekers whose applications have genuinely been rejected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I should like to say a few words about some key points that will enable us – I hope – to take this report further now. Firstly, the right to free legal assistance at first instance is, to my mind, an essential guarantee when it comes to improving the quality of decisions. Secondly, better account will be taken of vulnerable applicants, a group of people that the current directive completely overlooks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third challenge is to establish more ambitious time limits for appeals so as to strengthen the right to effective remedy, and to provide greater guarantees in the case of accelerated procedures, in particular, a reduction in their grounds or the setting of reasonable time limits. As for the safe countries concept, we call for a common European list to be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, as the Court of Justice recommended in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, the final adoption of this report should be a strong signal from Parliament to the Council and the Commission. As I see it, Parliament’s red lines have been established and the bar has been set: we are aiming at the upwards harmonisation of protection standards, and we should be delighted at that, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the vote on the Asylum Procedures Directive this week is very important. It will be a crucial step on the road towards the conclusion of the second phase of the common asylum system by 2012, in line with the EU’s commitment to the Stockholm Programme. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Sylvie Guillaume, for her outstanding commitment to this file and for the good cooperation between us. You have shown great resilience, Madam, and a deep understanding of the needs of asylum seekers and of the challenges faced by national administrations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new Asylum Procedures Directive will be the cornerstone of the Common European Asylum System. Asylum seekers must, as you said, Madam, be offered the same level of treatment wherever they apply for asylum in the European Union. Today, we know that there are lots of differences, which is, of course, very hard to understand in the same European Union with the same international conventions and the same European values.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is crucial that the common procedures are fair and efficient. They must help to prevent abuses of the asylum system, but fully respect fundamental rights. I deeply believe that these objectives can be achieved, but only if the common rules ensure the same high quality of decision by asylum authorities across the Union. The Commission proposal has been prepared in this spirit and I note with satisfaction that Mrs Guillaume and the report of the Committee on Civil Liberties generally support this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many amendments in the draft report in fact increase the level of guarantees to asylum seekers, particularly with regard to minors. Some amendments also aim to provide more flexibility for the Member States by introducing certain grounds for accelerated procedures. I find the amendment on safe country notions very ambitious. It would significantly restructure the set of rules and change practices in Member States. I also note with interest the compromise amendments on free legal assistance. This could indeed help to resolve a tricky legal issue that several Member States have mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Commission is currently preparing a modified proposal for this directive in order to give a boost to the stalled negotiations in the Council. The vote that you will take tomorrow or on Wednesday is a strategic benchmark in the negotiations. The Commission will carefully consider all Parliament’s amendments in the preparation of the modified proposal. I look forward to working together with Members on this and on the other proposals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the many talks we were able to have with the rapporteur and also with the Commissioner and shadow rapporteurs. This enabled good compromises to be reached in some areas. As Mrs Malmström just mentioned, this includes the compromise on free legal assistance, in particular, for the special protection of minors. Other achievements include the fact that we were able to agree on which applicants were particularly worthy of protection and, in our talks with one another, we were able to find a sensible compromise. Over and above that, we also found a compromise with regard to the subject of safe third countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">The aim is to fundamentally improve the quality of the administrative procedures so that there are fewer hearings in court in the second and third instance, in order to provide asylum seekers who are genuinely facing persecution with as rapid and as consistently effective assistance and protection as possible. I am strongly in favour of there being appropriate minimum standards in all Member States. Unfortunately, however, both the Commission’s text and some of the individual amendments intended to amend the Commission’s text to a certain extent do the opposite of what this good intention is striving to achieve. Many opportunities have been created to delay procedures or even to massively abuse asylum law. I will give you a few examples of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, an applicant can make three inadmissible applications and has the right to go through the full procedure three times. Only then can an accelerated procedure be carried out. A procedure cannot be accelerated if someone is clearly not recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention. In this regard, I would simply mention the subject of Tunisia and also that of economic migrants.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another example is the fact that an accelerated procedure will also not be possible if subsequent applications are made without any relevant new content. What I consider to be even more serious, however, is the subject of disappearing. If someone illegally disappears, his application can no longer be closed with a negative decision. He has to countersign the letter. Therefore, if an asylum seeker were expecting news of a negative decision, all he would need to do – if we were to adopt the motion put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – would be to refuse to accept the letter or not be there to receive it. The consequence of that would be that he could prolong the procedure indefinitely.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I speak on behalf of my group when I say that we are in a very difficult situation practically and politically, in which Member States have been talking about completing an asylum package since 1999. If there is a political imperative, then it is today, with North Africa – and the Mediterranean – in crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Talking about burden sharing should now lead to a practical and sensitive proposal. On behalf of my group, I want to say that Sylvie Guillaume has prepared – in cooperation, as Mrs Hohlmeier said, with all the shadows – a proposal which is both sensitive and effective, and really provides, as the Commissioner said, a cornerstone of the asylum package. This is why the vote on Wednesday is so vitally important. If we can repeat the majority that we achieved in committee, we can reach a position of completing an asylum package which pays attention to the many concerns and sensitivities across this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I can give you one example: I dealt with refugee cases for many years as an asylum lawyer, and I know that the enemy of good asylum procedure – fair, just, effective asylum procedure accepted by most Members States – is the lack of front-loading of asylum cases. The fact that there is poor quality decision making right across the European Union in many Member States leads to higher costs for Member States, not lower costs. So when Member States talk about the financial implications, they should understand that quality of decision making, getting it right the first time, and ensuring that the appeals procedure works effectively, is where we save money and where we are fair and just.</p>
      <p sl="en">If any Member doubts that this report is an effective, fair and just report, they should look at these procedures very carefully and understand that much work has gone into dealing with many of the potentially controversial aspects. It is also important to stress that the debate should not just be about cost: it is about harmonising practices across the EU. It is clear that standards vary too much between Member States. If we are going to continue with this kind of asylum lottery, we are not paying attention to the realities of asylum numbers going up. As we know, those asylum numbers have been plummeting for many years. Now we are in a more difficult position.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rules in the Procedures Directive cover perhaps the most complex part of the whole asylum package. That the procedure should be fair and effective can be a matter of life or death for those fleeing persecution. We have to recognise our responsibility in upholding international obligations when dealing with people seeking protection within our borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I want to congratulate the rapporteur and all the shadows for their dedicated efforts towards reaching a strong position in Parliament. Let us repeat the vote that we had in committee. Let us ensure that we send a strong signal to the Commission – but mainly to the Member States – that we are serious in this Parliament about completing the asylum package in a way that will be acceptable to many right across the House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Malmström, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely. We had very many debates. In the end, we reached some very good compromises, even though we all know that it is not always quite so easy, of course.</p>
      <p sl="de">On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, however, I would like to say that, in any case, we still have the goal of establishing a common, EU-wide asylum system by 2012. That also means that we must now make some real progress and also send a clear signal to the Council that we have not lost sight of this goal and that we are, of course, still prepared to enter into negotiations. That goes without saying. However, I also believe that we need to make it clear that, above all, we want a common asylum system. It is not acceptable, as has already been said, for it to be almost like a lottery depending on where an asylum seeker makes his application.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not acceptable – and in this regard I am pleased that, at the last minute, we achieved success here – for every individual Member State to have its own national list of what constitutes a safe third country. Either a country is safe or it is not – and then it still must be examined in each individual case whether it can, in fact, be a safe third country for the particular person who has made an application or whether, in this individual situation, it is perhaps not possible to simply say that is the case as such.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also convinced that, ultimately, the Member States will benefit from this, but so will the asylum seekers, who will have the chance, in future, to receive a ruling directly at the first instance in a fair and nevertheless rapid application procedure if this is implemented in the way that we envisage it. I believe this also to be a right; asylum is a right, not a favour. We must take an absolutely clear position on this and then also have a clear procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above all, I welcome the fact that we have managed to further extend the rights of minors. I am in favour of that and so is the ALDE Group, and I will be pleased if we get a good result in this regard tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the work that has been undertaken here on this report, under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume, is very important. As Mrs Malmström said, it is the cornerstone of the European asylum system, and it is true that there is a huge gap between the current situation and a European system. One ought, in fact, to call it an abyss, an abyss into which the rights of asylum seekers and the credibility of our protection system in Europe are sinking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we have States whose rates of positive responses at first instance range from 1-65%, when we have, in a State such as France for example, 75% of the protection decisions granted to Kosovars or Albanians being delivered on appeal, when we know that those appeals do not have suspensive effect, we gain some idea of the state of the situation and we really feel that the Council should get a move on and see that the option that has been chosen by the European Commission – and which is strengthened by the high quality report drafted under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume – namely, to improve the quality of decision making at first instance, is absolutely crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I understand it, the States that are shouting the loudest are not the ones paying, and nor are they the ones receiving the most asylum seekers. It should be remembered that Cyprus, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium receive the most asylum seekers when taken as a proportion of their population. Let us listen to those States too, then, because they can tell us what the best standards are when it comes to international protection for asylum seekers.</p>

      <p sl="en">On the whole, the result is a good text which includes significant improvements with respect to the asylum procedures currently implemented in the EU, which vary enormously from Member State to Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">To name but a few, new provisions have been introduced to ensure each applicant is provided with adequate means to substantiate his or her claims in order to reach an asylum decision within a six-month period, such as the personal interview and free advice on procedural and legal aspects in first-instance procedures, including the preparation of the necessary procedural documents.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the existing directive of 2005 on international protection is to be recast as the Reception Directive for asylum seekers. The new Reception Directive is a development of the EU’s common immigration and asylum policy as laid out under the Lisbon Treaty. The new directive is intended to set up a new system for deciding the criteria for asylum seekers: who can and cannot enter Member States and qualify for refugee status and under what conditions. It is intended to harmonise Member States’ asylum policy and give more rights and privileges to those seeking asylum.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current influx of people from North Africa is, of course, just another beneficial crisis that gives the EU another opportunity to extend its power and dominion. Immigration and asylum policy should be the sole prerogative of the independent sovereign nation state. This proposed directive is the Lisbon Treaty doing exactly what its opponents said it would do: which, of course, is why you refused to give the people of Europe a referendum on it.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my party, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), has always been absolutely clear. We have been, and will remain, against a European asylum and immigration policy. Member States can decide on such matters perfectly well themselves. The present Dutch cabinet has been the best cabinet yet, with an excellent agenda for asylum and immigration policy. As far as that is concerned, Prime Minister Rutte and Minister Leers really do not need any interference from Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My party is a party which speaks plainly. What is today’s debate actually about? International protection. We simply call it ‘asylum’. Especially at a time when we are dealing with disastrous mass immigration of non-Western immigrants, we should not be mincing words. Mr President, if it were up to Europe, we would throw all borders wide open and Europe would become a paradise for fortune seekers and profiteers, as if it were not one already. Look at Italy, look at Lampedusa. As far as Europe is concerned, all semi-criminal fortune seekers from Barbary would simply be included in the asylum procedure and would ultimately also be allowed to stay!</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, could the Commissioner explain why Europe always has to take the strain? Why are all those boats heading our way? The only and the most appropriate solution is to provide relief to these refugees in the region. Just let the African Union, the Arabic League or the terrible Organisation of the Islamic Conference resolve this. It is them we should hold responsible for arranging shelter in the region, not ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All the more perverse is the fact that, with this report, we are actually making it easier for them to enter the European Union. At the very moment that hordes of asylum seekers from Barbary are storming the European Union, we have to make asylum applications harder, not easier.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Guillaume, for her excellent and very hard work on this report, which represents a major part of the asylum package. All Member States must have fair and legally certain procedures for asylum seekers. The EU will never have a properly functioning asylum system if we do not have common minimum standards for processing applications and for the rights afforded to asylum seekers during this process. Of course, these provisions must not merely exist on paper, but must also be applied in practice in a consistent manner throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That said, I think it is most regrettable that the Commission has announced its intention to table a new, watered-down proposal that is closer to what many governments in the Council want. In view of the Commission’s position in this regard and of the mood within the Council, the vote on this report is even more important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The European Parliament must now send out a clear signal that in any event, we support the right to seek asylum and we believe that all asylum seekers deserve a fair and thorough investigation of their applications. The main method that is proposed, namely, that we should invest our resources in processing applications in the first instance, is absolutely the right thing to do and it will make matters easier for both the asylum seekers, who will be informed of the result more quickly, and the Member States, which will avoid the cost of further investigations as a result of the inadequate quality of the initial examination. There are a great many good amendments in the proposal, but I would like, in particular, to highlight one amendment which ensures that the needs of particularly vulnerable applicants are taken into account, particularly those of unaccompanied minors. The clear definition of family members that is proposed will also improve the situation for many minors in particular.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, I would like to commend the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Sylvie Guillaume. The European Union urgently needs coordinated, fair and efficient asylum procedures. The need for these can be seen in the current crisis involving refugees from the Mediterranean. Common rules are in the interest of both Member States and asylum seekers.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Ladies and gentlemen, the right to asylum is a key principle of human rights. Refugees should not be punished for crossing borders. Our fundamental task is to help all asylum seekers, to safeguard their basic human rights, and to ensure that high quality European standards are applied in considering their applications.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Unfortunately, it seems that fewer and fewer European countries are respecting the rights of asylum, or that they are receiving immigrants with increasing fear and distrust. What is happening today on the Italian island of Lampedusa is alarming. It is giving rise to the threatening and distressing feeling that refugees are not wanted in the European Union. We must show solidarity with people who are fleeing trouble spots, particularly with those fleeing Libya, who need international protection.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In light of the developments in Arab countries and in North Africa, we need to be prepared for the possibility of even more refugees arriving in the Union in the future. For that reason, too, we need to improve and coordinate procedures. That will help us make life easier both for ourselves and for the refugees. We will ease the burden of countries which currently operate more humane procedures for asylum seekers, and share the burden more fairly. Europe must not become a fortress. Asylum seekers must not become victims of our systems. I would like this report to be endorsed by a large majority on Wednesday.</p>

      <p sl="el">I too, however, shall cite an example from our experience in Greece a few months ago, during Parliament’s official asylum mission. When we arrived at the airport, we visited the detention centre, which was holding a third-country national; he was brought before us and we spoke to him.</p>
      <p sl="el">He told us that he had applied for asylum and after a while, he started to speak to us in Greek. We asked him where he had learned to speak Greek and he replied: I speak Greek because I have been working in Greece for 10 years; I went back to my country and returned and now I am applying for asylum. Let me explain: of course, we need to focus on the reliability and transparency of these procedures and to protect those who are entitled to asylum; however, we also need to watch out for abuse. There are provisions that need careful attention. I refer to a number of comments made by Mrs Hohlmeier, to which I would add this: we are saying that, after six months, the burden of proof for people being prosecuted in their country shifts to the Member State, not to the asylum seeker; this alone creates bureaucracy and may be used by some as an argument for abuse.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Commission’s effort to introduce common procedures on granting and withdrawing a unitary asylum status or additional protection through improving the harmonisation of asylum hearing instruments and improving the quality of the hearings in order to cut the number of revised decisions, however, is running into numerous objections from the Council of the European Union and from some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that the opinions of the Council and the Member States who ultimately implement the asylum hearings should be decisive for us. In my opinion, therefore, if we do not listen carefully to their comments and advice when amending the asylum system, then our work is unlikely to bring the desired effect. I therefore consider it very important to have further consultations over the prepared amendments, particularly with the relevant EU Member State bodies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, despite the influx of people from North Africa, the rapporteur clearly fears that there are too few refugees in the EU, as she calls for the definition of the family to be extended. It is apparently irrelevant whether the family members came together before or after fleeing from their country. New partners and adoptive children are also to be included in the new definition. Special protection is to be afforded to refugees with problems in relation to their gender identity, whatever the rapporteur means by that. Such wordings leave the door wide open to abuse. It is also naive to believe that asylum seekers can expect the same high level of social provision in any Member State. The European Union is made up of States with very different standards of living.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same applies to the concept of safe country of origin. If it is a democratic state based on the rule of law, it must also be classed as safe. Finally, as Tunisia and Egypt are heading in the right direction, they should probably also be classed as safe third countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, international protection is a coded and euphemistic term for asylum. The word asylum has rightly lost its glamour in the eyes of the general public. Asylum seekers who pass by, or through, safe countries are migrants of choice, not genuine refugees. People who come to Europe simply because they come from unsafe countries might be unfortunate, but Europe cannot be expected to house the entire population of every unsafe country on earth. Genuine asylum seekers should seek refuge in the first safe country; one that will be culturally, religiously and ancestrally related to them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The role of Europe and the West should not be to act as a giant reception home for the vulnerable populations of the world. Our role should be to stop creating the instability that fuels these vast population movements: there must be no more wars such as those against Iraq and Afghanistan; we must pull out of Libya before we are drawn into a ground war; we must cancel the planned conflict with Iran and we must avoid encouraging discontent in other Middle Eastern states.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as has been said many times, we have been negotiating this for a very long time and – as Mr Moraes pointed out – we have had the objective of having a joint common asylum policy since 1999.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council has made the decision to have this by 2012, and we are beginning to see an end to the deadlock that we have had for so many years. I would like to thank Parliament, because I think it has made a great contribution to this. We must have a fair, efficient and coherent system that is equivalent in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been very clear from the beginning, in my contact with the different rapporteurs on the whole package, that there would have to be some amendments. This is not something that the Commission just came up with. The deadlock is such that we need to make some compromises so that the two legislative partners in this can agree. With the vote that you will be making tomorrow or on Wednesday and with the Commission’s proposals in this, we will be in a good position to try to see if we can find some compromises. We have been involved in contacting the Council throughout the spring in order to identify the main difficulties here.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we want to achieve an agreement on the asylum package by 2012 and thus commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention – I think we all want to do that – we must be ready to make some compromises.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to begin by offering my thanks for all of the speeches – well, nearly all of them. Mrs Hohlmeier has left, but I hope that someone will tell her that I have not given up hope of convincing her that Tunisian nationals are not claiming asylum throughout the European Union and that, consequently, there is little reason for them to make a second successive claim.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to make two small points by way of conclusion, but they are nonetheless ones which I consider rather crucial. I should like to stress that the aim is not to turn the Member States against the principle of upwards harmonisation, quite the contrary. I can understand that there is some resistance and some misgivings, but I would also like them to understand that they have everything to gain by investing in proper, effective procedures at first instance. The proposed reforms are along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second key point, to conclude, is to affirm that Parliament has an important role to play. We are colegislators. The European Commission has indicated on several occasions that it wants us to play an absolutely fundamental part in the follow-up to this procedure.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I took on the task of preparing the report on the control of exports of dual-use items and technology, although I had some idea of the scope of this report, I did not realise quite how extensive it was.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report is essentially about a practice that somehow always ends up in the shadows of reports, but which, on the other hand, safeguards jobs and, in my opinion, must be regulated throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is essentially about facilitation of export licences for products that can be used for both military and civil purposes. These include everything from chemicals to nuclear fuels, weapon parts, computer components and ultimately – and we debated this very intensively – even software and software components.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, it is important that the different regulations that we currently have in the Member States are brought into closer harmony, that they are made more precise, more specific and also more transparent, and, above all, that they can attain transparency at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this report, it was probably possible to see the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon for us in the European Parliament properly for the first time. The Commission originally put this proposal to the Council in the belief that the matter would perhaps be settled by the time the Treaty of Lisbon was concluded. That was not the case, however. Thus, it has also come to the European Parliament, and I think it is good that it is being debated in this House, because we see some things, which I will now come to, in a different way to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have succeeded in overcoming certain legal complications that arose as a result of the method employed by the Commission. I would like, in particular, to thank the representatives of the Commission for the fact that we have succeeded in regulating the matter in such a way that, from a legal point of view, we are now on a safer footing. Finally, just a few key problems remain.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this House, we are essentially in agreement on everything, with one exception, and in that regard we are not in agreement with the Council, either. It concerns the question of whether exports should be authorised after they have taken place or before they take place. In this regard, it is sensible, for reasons of safety, oversight and transparency, to ensure that someone asks first before something hazardous is exported and does not retrospectively apply for authorisation after these products have already been exported, as we will then probably not be very successful in prohibiting this export. That is the familiar ex post – ex ante debate: in my opinion, it would make more sense for authorisation to be granted first and then for the products to be exported.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where we are all in agreement – although not with the Council – is on the subject of transparency in respect of the reporting obligation. I think that the European Parliament should ultimately be informed – how that is achieved from a technical point of view can be discussed – of what, where and how much has been authorised, because we are clearly the body that has to ensure that everything is carried out properly.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important for us to discuss how we should deal with exports of devices that could possibly be used in violations of human rights. I think that such exports should not be permitted. We must ensure that that is the case. I now look forward to the debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, every day, European businesses have to compete in an ever-changing and more competitive environment. The questions of dependability and timely delivery are as important as those of quality and price. Exports of dual-use items create particular challenges in this regard, as such exports are subject to authorisation requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dual-use items are not niche goods. They are very much items legitimately used in a broad variety of industrial sectors – the space industry, the telecommunications industry, aviation, the chemical industry and many others. The goods are controlled because they could also potentially be used for military purposes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many Member States make special export facilitations available to their exporters. These facilitations take the form of general licences and allow businesses in certain Member States to export dual-use items with the minimum burden.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following an analysis of these national facilitation measures, in 2008, the Commission put forward its proposal aimed at extending these national facilitations to exporters throughout the Union. The proposal for a new EU general export authorisation is designed to allow exporters in all Member States to reap the benefits of simplified export procedures for certain dual-use items to certain destinations. In this way, participation in international exhibitions and fairs will become easier. Exporting items after they have been repaired will also become simpler, and exports of telecommunications equipment and certain industrial chemicals will be simplified. On the other hand, Member States will be able to concentrate their limited resources on transactions that actually do pose a risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission regularly receives complaints from industry that certain exports are being prevented from entering one Member State while identical transactions are given a green light in other Member States. The proposal in front of you is a first step towards eliminating these inequalities within our Single Market. Many other countries are taking similar steps to prioritise their work on export control, and we should not be left behind.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, and other Members for their very constructive work on the proposal. The report presented by you and your committee is definitely a step in the right direction and is broadly consistent with the Commission’s view.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, before us we have a subject that affects trade and security to equal degrees. Dual-use items are products with two uses. That means that they can have both a civil use, as well as a perfectly sensible or downright dangerous, but in any case security-relevant, use. Some parties, for example, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, claim that these are – and I quote – ‘non-critical items’. That is incorrect. This Parliament has previously taken a more responsible position in its committees.</p>
      <p sl="de">I speak as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence. In these committees, we have taken a very clear position. We believe that it would be extremely negligent not to take certain control mechanisms into consideration. I would therefore like to appeal to my fellow Members to follow the recommendations of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence and, in particular, the recommendations of the rapporteur, who has just spoken, with regard to the question of ex ante control. This is the one major controversial issue that we still face with regard to this matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">To perform checks only after the event would result in less security. However, we want more security for EU citizens and also more security for our partner countries and trade partners. We do not want the principle of ex ante control – which the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs have followed – to now be replaced by the principle of ex post control. That would place trade interests above security interests. Many Member States, the Netherlands for example, have expressly warned against this. It would therefore undoubtedly be in the interests of our citizens for the plenary to confirm what the committees have drawn up.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the Dual-Use Regulation under debate provides for the acquisition of general authorisations for non-critical items and technologies that are exported to third countries and fulfil a dual purpose. However, these general authorisations are also intended to enable European exporters and small and medium-sized enterprises to plan reliably. This regulation is intended to represent a relaxation for our European exporters in order to spare them time-consuming individual authorisation procedures and, above all, also to enhance their competitiveness. I therefore think that detailed registration procedures and the additional requirements imposed on exporters will not result in a relaxation, but rather additional expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is no doubt that we must ensure that exports that fulfil dual purposes are also used in a safe manner and cannot present a danger, but, in any case, we also have to question the excessive and unnecessary additional expenditure. I could give the example of a medium-sized enterprise in the field of mechanical engineering that offers a 24-hour service for repairing machines and supplying machine parts. These services must also continue to be possible despite more stringent export provisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same applies in the area of cyber attacks and the involvement of stakeholders. If we do not have clear criteria and framework conditions for these areas, and if the wordings are imprecise, then I have to question the additional expenditure and the generalisation here too. Although it is extremely important to involve stakeholders in decision-making processes, this must always be done with a view to the practical and sensible implementation of the decisions. Here, too, there is no question that transparency and security are essential.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to stress once again that this regulation is intended to contribute to a facilitation of the procedure and a reduction in bureaucracy. Against the background of the safe use of products and technologies, it is intended to strengthen our European economy and simplify the associated administration.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague for the exceptional work he has done on this report, which is so technical, but which entails real implications for the security of Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union has been enforcing export control measures on dual-use items for nearly 15 years. The adoption of preventive measures such as export licensing requirements and customs registration enables the European Union to take care to avoid the proliferation of weapons, especially weapons of mass destruction. However, the European Union’s dual-use regime needs to be more transparent and democratic. A secure system must be set up where notifications about exports involving items which can be used for both civil and military purposes will be collected, transmitted and stored to prevent the danger of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also welcome the rapporteur’s proposal calling on the Dual-Use Coordination Group to submit an annual report to the European Parliament to help the latter fulfil its control function. It is the duty of the European Commission, in turn, to inform Parliament about the implementation of the regulation’s provision on setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technologies and to submit an impact study for the measures being proposed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, the European Union’s representation in international export control regimes needs to be improved. Unfortunately, the lists of items to be controlled are updated by the international regimes and transposed into European Union legislation without the European Parliament being able to participate in this process. This is why I call for better control from Parliament and for its legislative role to be facilitated, as assigned by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for time immemorial, if there is one trade that is difficult to control, it is the arms trade. There are various ways to make this control difficult. One is to trade in apparently harmless weapons or techniques that can easily become a weapon, and that is why we are concerned with dual use in the regulation. Another difficulty is the plethora of rules that make any control system ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="it">When we started working on this case, the Commission asked us to amend a regulation dating from 2000. Meanwhile, this has been revoked and we were called on to amend the more recent 2009 regulation on the basis of the same obsolete proposal. We have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the Commission, again to amend the regulation. The first request is therefore to establish clear, simple and transparent rules for European exporters having a consolidated text.</p>
      <p sl="it">Four points on the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). With regard to shipments of low value, we in the ALDE concur with the Council in being very sceptical about this system. Parliament has already limited the maximum value from EUR 5 000 to 3 000 and imposed various other criteria. The list of destination countries is very limited. This is something that small and medium-sized businesses legitimately want, but our main message is that we want security above all, as well as trade, and we must go back to work on this in the trialogue.</p>
      <p sl="it">We support the policy of ex ante notification and the obligation of registration by Member States. Finally, we demand the maximum degree of transparency to ensure that the regulation provides a mechanism which informs stakeholders, such as human rights or peace monitoring and trade unions organisations, of the various stages that made up the decision-making process, including through a report to the European Parliament</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for his work on this report and, on behalf of my group, I wish him every success in the undoubtedly difficult negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately not present at this debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to mention two aspects. The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are not helpful to the rapporteur, but undermine the negotiating position of Parliament defined in the Committee on International Trade. The amendments seek to make life easier for arms exporters. Therefore, my group will not support these amendments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I would like to state that my group has considerable problems with the use of the dual-use list to block the access of developing countries in particular to high technology. This relates, in particular, to restrictions on the export of high-performance computers. We have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual-use list, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, nuclear fuels, chemicals and computer programmes can be used for peaceful purposes, but they can also be used for military purposes. Some Member States have been supplying Libya with weapons and even with torture equipment for years. The most recent arms export report – more like a list of sins – clearly shows that Italy, Malta and Germany supplied the most weapons to Gaddafi. France, on the other hand, was the front-runner with regard to supplies to the Arab region. Others – like my country, Austria – abide by the restrictions. We must combat this imbalance.</p>
      <p sl="de">All Member States and the entire weapons industry in the EU must observe strict controls and transparency provisions. However, the system must also be kept up-to-date. Particularly with regard to software, IT and smart phones, it needs to be considered whether these will not be of benefit to democratic movements, as we have recently seen in the Arab region, of course. We therefore need more discriminating analyses with regard to the potential uses and the dubiousness of the recipients.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the number of products covered by this legislation that can be used for both civil and military purposes is far greater than we first thought. It includes everything from lorries to aeroplane jet engines and telecommunications equipment. I therefore think it is important to point out that the direct reference to the weapons industry in this regard is often misleading. It also makes this legislation important in terms of simplifying and harmonising the way in which we handle products in Europe that can be used for both civil and military purposes. It must be stringent, predictable and clear, but also harmonised. Every time I hear about a Swedish company that is denied the chance to export to another country for reasons relating to EU legislation, only to then discover that a French company, for example, is perfectly able to export the same products, it is clear that the EU has failed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must remember that trade is essentially a good thing. I am thinking of telecommunications equipment, for example, which is incredibly important for democracy movements around the world. This proposal must not make civil trade more difficult and subject to more bureaucracy. I am therefore opposed to the proposal to introduce an ex ante declaration. Modern, just-in-time delivery systems, service agreements and so on make it extremely difficult for fully legitimate products that we want to export and see more of. Most companies know exactly what these products are. Even if they apply an ex post notification, they know that they will be penalised if they export anything. I think it is important to simplify trade. We need to ensure that the legislation is stringent, clear and harmonised, but also simple. This does not fit well with having an ex ante check of everything that is exported. For example, it makes it more difficult to send important telecommunications equipment to countries that need it.</p>

Our problem concerns the fact that not all of the EU’s Member States apply the same criteria with regard to the export of dual-use items.

      <p sl="pl">I believe that this regulation should, in particular, highlight the need to prevent the unjustified and undesirable proliferation of technologies and their software, since the number of attacks involving modern technologies and software is increasing.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the topic of the report is doubly sensitive, both politically and economically. On the one hand, the EU wants to prevent dual-used goods to be used for military purposes and/or against people. On the other hand, it has to consider the economic interests of producers and users. The regulation is therefore inevitably bushy, having to cover for both existing intentional loopholes and anticipate for others in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, while for some, the regulation would appear too strong, for others it would appear too weak, requiring constant revision. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I fully support the need for a more transparent and stricter regulation. I am therefore totally in favour of authorisation before export and not vice versa. Particularly after Lisbon, Parliament can only help, and this is exactly what it is doing here and now. Consequently, its role should be strengthened, not overlooked.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, when it comes to the export authorisation for dual-use items, we are probably all agreed that we need uniform rules in the European Union so that the Member States do not all follow different practices, which would lead to distortions of competition and achieve precisely the opposite of what we actually want.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, it sounds logical when we say that exports should be authorised and approved in advance. We want more transparency and we want this to be monitored so that we can learn from it. In this regard, I would like to express my support for Mrs Köstinger, who said that we obviously need a system that is bearable for our small and medium-sized enterprises and one with which they can cope. The world market is not only for large concerns, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">That would also be my appeal to the rapporteur, namely, to ensure that the conditions and requirements laid down are also bearable for, and capable of being implemented by, our small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the problem with using civilian products and technologies for military purposes is that there is no approach to it that does not become tied up with controlling exports of what are known as ‘dual-use products and related services’. This control of exports is important, and should be carried out in a rigorous manner, which does not adversely affect developing countries’ access to the products and technologies required for their development. It is important to increase the transparency of the relevant processes and to enable democratic scrutiny of them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, there is also a need for consistency in this area between other European Union policies and the objectives of this regulation. For example, we recall the research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme, especially those being engaged in with the participation of the Israeli aerospace industry, which manufactured unmanned aircraft used in the attack on the Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009, causing the deaths of dozens of people. There is also a need for a rigorous assessment of possible dual civilian military use of the results of these programmes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of Mr De Gucht, I would again like to thank the rapporteur and his committee for the work they are doing. The Commission very much shares the views in their report and on the two remaining issues where they propose one ex ante system. The most important thing for the Commission is that it is the same system, because we have to avoid all kinds of double standards and over-complications here.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also agree with you that some kind of reporting mechanism is necessary – without, of course, posing an exaggerated burden on small and medium-sized companies in particular. However, some kind of reporting mechanism would be necessary, and I hope that you will be able to reach a conclusion with the Council on these remaining issues later.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I wanted to use the last two minutes to appeal to the Council. However, there are only empty seats where the Council is supposed to be. I am not sure whether it is sensible to conduct debates without the Council. I think it would be appropriate to inform the Council that, if it wants something from the European Parliament, it ought to come here and listen to the relevant debate in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">I know that this matter concerns a large branch of industry. It concerns a lot of items and it concerns jobs, particularly jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises which produce high technology and which are incredibly important. For them, it is extremely important that there are uniform regulations in the European Union and that we do not have a situation where – as Mr Fjellner mentioned – one country meets its obligations, but another does not, and, in the end, the ones that lose out are those that abide by the rules. That should not be the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore important for us to find a solution quickly and also for the Council to accept that not everything is as it perceives it to be. This is also important. With this realisation, we will quickly reach a solution in the interests of European industry, European jobs and the protection of human rights and the preservation of security and of freedom from injury outside the European Union. This report is intended to facilitate this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts on what is actually quite a technical report. The Commission’s proposal on tourism statistics has given us a good opportunity to revise the existing legal framework on the collection of statistical data on tourism in Europe. This is especially relevant at this time, when all eyes are on developing a strategy for European tourism policy on the back of the new EU competences in this field. Updating our tourism statistics database can, in turn, play an important role in giving policy makers a good basis for implementing successful tourism policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">For these reasons, the approach that I took, supported by our shadows, in formulating Parliament’s position, was to strongly support the aim of improving the completeness, relevance and comparability of the statistics on offer in this field, bringing the statistics more up to date with new trends in the tourism sector to reflect, for instance, the increase in Internet bookings and in short-stay trips. We are all agreed that improving the competitiveness of EU tourism is a way to keep visitors coming to Europe, so it is important that the statistics we collect keep pace with the changing nature of the sector, identifying current and potential trends in that sector and monitoring supply and demand. In this way, the statistics collected can be a useful tool for supporting the decision maker in the tourism industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the one hand, it is also important to ensure that the updated statistics are as complete as possible, giving a good overview of tourism across Europe, whilst, on the other hand, bearing in mind the need to keep the burden down for respondents. It was for that reason that I was keen to see a final agreement on incoming data collection on same-day visits, which we now have in the final agreement, as same-day visits account for a large part of tourism activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament also pushed for the regulation to cover areas of data collection which, until now, have not been thought of as relevant for tourism statistics but which we felt needed to be included as part of the recognition of tourism’s important social, economic and environmental impact. I thought that the collection of data on employment and economic expenditure – the so-called tourism satellite accounts – was particularly relevant in this regard and we pushed hard for this to be included as part of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final agreement with Council now includes a provision on drawing up pilot studies that will enable Member States to show the effects of tourism on the economy and on employment, which I hope will contribute to a better understanding of the true size and value of our tourism industry. The final agreement also sees the inclusion of pilot studies that show the effect of tourism on the environment – an interesting avenue to pursue, given the need for a sustainable tourism approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inclusion of data on accessibility to tourist accommodation for persons with reduced mobility, which was the only real sticking point that we had with Council, is also now an important inclusion. Following Parliament’s insistence on this point, Council finally backed down and agreed to its inclusion as part of the basic information collected from tourist accommodation establishments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Together with the agreements that we have reached on restricting the delegation of powers to the Commission – which I also had some concerns about – I am very pleased that first-reading agreement has been found with Council. I hope Parliament will lend its strong support to the agreement in Wednesday’s plenary vote.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in these times of austerity, the Commission is rationalising as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Simpson, as rapporteur you said that this is a technical report, and it is indeed, but nevertheless it is an important one. The purpose of the proposal from the Commission was to update and optimise the existing legal framework for European statistics on tourism. Both producers and users of tourism statistics have requested this adjustment. So the ultimate aim is to provide monthly and annual European statistics on tourism supply and demand using a common framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal is very well balanced in terms of data needs and the burden put on respondents and administrators. To achieve this, permission has been included to collect some parts of the data on an optional basis or every third year, to defer the entry into force of certain provisions to a later stage, and to exclude the smallest enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following an informal trialogue held on 12 January 2011 and further discussions, as you mentioned, rapporteur, a compromise text was agreed between Parliament and the Council. In particular, the Council agreed to an additional demand from Parliament of having the variable concerning the accessibility of tourist accommodation for persons with reduced mobility included in the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">All amendments in the report and the compromise text are acceptable to the Commission. Therefore, I would like to thank you, Mr Simpson, and the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for your constructive work on the proposal. Following fruitful cooperation between all three institutions, I believe that we have now reached our objective, which is the establishment of a common framework for the systematic development, production and dissemination of European statistics on tourism.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur for his commitment and his skills of political succinctness.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will wholeheartedly support the compromise reached with the Council. This regulation replaces the text in force since 1995, which no longer reflects today’s reality on some key issues, such as new needs and new user habits, the need for more timely data and improved comparability, and completeness of the statistical framework.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final text incorporates all the policy priorities supported by the PPE during the negotiations; in particular, a better definition of the parts of the regulation amendable by delegated acts, introduction of the definition of ‘same-day visits’, which is essential for including in the collection of statistics all those who travel within a single day, thereby also including the phenomenon of conference tourism, a better definition of the statistics to be collected, including expenditure by tourists in transit for food and drink in bars and restaurants, which represents a substantial part of our tourism industry, accepted – even if only on a voluntary basis – by the Council, and data on accessibility for people with reduced mobility. The rapporteur has already duly noted that this is a key point for the Parliamentary delegation.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, this regulation is an important element within the new European tourism strategy that all the European institutions are examining. This will permit an updated legal framework that is in step with market developments and offers a clearer and more coherent approach to collecting data on tourism, and it will also ensure more effective monitoring of the sector for a better understanding of consumer needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">I again express my thanks to Mr Simpson, the Commission for the initiative, and the Council for its excellent mediation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Brian Simpson, for this report on the EU regulation establishing a common framework for developing, producing and distributing European statistics on tourism. It is the task of Member States to collect, compile, process and transmit harmonised European statistics on tourism supply and demand. The majority of businesses in the tourism sector are small and medium-sized enterprises. Their strategic importance is not just restricted to their economic value but, above all, the considerable potential they offer in terms of job creation must also be recognised.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the Eurostat data for 2007, one European family in three could not afford to take a one-week holiday every year. The economic crisis has increased the number of European citizens vulnerable to the risk of poverty. As a result, there has been an even bigger fall in the number of those who can afford to have a weekly holiday every year. I therefore think that the tourism statistics are necessary and also relevant in terms of assessing the social aspect of this sector. Social tourism boosts the number of European tourists and helps counter the seasonal nature of tourism, reinforce the idea of European citizenship, as well as foster regional development. Social tourism statistics would enable the Commission and Member States to identify the specific needs of different social groups and devise suitable programmes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">When compiling European statistics under this regulation, national statistical authorities should also provide data on the funds used for tourism by each Member State, in particular, where EU funds are used.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I think that European tourism statistics should also include data about the staff employed, their seasonal nature, professional training and qualifications, as well as information about their current working conditions. We cannot have a high quality tourism sector without well-trained staff.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the committee Chair, Brian Simpson, for leading the work of the committee and work on the file, and, above all, for having allowed its conclusion – at least I hope so because the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) will be voting for this – and approval on first reading, and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">This task actually involves reviewing the regulation, which sets out to establish a common framework for the collection of statistics on tourism and, more specifically, for all its stages, ranging from the collection to the processing, treatment and transmission of statistics, enabling optimum knowledge of the financial world that is activated and revolves around tourism.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, it is clear that, since the 1995 directive, which is the predecessor of this directive, remarkable growth has been recorded in tourism and we must acknowledge, in particular, the great prospects that the economic system of tourism will contribute to the European economy as a whole in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="it">I worked on the file as a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group and, as I said earlier, we are going to vote in favour of it. I think the Simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts, namely, the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy, in other words, aspects relating to same-day visits, the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility, indeed the necessity, of a five-yearly report to assess the effects of statistics.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will conclude by saying that this is part of the new responsibility arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon and I think this time, we are beginning to assume the responsibilities of Parliament effectively and we will do the same with the next file being worked on, soon to arrive in this Chamber.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, it is a known fact that the European Union is the number one tourist destination in the world. Tourism accounts for 4% of GDP in the EU, 2 million undertakings are involved in it, and it pays for approximately 8 million jobs.</p>
      <p sl="el">As such, Mr Simpson’s report on the Commission’s proposal for a directive revising the legal basis for European statistics on tourism is important and comes at a crucial time for the future of tourism, given that the economic crisis and the recent military operations in the Mediterranean represent a threat to tourism and, at the same time, create conditions for diverting tourism to safe destinations in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">We call on the Commission, in addition to collating statistics, to incorporate all measures relating to tourism and the numerous tourism-related sectors, so that we can ultimately upgrade the tourism product. In Greece, tourism is a pillar of the economy, representing 7% of GDP and providing 700 000 jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in order to make sound decisions in any industry whatever, we need to be armed with as much in the way of information and statistics as possible and to ensure that regions are spending their money properly in developing a product that has such huge potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome this report. Statistics are absolutely vital. However, they are useless if we cannot compare them, and this report by Brian Simpson goes a considerable way towards ensuring that the information which is now being collected, and will be collected in the future, is easily accessible and can easily be used positively for the benefit of the industry itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the work that Mr Simpson has done and, as he has said, he has the unanimous support of the committee and quite a number of committee members are here now. I also share his concern about the quantity of the delegated acts the Commission wants to have. I would much rather see changes to the fundamentals of this framework decided under ordinary legislative procedures. We are MEPs from the different member countries, we have our finger on the pulse, we know exactly what the situation is in our Member States and, without in any way showing disrespect to the Commission, I would say that we are the people who ultimately know what the product is and what the potential is.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until 2004, we had regional development, transport and tourism all under the one heading. In 2004, those areas were divided between committees, and we now have transport and tourism in one and regional development in another.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as transport and tourism are concerned, tourism is still very much the Cinderella. It is an area of huge potential, an area that can develop into something even greater than we are talking about. Our colleague over here mentioned 4% of GDP. But if you look at it, you see, for example, that Europe is the number one destination in the world, accounting for 40% of global arrivals in 2008. Tourism represents 9.7 million jobs every year.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what we are talking about here is a mosaic of different countries, different cultures, with huge potential. We have only dipped our toe in the water; we have only started to tap its potential and we need to drive forward from here. Above all else, if we are to drive forward and develop tourism, we need the kind of report that Brian Simpson has produced and we need to work on it.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to warmly congratulate the speaker, Mr Simpson, on the agreement he has achieved in an area as technical as tourism statistics, having fought every inch of the way.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, Mr President, this is a sector in which we are talking about more than 2 million companies, many of which are, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises, providing almost 10 million jobs; a sector that is extremely labour-intensive and in which human resources, and the quality of these resources, are fundamental aspects; a sector that accounts for 5% of the European Union’s gross domestic product.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are really talking about one of the most important sectors of the European economy, given that the European Union is also the world’s number one tourist destination. In short, the Union enjoys a leading position that, until recently, has been left too much to the vagaries of the market and prevailing circumstances, with the severe inequalities and wastage that these imply.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Treaty of Lisbon has finally given us precisely the legal basis we needed for a new tourism policy in the European Union, which the European Parliament had been calling for through a range of pilot and preparatory projects.</p>
      <p sl="es">Last year’s Commission communication set out the new goals for these powers, and the need to strengthen the tourism sector through better coordination and complementarity with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">It stated that better, comparable, exhaustive, up-to-date and reliable data were needed to achieve this, and this is precisely why Mr Simpson’s report has set out these new directions and requirements. It extends the criteria for defining the great diversity of tourism, not just holiday tourism, but also social tourism, etc. It highlights the need to make accessibility for people with reduced mobility a more visible issue, includes the environmental factor, and opens the way towards taking the tourism satellite accounts into consideration in order to gain a much more reliable economic picture. It also combines new aspects and criteria, such as short day trips and data relating to the restaurant trade, which are of such importance to a tourism-focused country like Spain.</p>
      <p sl="es">All these new data will help to provide a much better understanding of this sector, which is such an intensive generator of the employment we need. These new statistics mean we will be better placed to modernise and tackle the future challenges of a sector that must form the bedrock of a large part of Europe 2020, above all, in terms of the intensive creation of jobs, which should be of good quality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we know that, if our Chair prepares a report, we will not actually have anything to say against it. He always takes a great number of things into account, and the only thing we can say is: excellent Brian, we can support that.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this case, it has been variously said that it is a technical report. That sounds so boring. I do not find it at all boring. Although it is technical, it describes tourism, which really is a very important economic objective for us in Europe. It has already been mentioned that 40% of people worldwide travel to Europe. Thus, Europe is an important region for tourism, and therefore it is, of course, vital to know why these people travel to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">If, with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, we now want to develop a new European framework, we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way. That is the purpose of this report, and it also shows the new developments, for example, in terms of same-day visits or bicycle tourism. We also want to include our industrial heritage. All of this must be included in future so that we will really know how to set our objectives. Therefore, thank you very much – it is a good report and I believe we are able to support it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I think we are all agreed on the importance of tourism. It plays a very important role not only for citizens in Europe, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Statistical data are crucially important. Only by creating a reliable and complete database will we be able to make policy that enables tourism to realise its full potential. I congratulate the rapporteur on his work, and my colleague, Mr Fidanza, has just presented the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, I would just like to raise three fairly general points. Firstly, I believe that we must make real use of the new political means afforded to us by the Treaty and create added value for the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point is that, since the various EU financial funds are, and will be, increasingly under pressure, it is very important to compare the results of the various Member States and to opt for the best practices, thereby achieving a certain degree of harmonisation where everyone gains.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third and final point is that we need to develop tourism satellite accounts, which Canada has had for years. This would enable us to determine even more effectively the repercussions for the economy, jobs, the environment and so on, and hence to respond to a number of issues in all political fields connected with tourism.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I find regrettable the complete lack of any kind of official statistics on rural tourism and agritourism, with the only data available being based on estimates. In this circumstance, I welcome the actions envisaged by the European Commission aimed at increasing the socio-economic knowledge base for tourism. I also wish to emphasise the importance of the ‘ICT and tourism’ platform proposed by the Commission. However, I think that efforts need to be stepped up to equip rural areas with a state-of-the-art IT infrastructure, for instance, by providing broadband Internet.</p>
      <p sl="ro">More than 500 000 accommodation establishments are involved in rural tourism and agritourism, offering more than 6 million beds. Both these sectors have seen average annual growth of 10-15% in recent years, thereby making a vital contribution to improving the quality of life in rural areas and to the diversification of the rural economy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, all I wanted to do was to slightly contradict what Mr Leichtfried has said to spice up the debate a little.</p>
      <p sl="es">I understand Mr Leichtfried as saying that tourism causes transport problems. I believe, in fact, that what transport does is to improve and promote tourism and that, therefore, just now when we are reviewing the trans-European transport networks in Europe, we should bear this very much in mind, as there is evidence that better, smoother running transport, with greater capacity and less environmental impact, is a key element for the tourist sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore hope that, in the future, the funding of the trans-European networks, and the data that we receive from this, will also improve the capacity of the tourism sector in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it would be nice if questions regarding the reasons for success as a tourist destination – in other words, why one destination is in demand whereas others are seeing a fall in visitor numbers – could be answered using informative statistics. However, that is a wish that will probably not be fulfilled. Too many uncertain factors, such as particular weather conditions, turn tourism predictions into a game of chance.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not even possible to say with certainty whether the opening of new flight connections is increasing the number of overnight stays or whether, on the contrary, new flight connections are a result of increasing demand on the part of travellers. However, the limited availability and comparability of tourism data is also a problem from the point of view of town planning. At the end of the day, if a potential increase in visitor numbers is forthcoming, it is important to organise this in such a way as to avoid it having a negative impact on the local population.</p>
      <p sl="de">Flexible working hours and safety influence tourism just as much as social changes. The decisive factors, however, will probably ultimately be the global economy and perhaps the price of oil. Even the best European tourism statistics can do little to change these.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Mr Simpson’s report is an important milestone as regards the European statistical framework for tourism. Given its high potential, tourism therefore contributes to employment and economic growth. The efficiency in processing the data and comparability of the statistics supplied need to be improved.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With the aim of tackling the global competition in the tourism sector, Romania has devised for itself in a professional manner a strategy which makes it stand out from other tourist destinations in the world. The strategy is based on Romania’s branding as a country, which is a concept we are using to present to prospective tourists the authentic nature of our traditions and the wonderful landscapes we have.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should emphasise that developing tourism could also help reduce inequalities in the regions of south-eastern Europe. The focus must therefore be on diversity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to point out that, unfortunately, the European Parliament very rarely concerns itself with matters relating to tourism. Upon closer examination, the work of the Committee on Transport and Tourism can be seen to consist of matters relating to transport 95% of the time, and those relating to tourism only 5% of the time. Although I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Simpson’s report, I have one request: if we wish to discuss statistics, it is very important to compare things which are comparable. The next stage of our work should be to adopt standards in individual areas, for example, in the case of hotels. If a hotel has two, three or four stars, this must be very clearly formulated.</p>

It will also be possible to put up a robust, analytical framework so that we are capable of making informed policy decisions regarding all the aspects of tourism that have been mentioned here today and many more besides. As tourism develops, we must also, of course, catch up with the statistics.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I listened with interest to what the Members said. I particularly want to take up the point that was raised about the fact that, while it is a Transport and Tourism Committee, only about five per cent of our workload concerns the tourism sector. This is true in some respects, but it is not because this Parliament does not want to do more work on the tourism sector: it is because the Council and the Member States will not let us do any more work on the tourism sector. So if there is blame to be laid in that regard, it should be laid fairly and squarely at the door of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this report, we have a framework that will give us the data required to help practitioners – those at the coalface – plan and develop our tourism product here in the European Union. We have a very diverse tourism industry – from beautiful natural areas to sunshine beaches to our rich industrial and cultural heritage – and Members know how much industrial heritage is close to my heart.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe has a lot to offer visitors, be they from outside or from inside the European Union. I think that, by getting this report together, it gives us the opportunity to plan to provide a fantastic product for people to come and see and enjoy during their leisure time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank all the colleagues and the Commission for their hard work and their kind words. Such cooperation makes the life of a rapporteur a lot easier. I am not sure about it being exquisite: this is not a word usually associated with me, but I will accept it.

      <p sl="it">Tourism is an important economic activity of the Union, with great potential for contributing to the creation of jobs and economic growth. With about 1.8 million small and medium-sized enterprises, the estimated contribution of the tourism industry to European GDP in the EU is more than 5%. The system of tourism statistics is currently regulated by Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical data in this sector. I believe that statistics are not only helpful for monitoring specific policies for tourism, but may be useful in the broader context of regional policy and sustainable development. In recent decades, the sector has been facing major challenges such as increasing global competition, demographic trends, environmental constraints, the seasonal distribution of tourist movements and the increasingly frequent use of new information and communication technologies by customers. In acknowledging the crucial role of statistics in the development of more effective tourism policies at European, national, regional and local level, I believe that the overall objective should be to strengthen the EU tourism sector through action coordinated at Union level to complement the efforts of individual Member States</p>

      <p sl="lt">European tourism has recently experienced a difficult economic situation, and this was aggravated by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland last year, because the interruption of air traffic due to the presence of volcanic ash clouds had a major effect on travel in Europe, causing significant disruption to airlines, travel agencies and tour operators as well as tourists themselves. It is therefore very important to improve and define a new policy framework for tourism in Europe. Furthermore, this sector is facing increasing difficulties and new challenges, such as competition, demographic trends, climate change and environmental constraints, and the seasonal distribution of tourist movements, which need to be addressed at both European Union and Member State levels. It is important to draw attention to the fact that tourism is a major economic activity with a broadly positive impact on economic growth and employment in Europe. Consequently, it is necessary to update and optimise the legal framework for European statistics on tourism, and we should strengthen the EU tourism sector through specific proposals and initiatives that would complement Member State programmes. Tourism is also an increasingly important aspect in the lives of European citizens, more and more of whom are travelling, either for leisure or business. Furthermore, this sector impinges on cultural and natural heritage and on traditions and contemporary cultures in the European Union. Consequently, it is important to define a new framework for action to increase its competitiveness and its capacity for sustainable growth.</p>

Tartan Day is a day of celebration where Scotland reaches out to our diaspora in North America and encourages our North American friends to come and visit us. It falls on the anniversary of the signing of Scotland’s independence declaration, the Declaration of Arbroath. That centuries-old document sums up well the principles upon which all my work here is guided: ‘It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom – for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself’.</p>

      <p sl="ro">There is ever-growing talk at the moment about increasing the EU’s global competitiveness; tourism is one of the most important socio-economic activities, generating approximately 5% of the European Union’s GDP. To ensure the development of a sustainable, responsible, high quality tourism sector, it is absolutely necessary to update and improve the legal framework for European statistics in this area. If we improve the quality of statistical reporting, based on reliable, comparative data, we will benefit from a solid foundation when it comes to making decisions on devising EU financial policies and instruments.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that we must do our utmost to remain the number one tourist destination in the world. To achieve this, we need to make maximum use of every possible funding option. In this regard, I call on the European executive to develop and mobilise instruments and programmes providing EU support which are specially tailored to the development of tourism in Europe, in keeping with the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I believe that the current system for collecting tourism statistics is not consistent with the new requirements we face, or with the rapidly developing tourist services market or the fact that tourists’ habits are changing. It is therefore right that the report should take into account features such as short breaks or the use of the Internet to book trips. The updating and optimisation of the legal framework for the collection of statistical data in the field of tourism in the EU is extremely important in this respect. Tourism statistics and social and economic indicators illustrate the influence of tourism on the current state of the European economy. It is also vital to propose the insertion of a provision imposing an obligation to collect data regarding the accessibility of the tourist infrastructure to persons with reduced mobility.</p>

European statistics in this field, together with concern for environmental protection, can play a key role in planning a European strategy in this area. Reliable data which have been properly processed are essential in order to plan a framework of action in such a way as to maximise profit and to manage environmental threats. I believe that one of the matters we focus upon should be the collection of data on the development and current state of agritourism and ecotourism. A pan-European exchange of best practices is also essential for the dynamic development of this unique sector. In order to meet our expectations, European decision makers and entrepreneurs need up-to-date and reliable data, which take technological changes and new trends in consumer behaviour into account. It should be noted that the Treaty of Lisbon assigned new powers to the European Parliament with a view to stimulating measures in this field, as a result of which Parliament has a say in the revision of legal standards regulating this sector. I hope that this will help ensure that work on a sustainable tourism strategy progresses constructively.</p>

      <p sl="fr">With the Treaty of Lisbon, tourism has become a Community responsibility in its own right, and we must therefore take control of this matter. This proposal for a regulation enables us to update tools to improve the visibility and strengthen the appeal of Europe as a tourist destination of excellence. By developing tourism, whether for business or pleasure, we are helping to revive and support growth and to create employment. We will thus have reliable and effective databases, for use by the public authorities and professionals in the sector, which will enable us to adapt tourist services to tourists’ expectations, at a time when consumption patterns have changed and evolved and when competition is becoming ever stronger in this economically attractive, job-creating industry. This will give us precise and valuable information for the discussions we will have and for the guidelines we will set on European tourism policy. For these reasons, I supported this proposal.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a new EU policy framework to fight violence against women (2010/2209(INI) (A7-0065/2011)).</p>
    </intervention>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs and my colleagues in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their strong commitment to fighting violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Ahead of the vote tomorrow, and in order to initiate the debate, I could have mentioned the number of women affected and how many women have been murdered as a result of this deadly violence. I am not going to do that, but I will try to convey a few images of this violence ahead of the vote, so that all Members know that they have an opportunity to fight this violence right now by voting yes to the report tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Imagine a mother sitting with her children and reading them a good-night story. Suddenly, the door is jerked open and her husband, the children’s father, is standing in the doorway. Both she and the children know immediately what is going to happen. The children draw the covers over their heads, putting their fingers in their ears and closing their eyes, trying to shut out what they know will happen. They hear their father shouting, they hear him kicking and striking their mother and they hear their mother’s groans. That is one picture of this violence.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Here is another picture. A woman who has lived for a number of years with threats, insults and abuse finally decides to leave the relationship to build a new life for herself and her children. She flees and is lucky to find sheltered accommodation. After a few days, she leaves her children at the day nursery. The man is waiting outside and stabs the woman with a knife – she dies. Yet another victim of the deadly violence that affects women. This is a type of violence that is inflicted on women precisely because we are women. The lethal violence against women illustrated by that last image occurs when the woman has finally decided to leave the relationship. The most dangerous thing a woman can do is to ask for a divorce from a man who believes that he owns her. She is in a very dangerous situation when the man realises that he is about to lose control and power over her.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Here are some more images. A young girl is on her way home after a trip to the cinema. She says goodbye to her friend and calls out ‘See you tomorrow’. She still has a little way to go. She hears heavy steps behind her, but only has time to register the fact that someone is following her. She is attacked and raped. She survives, but has to live with this for the rest of her life.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Other problems that we have to face include genital mutilation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In its action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, the Commission stated that during the period 2011-2012 it will issue a communication on this violence and that the communication is to be followed up by an EU action plan. I welcome this and look forward to this action plan.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As long as women are affected by gender-based violence – just because we are women – we will not be able to call our society an equal society. Women’s lives and their various life choices are restricted by this violence and by the awareness of how widespread it is in society.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Women are victims of gender-based violence, but I would also like to finish by saying that sometimes, we have to stop viewing these women simply as victims. These are often strong women who, with well-functioning social support, manage to build a good life for themselves and for their children. It is now up to us in the European Parliament to show that we support these women.</p>

    <intervention id="1-119-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much, Mrs Svensson, for your very moving introduction on this extremely important subject. Combating violence against women is a very high priority for the Commission, as is shown by the gender equality strategy. There is still, as you show, a very big problem of violence against women in Europe, and for that reason, we are working on focused actions to address this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will develop a clear and coherent policy response to tackle this problem in Europe. I welcome your report, Mrs Svensson, and I welcome this important initiative; it provides the possibility to cooperate, exchange views and create synergies between what the Commission is doing and what the European Parliament is doing in order to define future action in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of points that you raise in the report are actually covered by ongoing and planned actions of the Commission on combating violence against women. To maximise our impact, we are focusing on concrete actions in an area where we have a clear legal basis to act in the Lisbon Treaty. In the forthcoming victims’ rights package, we will, notably, address the protection of particularly vulnerable victims such as women, but also children. This package will be presented next month.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every victim of crime needs assistance in the aftermath of a crime and to cope with any proceedings that follow. Women are, of course, particularly vulnerable if they have suffered violence in their home – rape or sexual abuse, stalking or other kinds of gender-based violence. They need to be treated with respect and knowledge when they come into contact with people and the justice system. These women also need specialised support and protection and should be given access to justice and compensation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current legal framework in the EU does not provide for a minimum level of treatment for victims throughout the EU irrespective of where they have been victimised, and that is why the Commission intends to act to strengthen the position of victims in Europe. We are thus presenting, as a first step, a package of legislative measures on the rights, protection and support of victims of crime and the mutual recognition of protection measures. Specific focus in this will be given to vulnerable victims such as victims of sexual and domestic violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will also provide for the mutual recognition of protection measures, which will benefit especially victims suffering repeated violence from a spouse, partner or member of their close family. With this package, the Commission will make sure that in Europe, no woman crossing the borders and benefiting from a protection measure – be it of an administrative, civil or criminal nature – is left behind.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our package will set out a general framework, which would then be completed in the course of this mandate by other instruments focusing on the specific needs of certain types of victims. For instance, the Commission is concerning taking stronger action to combat female genital mutilation, as you also mention in your report.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel with our actions in the criminal justice area, we will work for the empowerment of women, awareness-raising and the collection and analysis of statistics on violence against women. The Commission will draw on the work by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which will collect and analyse data and statistics on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to underline that the Commission is currently providing important financial support to prevent and combat violence against women, particularly through the DAPHNE III Programme, the work of European NGOs and public authorities.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, on most occasions that I have spoken in Parliament, it has been to denounce violence against women, and I am here again to combat it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must say that not only do I not tire of doing this, but I think that it is essential to continue to speak out in public about this violation of human rights, as you cannot defend a cause without a sounding board. Furthermore, this Parliament is the best loudspeaker available to me to defend all those women who suffer daily from abuse and who need us, as legislators, to compel the Member States to punish the perpetrators of this aggression in a manner that befits the seriousness of the crime, and also to provide assistance to the victims.</p>
      <p sl="es">When, according to estimates, one in four women in Europe has suffered gender violence at least once in her life, and the same proportion of children, I believe that we cannot but demand greater commitment, as has been recognised by the Commission in its action plan. I believe that we must keep on insisting, time and time again, in order to protect victims, as we did with the European Protection Order, for which I was rapporteur, and I hope that it will come into effect as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">This report has benefited from a great measure of consensus and support from the outset. This shows that when we tackle domestic violence, which affects all family members, including children, the elderly, women and men, this should not provide the opportunity for political opportunism, as it does us all great credit to be making progress towards finding a solution to this scourge of our society.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first thing we must do is to speak up, and the second is to get down to work, for, although we have spent decades speaking about gender violence, we have not managed to reduce the number of deaths. We must be doing something wrong, and therefore, it is time to leave demagogy aside and to move from words to actions. We must give more genuine assistance and apply the legislation that women need if they are to live in dignity and safety.</p>
      <p sl="es">I want all the victims to know that I shall always be here to speak up for them, until the day that, by working together, we manage to defeat this terrible enemy, which sadly ends the lives of so many innocent victims.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, one in four European women are victims of violence. More than one in 10 women are victims of sexual attacks, and our children also suffer violence. Twenty six percent of children report having suffered physical violence during their childhood.</p>
      <p sl="da">These figures show that Europe has a serious problem that requires action. We can no longer turn a blind eye to this, and I simply cannot bear to hear any more stories of women who have had acid thrown in their faces by their husbands or boyfriends, or of women who are disfigured and mutilated. I have heard the most heart-rending stories from many women, and every one of these stories is also a shameful blot on the EU’s history.</p>
      <p sl="da">The EU needs to act now and stop this violence. That is why this report on violence against women that we are debating today is so important. We are sending a signal to the outside world that the European Parliament considers gender-related violence to be a violation of fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="da">Therefore, the Commission must respond now. We need a directive, we want a directive that will stop violence against women. Putting a stop to violence will require a coordinated and multi-faceted effort. We need to secure the safety of the victims and provide them with the best possible protection, while also ensuring that there is nowhere in Europe where it is possible to avoid punishment for being violent towards women, and, most important of all, we must, of course, make a huge effort with regard to prevention. Violence is not a private matter. We can only end this violence by taking action from a political standpoint.</p>

      <p sl="de">Thank you Mr President. Let me first thank the rapporteur for the great work accomplished and all my colleagues for their determination not to give up fighting gender-based violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report shows that the European Parliament considers that immediate action to combat violence against women is not only necessary but urgently needed. The Commission must acknowledge that all arguments point to the fact that EU-wide measures and instruments have to be introduced. We know that, throughout the Union, huge discrepancies exist in Member States’ legislation to combat violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last year, a feasibility study by the Directorate-General for Justice found differences in access to protection orders, the availability of support services and the expertise and capacity of the responsible public servants. We have seen signs of commitment towards the eradication of all forms of violence and an efficient policy framework at EU level, notably within the Women’s Charter which you presented last year, and the communication on the implementation of the Stockholm Programme. Nevertheless, many Member States have failed in implementing efficient legislation to protect women from all forms of violence and discrimination, and we are now seeing that the core values of our Union do not apply to half its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we now call on the Commission to come up with a dedicated legislative proposal. A set of minimum requirements must be drawn up and incorporated into a legislative act which should be part of a comprehensive strategy addressing all forms of gender-based violence. This strategy and policy initiative should also be complemented by broad awareness-raising activities. I am thinking, in particular, about a European year on combating all forms of violence against women, for which we are currently collecting citizens’ signatures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, having regained our founding principles laid down in the Treaty, and the commitment from your side which has already been stated, we expect today a clear answer on how and when the Commission intends to propose effective measures at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am happy that combating gender-based violence is a priority of both the European Commission and the European Parliament. That gives us a common goal to make real progress in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope this report will be considered an important contribution to the victims’ package that the Commission has promised us, and that the victims’ package will, in turn, be one of the aspects of a Europe-wide comprehensive strategy that includes victim support, but also other aspects of the struggle against violence. For instance, we need a minimum level of assistance services. Every woman should have access to shelters, to free legal aid and to psychological aid. For example, we need to protect migrant women who do not have an independent residence permit and are extra vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report includes many important aspects and we, as Greens, hope that we can vote in favour of it. But if recital J and paragraph 19 stay in, which call prostitution a violation of human rights without even distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary prostitution, we will have to abstain. I hope it does not go that far and that we can have a strong and widely-supported report to offer to the Commission and to the Member States as our contribution.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I welcome this own-initiative report of the European Parliament, and I take the view that Member States must introduce the laws which are essential for stopping violence against women. Domestic violence is a very serious form of violence against women. Domestic violence is not a private family matter. The European Conservatives and Reformists are committed to supporting the family and, above all, children. The problem of domestic violence is related to this. Domestic violence has disastrous consequences for all family members, particularly children. Children who repeatedly witness domestic violence often accept violence as a normal form of behaviour. There is a strong likelihood that they themselves will commit these acts in school or later on in life.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Violence against women, in my opinion, also reflects and reinforces inequalities between men and women, and therefore often determines the position of women in society. Women who are exposed to domestic violence commonly become economically dependent and are exposed to psychological pressure from the perpetrator. We must pay due attention to domestic violence in order to bring it out into the open and help the victims, who are women and children. We must therefore raise awareness of the occurrence of this form of violence. We need to have a social debate on this issue, and we need to mount a prevention and awareness campaign, as women often do not like to speak openly about their traumatic experiences, out of fear for themselves and their children. In connection with this, I also support the introduction of the European Protection Order, which, among other things, may help victims of domestic violence at the European level, as long as it has a sound legal basis.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this is an important report that proposes a new global political approach against gender-based violence, with concrete measures including, in particular, criminal proceedings and preventive and protective action, drawing attention to the need to guarantee conditions for the emancipation of women, while also combating insecure work, unemployment and poverty, so that women can choose their lifestyles freely. Unfortunately, women are currently unable to make this choice and are often forced into situations of dependency, including prostitution and submission to acts of domestic violence that would otherwise be unacceptable to them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore time to move from words to actions in order to put an end to this violence, which is clearly one of the most serious forms of human rights violation. This gender-specific violence, which also has a strong negative impact on children, and tends to worsen during periods of economic and social crisis, can no longer be accepted. That is why we are calling on the Commission, as well as on the Member States, to take concrete measures as soon as possible in defence of women’s rights and against violence.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, combating all forms of violence against women is a priority for the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore call for long-term political, social and legal measures to do away with gender-based violence and to achieve true equality between the sexes. I have been sponsoring, along with other colleagues in this House, the establishment of a ‘European year of combating violence against women’ in order to raise awareness among European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the European Commission’s acknowledgement in the 2010-2015 Action Plan of the need to combat gender-based violence by all means is a significant step which must be translated into specific actions. We still await the strategic plan that the European Commission announced it would be presenting this year. This plan should introduce a package of legal measures and practices to ensure victims of violence are offered adequate protection by national criminal justice systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Europe, it is estimated that between 20 and 25% of women have suffered violence at least once in their lifetime. Moreover, it is estimated that half a million women living in Europe have undergone female genital mutilation. These statistics, which are unfortunately on the rise, are certainly alarming and worrying and require prompt action by European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Violence against women has negative consequences on the entire family. Mothers can no longer instil a sense of security in their children and children become indirect victims of violence. Violence against women is a phenomenon that is very difficult to monitor, because often the women who are its victims are ashamed and are afraid to report the violence to the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">This makes the work of the institutions more difficult yet, at the same time, necessary. So I join my colleague, Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, in saying, ‘stop violence against women, stop it immediately!’</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur, I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report, which deserves my group’s support. It has already been said that violence against women represents a serious attack on human rights; a serious violation of human rights. We know that victims of violence are obliged to forego many of their fundamental rights, and that they are vulnerable to further abuse.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Not long ago, I visited a shelter in my country, Portugal, and spoke to a number of these women. Some described a life of suffering, and it was only because their children put pressure on them that they had the courage to report their attackers. Others described how their children, now grown up, filed charges, because the women themselves did not have the courage to do so. It is unacceptable that they, the victims, should have to leave their homes, taking their children out of the family environment, while the aggressors remain at home.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that we need to change legislation so that women are respected and so that women do not continue to be victims of violence; victims of situations that have an adverse effect on all of us. I would also like to say that this is an attack on democracy itself, too, as these women are being deprived of their rights as citizens. Let us therefore combat this scourge together.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, when discussing how to combat violence against women, we mainly think about violence within families or in personal relationships. It goes without saying that this type of violence constitutes a serious wrongdoing, and the Member States should take firm legal measures to fight it. I agree with the spirit of the Svensson report in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However I would like to take the opportunity of this debate to highlight a different type of violence not infrequently experienced by women. I am talking about state-imposed violence, entailing removing children from their mothers, which is happening with increasing frequency. Taking away a child is the worst possible violence that can be inflicted on a mother, and this sometimes happens for entirely trivial reasons. I know of dramatic examples in Poland of children being taken away from their mothers, including one case in which a family court removed a 10 year-old boy from his mother because the mother was accused of praying too much. There are situations in which children are removed because the parents are poor. Instead of helping the family, the children are taken away to a foster family or taken into care. There are also dramatic cases in which children are taken from their mothers due to disputes between the parents. Dramatic scenes sometimes ensue when children are taken from their mothers by the police, social workers or court officials.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The value of the family is depreciating in Europe, and the state is interfering more and more in family life. This not infrequently results in state-sanctioned violence which harms parents and which, above all, harms children. Taking children from their mothers, and taking mothers from their children – for there are two sides to the matter – should be a final resort for when the child is being abused or suffering violence. Children should not, under any circumstances, be taken away because of poverty. Families and women in families should be given comprehensive support, and we should avoid breaking family ties, because this is not infrequently a medicine worse than the malady.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament will adopt a report during this part-session which sets out a multi-faceted approach to violence against women. I believe that employing such a broad definition of violence against women will help in the fight against this problem. There can be no doubt that tangible results will only be achieved if integrated measures are taken at various levels – political, social, legal and educational. Nevertheless, we are still waiting for a proposal for a directive which is focused exclusively on combating violence, and I hope that the European Commission will put forward a proposal of this kind in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to conclude with two more comments. It is of the utmost importance that violence against women should finally be perceived as wrongdoing, and not only from the perspective of the women themselves, or the social unit of the family, but also that we should be aware of the attendant costs which are borne by society as a whole, as is happening ever more frequently. Secondly, during our debate on this problem, we should not concentrate solely on combating violence, but also on the various dimensions of such behaviour. We should fight stereotypes and condemn social acceptance of violence against women, and try to change the way in which children are brought up so that future generations of young people believe in genuine equality between women and men and put it into practice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to congratulate Mrs Svensson on her report, which raises an extremely important and sensitive issue for society, namely, violence against women. I believe that today’s words will be followed by actions, and that we will not only talk about violence against women but, above all, take action to defend women. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in the Stockholm Programme, the Commission indicated that it would use all possible means to combat violence against women. There is, however, no comprehensive strategy at the moment, and yet we need to act urgently.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Safety is an important commodity, especially for the most vulnerable amongst us. This also applies to a large group of women who are still subject to forced marriages, honour killings and genital mutilation. These harmful traditional practices affect many girls and women in Europe on a daily basis. We need adequate resources to tackle this kind of violence. To that end, we need investigations and we need to pay special attention to the victims of such practices.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, the Commission needs to set up a European strategy as soon as possible in order to combat violence against women, a strategy which will address traditional harmful practices, in particular. Today, rather than tomorrow, and not just in 2012 or 2013. It is therefore unacceptable that an important instrument such as the European Protection Order has still not come about. Somebody’s safety cannot and should not stop at the border.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, following on from comments made by previous speakers and from the Svensson report itself, we should, first and foremost, emphasise once again that violence against women is still a feature of our society. One of the main reasons why this phenomenon has persisted is the inferior material status of women and economic discrimination against them during their career, more restricted access to the labour market, lower pay and fewer social security benefits. It is women who accept the consequences of motherhood and who bear the burden of bringing up children. Social security in this respect is insufficient in many European countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During women’s working lives and, in particular, when they have retired, these factors mean that they are reliant on the goodwill of their spouse and social security systems. This is a grossly unfair situation, and it must meet with universal opposition. This is why it is so important to propose that women be paid in full for the time they devote to motherhood and bringing up children. This is particularly important today, at a time of demographic crisis in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Measures to ensure equal economic opportunities for women may help to eliminate or reduce violence against them. The economic dependence of women on men is one of the many reasons for women’s passivity, submissiveness and also, in a certain sense, their consent to the phenomenon of violence. It is high time to put an end to this. The European Parliament has far-reaching opportunities to improve this situation, particularly in countries where women are in a particularly difficult situation due to widespread poverty. This is a very important message, and I am grateful to those who initiated this report for perceiving this problem and for actively taking measures to resolve it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for her report as I believe that it deals with a very important social problem. In Europe, we have become used to the fact that very often, things move when they have economic importance. I would like to emphasise, in particular, that the report points out that violence against women in Europe causes damage in the order of billions each year. Violence is present at all levels: among the poor, the rich, the poorly educated and those with university degrees alike. Moreover, it must also be said that every year, several hundred women are indeed victims of crime within the family.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A form of violence which has no precedent has also appeared in Europe, as has already been mentioned here. Female genital mutilation and also honour killings are taking their toll in Europe. Obviously, we would like a European norm to be created to overcome violence against women. However, we know full well that this is almost impossible in the absence of a legal basis. Nevertheless, what can be done is to create a common European strategy. Even if we are unable to harmonise legal systems, clearly, exchanging good practices may be of significant help in this area. The report also points out that there are some violent acts which are not recognised as violent acts by certain legal systems. I believe that cooperation may bring some progress in the future, but what may make this cooperation effective is primarily a European strategy, which is very much needed. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson. We know that violence against women and children is increasing across Europe. For this reason, we urge the Commission to submit a proposal, as it has already promised, for a strategy on violence against women by 2011. This should be all-inclusive, in the sense that it should cover domestic violence and genital mutilation, but also some more insidious forms. I am thinking of severe discrimination and bullying in the workplace against women who are pregnant or intend to marry and who are called on to resign beforehand, which is something that happens in my country but is no longer a crime as it was in the past. I am also thinking of what can only be described as the incitement to violence perpetrated by the media and advertising.</p>
      <p sl="it">After the directive on trafficking in human beings and the imminent directive on the victims of violence, announced by Commissioner Malmström, I think that the Treaty of Lisbon has laid the basis for achieving greater legal harmonisation in the way Member States acknowledge the importance of crimes of violence against women and children as specific forms of violence, as well as defining the essential standards of services for consulting, legal assistance and protection for women and children in cooperation with NGOs. It will also lead to consistent and comparable statistics with impact analyses of forms of prevention and enforcement by Member States to ensure a reduction in violence.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think, in this respect, that there is a common will by Parliament – I was one of the signatories to the written declaration – to define a year of reflection across Europe on the theme of violence, and I think that Parliament can add its very strong and very influential voice to this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, violence against women is a serious violation of human rights, as we have all already asserted. It is an old and global problem, affecting countries that are culturally and geographically distinct; that are more- and less-developed. This situation is frequently associated with dysfunctional families; families in the most marginal social and economic strata. Nevertheless, in truth, it is a phenomenon that exists in many families, irrespective of their level of education, economic position or social standing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is estimated that nearly a fifth of women in Europe have been the victim of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives. The priority is therefore to provide support for women who are victims of violence, and this report contains a set of initiatives with this aim: notable among these are legal assistance for victims, stronger and more effective criminal investigation, the important measure of creating refuges for victims and establishing an emergency number, and provision for deterrent penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the crime.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The damage to the physical and mental health of women who are victims is incalculable, but society also bears high costs. Combating this phenomenon therefore requires political and social mobilisation. After all, this is a question of ensuring equality and development. For this reason, the organisation of a European year of combating violence against women is to be welcomed, as it will have the effect of raising awareness of this terrible scourge among the European public.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to thank Eva-Britt Svensson for preparing an excellent report. The real violations of women’s rights and violence against women highlighted by the rapporteur show once again that these truly are violations of a person’s fundamental rights, which know no geographical, economic, cultural or social limits.</p>
      <p sl="lt">According to the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme adopted last year, the Commission should, as a matter of urgency, draw up a strategy for combating violence against women, and I therefore call on the Commission to take concrete action as quickly as possible and to present such a strategy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Gender-based violence covers sexual abuse, human trafficking, forced marriage and genital mutilation, and such violent crimes have an extraordinary impact on and do irreparable damage to a woman’s physical and mental health. I would therefore like to call on the Member States to ensure better training for healthcare providers, social workers, the police and judicial authorities, and well coordinated cooperation, to enable them to respond to all cases of violence against women in a professional manner.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to thank Commissioner Malmström, although she is no longer present, for the funding and support allocated to non-governmental organisations for combating violence against women, and would also like to recall that during the economic and financial crisis, instances of violence are even more widespread.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, although we have been drawing attention to violence against women and the violation of their rights for several decades, it has not proven possible to stop this reprehensible form of criminal activity. The various forms of violence against women damage not only the women themselves, but also their families. Family life often loses its meaning, which is to provide a sense of safety and security. Children who encounter violence at home are, in a sense, also its victims. We must therefore pay attention at the European level to the possible exposure of women and children to domestic violence.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the case of older women or women who are physically or mentally weaker, the problem of self-defence and the protection of their own interests is even more complicated. Women are also exposed to gender-based abuse through various forms of violation of personal freedoms, since human trafficking for sexual purposes in particular, for example, is one of the most serious problems affecting all of society.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is vital, therefore, to press for more effective criminal prosecutions, and to ensure that the subsequent punishments reflect the seriousness of the crime. It is essential to take steps to prevent these serious violations of human rights and freedoms, and to guarantee European women a dignified life.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I would like to focus on two points: violence against women and the role of men as workers in hotels.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The figure of 25% of women having suffered violence is totally unacceptable. I think it suggests the need for an educational programme amongst young males, in particular, in anger management and respect for females, so that the idea of raising your hand to a female would be absolutely taboo and not the norm, as is often presented in films, in some cultures and, sadly it seems, in some homes.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The second point I want to mention is the role of men as workers in hotels. The reason I say that is that there was a friend of mine, a beautiful young girl, Michaela Harte, killed in Mauritius on her honeymoon when she walked in on workers in the hotel who were robbing her room. If it were the other way around, and a male walked in on females, the chances of their being killed would be far less. There is a need to look at that risk and probability. The whole question of males and their access to rooms, especially female's rooms, has to be looked at.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by our Chair, Mrs Svensson, which highlights the need to view all forms of violence as crimes amenable to criminal law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a general rule, I particularly appreciate the fact that the European Union is composed of States with diverse and varied national cultures and traditions, but when it comes to violence, I am appalled to see the differences in treatment that exist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us take one example: rape. Although it is amenable to criminal law everywhere, it is not defined in the same way in all the Member States. As far as Latvia is concerned, marital rape simply does not exist. In Malta, the rape of a man by another man does not exist. In Slovakia, to be raped with an object is not considered rape. Hence, there are women, men and children with shattered lives lying behind all of these definitions. To trivialise the definition of crimes is to trivialise the victims themselves, and their suffering. I therefore call on the Commission urgently to develop an effective road map against all forms of violence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it has been very clear in the debate that violence against women is not a trivial offence; it is quite clearly a violation of human rights. It has already been said that even children are sometimes indirect victims of violence against women. They can even be direct victims of violence against women, because the main cause of still births and miscarriages is certainly the effects of violence against women. It is not only a question of domestic violence; there is also forced prostitution, honour killings – where there can actually be no question of honour – human trafficking, genital mutilation and much more besides.</p>
      <p sl="de">The trigger for this report, for which I am very grateful to Mrs Svensson, was, in this case, not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women, but also the fact that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in Europe.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, violence against women takes many forms, and it remains an international problem with which the international community has still not managed to get to grips. The use of violence compromises the health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims. As a consequence, the women concerned are restricted in their opportunities to participate in social life and work.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, we just need to consider the costs to see that violence against women is also a social problem, for example, in areas of health and justice. Women are at most risk within their own four walls. The commonest cause of injuries in women is domestic violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Violence against women, whatever form it takes, is not a trivial offence. The EU must also sign the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the exposure of an individual to any form of violence has far-reaching destructive consequences for the family and society, and particularly merits condemnation when committed against women and children. However, I consider it alarming that domestic violence is identified as the main cause of miscarriages or stillbirths, and I am therefore pressing for all the available resources of criminal law to be applied to the effective suppression and prevention of physical violence.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to draw attention to the urgent need to protect women, and especially poor women, from so-called surrogate motherhood. Under the pretext of solidarity, surrogate motherhood exposes women to physical exploitation and even abuse, in direct conflict with the ban on trafficking in human bodies and body parts. A woman’s dignity, intimacy and body are degraded in this way, and they become the subject of corrupt rental agreements on the international human trafficking market.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, although violent acts against women are the most prevalent in the world, they are still the least likely to be punished, whether committed in conflict zones or democratic countries. There are regions around the world where violence against women assumes every form: rape, sex trafficking, forced marriages, death, abductions for religious or criminal reasons, forced prostitution, not to mention violence within the family or from former partners. In addition, the age of girls being subjected to violence is steadily falling.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that Member States should make additional efforts at EU level to provide comprehensive national statistics which will cover, to a greater extent, gender-based violence, as well as to improve the collection of data on this issue, with the aim of finding the most suitable solutions for punishing the culprits.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also regard as useful the proposal for establishing an observatory on violence against women as part of the European Institute for Gender Equality, in close collaboration with the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I believe that it is time for us to go beyond the superficial approach to this issue because the lack of statistics, the lack of any consistent regulations on criminalising this issue in Member States, and the lack of concern for this matter, apart from general statements being made, confirm that this is indeed a subject which is handled superficially in the European Union. This is why a directive is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The economic costs have not been analysed in any great depth, unfortunately neither in this report nor in other documents on the subject. This is because this issue, which is currently exacerbated by the economic crisis, incurs quite considerable financial costs for national budgets, amounting to hundreds of millions of euro. I believe that it is time for us to quantify these costs and attempt to respond to this situation using not only financial means, but also suitable legal instruments for tackling this problem.</p>

I am proud of the fact that in Hungary, it was I who wrote the first two books on the phenomenon of violence against women about 15 years ago. I am less proud that next to nothing has happened in this area since then. It is a fact that there is no, and neither can there be any, single EU regulation, but a lot of European taxpayers’ money goes on prevention and care programmes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to address a question mainly to the Commissioner about how the appropriate spending of these funds is checked. I have a suggestion: instead of asking the governments, ask the abused women concerned: for example, women who have been abused and taken refuge in shelters for women should be asked about the help they have received and the attitude of authorities to their cases in general, or girls and women suffering on the streets of Budapest or, say, Amsterdam, and who are hoping to escape from the hell of prostitution, should be asked about the type of help they have received from their state or government.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, as is also clearly indicated in the report, the efforts to reduce violence against women must be supported on two fronts: at Member State level and through measures and programmes managed directly by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that it is of paramount importance to continue the Daphne Programme and to encourage the participation of Member States which are faced with a rise in this form of violence in the current difficult economic circumstances. Nowadays, many people are facing psychological problems which sometimes trigger violence. It is vital to provide training to staff working for the European Union’s police authorities as a basis for ensuring that investigations are carried out properly, with a good understanding of the issue and of the impact violence has on women. This aspect is also supported as part of the Stockholm Programme.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, the political effort must be backed up with financial support, and the Daphne Programme can provide a suitable framework for this.</p>

      <p sl="de">In addition to the horrific nature of the matter, violence against women is also expensive. The report states that the annual cost of this violence is EUR 33 billion. That should take the wind out of the sails of those who say that the catalogue of measures that has now been established will clearly have a cost, too. This catalogue of measures is necessary, however. Training of police officers, judges, medical personnel – all of this is contained in the report, and I would also like to duly thank the rapporteur for that.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, when we see examples in the media of maimed women and children, we always ask ourselves how those around them could have remained ignorant of it for so long. It is therefore necessary that the proposed strategy of the Commission for combating domestic violence includes specific diagnostic mechanisms that are mandatory for health facilities and also for social workers, making it possible to provide genuinely rapid assistance to the victims. Violence motivated through religious rituals must be severely punished, and this, together with a culture of awareness that includes training for judges, will lead to zero tolerance in society of violence against women, including the mutilation of female organs. The strategy should also consider a free legal service and social assistance for victims of violence. I would like to thank Mrs Svensson for a highly detailed report, but I will vote against part of recital J, because it promotes the right of women to kill their foetuses, and I do not agree with that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for this very important debate on a subject that is obviously dear to many of us. Again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her important report, and also the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I outlined in my introduction, we are planning several measures on this. The victims’ rights package is, of course, extremely important and will come next month. We also have the general equality policy for prevention programmes, awareness-raising and so on. We are also following very closely the finalisation, right now, of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, in order – when it is ready – to propose to the Council that the European Union adhere to it, which would then make it legally binding in the areas where the European Union has competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to mention two other proposals that you have adopted: the directive on combating trafficking, for instance, contains a lot of preventive measures but also support for victims, for women and children who are victims of trafficking for sexual and other purposes. Also in the different parts of the asylum package, special notice is taken of vulnerable people in asylum procedures, such as women who have been victims of sexual violence, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is, as you have all outlined, enormous, and it is a shame that women and girls in our European Union are afraid on a daily basis. They are afraid of violence, rape and sexual abuse, and often from the people they love the most, whom they should be able to trust the most – husbands, partners, etc. We need to act, and we need to act where we can see concrete results. This is surely one of the most horrendous violations of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to congratulate those very few but still brave men who have contributed to this debate, because violence against women is not a women’s issue: it is a human rights issue. We can only achieve results here if we work together, men and women, to combat this horrendous phenomenon. We need to work together: we need to achieve a Europe where women and girls do not have to fear violence just because they belong to the so-called ‘wrong sex’.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their very wise words during the debate and, above all, for the resolve that I can see that all my fellow Members have to fight this violence. To the Commission, I would like to say that we look forward to the victims of crime package to provide further support for victims, but we also need a directive to combat this violence. It is not necessary to agree with every word in this report, but it is important to vote in favour of it in order to send a strong signal to the Commission that we need a directive. It is important to show all of these women who live in abusive relationships that they should not feel ashamed or guilty. By voting ‘yes’ to the report, we will show that the guilt is a crime that is committed against them. They must not feel guilt or shame.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like to say that there are many of us women who have survived as a result of the efforts of society and through the work of shelters for women and women’s organisations. It is now high time that these people and organisations did not have to shoulder the responsibility alone for helping women out of the situation that many of them are living in. What is important is that we break the silence and that we show that there is support for these vulnerable people. I would also like to emphasise how important it is to show that this is a problem that cuts across all social groups. There are no particular groups that are affected; it is found throughout society. I appeal to my fellow Members to send out the signal that it is no longer acceptable for women to have to live under these conditions. Women can establish a good life for themselves and their children, but to do so they also need support from us as elected representatives. My thanks once again to all Members for your strong resolve. Together, we will succeed in this fight.</p>

      <p sl="en">I wish to express support for this report and its recommendations. Research shows that the situation in my own state of Ireland mirrors the problem experienced across Europe. In 2005, the National Crime Council found that one in seven women in Ireland have experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from their partner. In 2009, I became the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in the town of Dundalk. This support and counselling service is one of many across the east of Ireland offering vital support for victims of sexual and domestic violence, yet it has to cope with a very difficult funding environment. What is important is that the EU directs funding for research across Member States to ensure we have a full and accurate picture of the scope of the problem. But there also needs to be support for NGOs and Member State governments to raise awareness about the impact and effects of sexual violence, be it domestic, rape or human trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>

As a result of its social consequences, the economic crisis has helped exacerbate the situation in circumstances where poverty and the lack of education are factors conducive to gender-based violence. This is why I think that coordinated measures are required against the causes of this problem, along with legislative harmonisation and closer judicial cooperation between Member States, with the aim of conducting investigations more efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to put an end to violence against women, EU Member States and institutions have a duty to initiate as a matter of urgency some of the following actions: information and awareness-raising campaigns, setting up refuges for victims, setting up a single telephone number across the EU for immediate assistance and providing support for highly vulnerable groups of women such as immigrants and asylum seekers.</p>

      <p sl="en">In 2008, when I was a member of the Latvian Parliament, I tabled a draft amendment to the Criminal Law of the Latvian Republic, toughening responsibility for domestic violence to women and children. Unfortunately, the amendment did not go through. At the meeting of the specialised commission, when the amendment was being discussed, members of the Latvian Parliament behaved cheerfully. As a result, cases of ‘light’ injuries of children and women in families remain unpunished. Cases are usually not investigated and sometimes the police refuse to accept applications from victims. The protection of women from domestic violence is not regulated by efficient instruments in the Latvian Republic. The Latvian authorities, the government, keep their eyes closed on obvious violations and are not going to put legislation in order. In the light of this report, I appeal to all members of the European Parliament to pay attention to lawless behaviour towards women that is occurring in Latvia.</p>

      <p sl="de">It can happen anywhere: on the street, on the underground, in someone’s own home – women and children cannot feel 100% safe from attack anywhere. The deadening pseudo-morality found in society should give us pause for thought. The early stages of actual violence, such as intrusiveness, obscene remarks and harassment meted out by many migrants to western women on a daily basis are increasingly regarded as normal. The disregard for women has reached peak levels when a German judge refers to the husband’s right of procreation as a decisive factor in her judgment in a Muslim divorce case. By permitting migration, the EU has imported problems from every country of the world, including honour killings, forced marriages and domestic violence in patriarchal family structures. Culture, religion and tradition must not be used to justify acts of violence. That is the only way to break the spiral of violence. The statistics provide no information on the extent to which the recorded increase in reported cases of domestic violence is related to the increased willingness of the victims to stand up for themselves or what proportion of these are immigrants. It is a fact in any case that a large number of migrants are registered in women’s refuges. It is also a fact that we need to put a stop to the pseudo-do-gooder mentality that treats crimes committed with a religious or cultural motive with leniency.</p>

      <p sl="it">My commitment to the protection of the weak and women afflicted by violence compels me to vote in favour of legislation to guarantee the protection of victims of violence. Women, like children, are particularly fragile members of our society in some contexts. I therefore think it is important to ensure greater protection to women who claim they have suffered violence. I am thus in favour of free legal assistance to women who are victims of violence. I know there is a risk of inequality when men unjustly accused of violence have to pay court costs while their accusers receive legal aid: I have thought about this carefully. However, I believe that the number of cases of violence, including family violence, should lead us to take the side of those who suffer the most serious damage from lack of support: female victims of violence are statistically a much more dominant share than the few criminals who take advantage of the system to get the better of innocent men. It is difficult for battered women to file a complaint; free legal assistance would encourage the victims and help reduce the number of incidents that have gone unpunished.</p>

      <p sl="fr">When we talk about violence against women, we often lack data, statistics and trends. What we need, above anything else, is to be able to measure this phenomenon at European level, in order to understand the scale of the problem. This will help us to better target needs and hence prevent cases of violence, help the victims and heal the wounds. We must remember the victims at all times. Whether we are talking about sexual abuse, the trafficking of women for prostitution, domestic violence or even violence with a cultural dimension – I am thinking here of genital mutilation and forced marriages – they are still serious crimes. We need to come up with a general European framework to protect women from this type of violence. We must stop being so nervous of the idea of making Europe the protector of women. We need a European legal framework within which to implement concrete measures such as the emergency telephone number, and training programmes for the police, the judiciary and teachers. The EU must offer solutions within Europe, but as a global player, it must also extend the scope of its action to outside its borders.</p>

      <p sl="et">Unfortunately, it has not been possible to stop violence against women in Europe and in the world as a whole, even though the European Union and the UN have stated that combating violence against women is a priority for them. It is true that there has been some progress and that people’s awareness regarding this subject has increased somewhat, but the European Union’s new political priorities are indispensable for combating violence against women more effectively and for achieving our common objective that women and children should not constantly live in fear of falling victim to violence. The Treaty of Lisbon also provides the legal competence for this. I consider it extremely important for the European Union to pay more attention in its legislation to violence which takes place between people in close relationships, because this is by no means a private matter. Unfortunately, victims all too often fear for their family’s reputation and, justifiably, their safety and economic dependence, and so they do not go to the law enforcement authorities. We should therefore also direct particular attention to developing a victim support system and overturning taboos that exist in society – in other words, we should improve people’s awareness. The help provided to victims must be genuine and guaranteed. One definite problem is a lack of shelters in Europe designed for women and children who have suffered violence, so the objective to build one shelter per 10 000 inhabitants for victims of crime is an entirely reasonable and necessary one. In order to ensure that protection for women fleeing violence and persecution is improved, even if they change their place of residence in Europe, it is important to implement the directive on protection orders.</p>

These gangs often dupe mainly young women and then force them to work as prostitutes. Many are driven to suicide in order to put an end to their nightmare. We need to examine more closely the countries which are the starting point for trafficking gangs, where traffickers buy silence and consent from government officials, turning these countries into havens for human rights abuses. These gangs could be combated through transnational cooperation between the EU, which is the destination, and these countries, which are the starting point for these illegal gangs. I call on the Commission to take action in this direction. Obviously, the organisations involved in women’s rights seriously have their work cut out in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="cs">This report represents the third contribution in recent months towards combating violence against women, following the European Protection Order and the directive on combating human trafficking. Violence against women is unquestionably a serious problem in all sections of society. The data in the report speaks of one woman in four experiencing physical violence in adulthood, with more than 10% of women becoming victims of sexual violence. These are alarming figures, behind which lie individual life stories. At the same time, only one in ten victims of violence seeks professional help. The reason for this is that most of them do not know how to deal with the situation. Violence against women has enormously destructive effects, not only on the women themselves, but also negative consequences for the people around them, and children in particular. I support the proposals leading to greater awareness and training for people who may come into contact with this form of violence in the course of their work. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure better care and assistance for the victims. I also welcome the report because of the need to send a clear and strong message to society that violence will not be tolerated.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Human rights and gender equality are among the EU’s priorities. Since violence against women is a brutal violation of human rights and one of the main obstacles standing in the way of equality between women and men, the fight against this scourge should become our main objective. The approach taken to violence against women differs according to national legislation. Some Member States, for example, Spain, have well thought-out regulations in this area. Some do not have any at all. There are also significant differences in terms of the conviction rate for violence against women in the individual Member States. In view of the Member States’ differing legal regulations and frequently limited influence in terms of enforcing the provisions of international law with regard to the fight against violence, the need for clear and binding regulations at EU level in respect of the problem is becoming ever more apparent. The various EU actions need to be summarised and presented in a single comprehensive strategy, the aim of which will be to combat violence against women throughout the EU. This strategy should be consistent with other international initiatives and be based on available EU programmes and best practices in the Member States. Work on a joint directive against violence should be completed within this parliamentary term. This is necessary in order to ensure that it can never be said again that even cows enjoy better protection in the European Union than women.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We are all aware of violence against women, and we debate it, but when it comes to eliminating or doing away with it, the results are poor. Violence affects women at various times of life, from childhood to adulthood. It happens in school, at work, in peer groups, in public and also in private family life, or life with a partner. It takes many forms – from physical and sexual to mental and social, and even economic violence. It is experienced by women from different educational backgrounds, socio-economic positions, ethnic groups and religions, and by women from both urban and rural environments. It should be emphasised, however, that violence against women is a problem that we must all address. Eliminating it requires not only active institutions, but also active individuals – men and women – who do not turn a blind eye to this unpleasant phenomenon in our society, and who are willing to get involved personally in enforcing the principle of zero tolerance. The individual Member States must play a greater role in this, drawing up action plans for combating violence against women, boosting media awareness and adopting specific criminal laws and measures.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, despite all our efforts, violence against women, and violence in other areas of life, is still a major problem in Europe. Violent crimes are committed in all Member States, and they affect people from all social strata. This means that the fight against this problem and assistance for its victims must be multi-faceted. In order to prevent this kind of violence, it is important to support families and ensure their harmonious development. With regard to crimes involving violence against women, I believe it would be worth considering the introduction of a single European emergency telephone number, which could be called to obtain support or report a crime of this kind. The EU should aim to ensure that tougher punishments are meted out for violence against women, in particular, in the case of crimes involving sexual violence. Such crimes often remain etched in the minds of the women involved for many years, causing them to suffer and making it impossible for them to function normally. It is also imperative that better protection for the rights of victims in criminal proceedings be introduced at the same time. A key issue referred to in the report is the problem of prostitution and trafficking in women. In order to combat this practice effectively, what is needed is a pan-European agreement involving not only the EU Member States, but also countries outside the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, some honourable Members may be getting tired of me but I think this joint debate on migration flows is very timely. This will be both a general discussion of the role and scope of EU foreign policy, as outlined in Mr Provera’s report, and an opportunity for me to inform you about how the EU is responding to the crisis in the Southern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by thanking Mr Provera for his excellent report which I read with great interest. It is a very timely subject for discussion, as is the role that EU foreign policy should play with regard to the very complex and multi-faceted nature of migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by outlining some elements of the EU response to the crisis in the Southern Mediterranean and then move to the more general role of EU foreign policy. As you all know, we are faced with a situation in the Southern Mediterranean that has become very critical in recent weeks with regard to the migration flows involved. More than 400 000 people have been displaced since the outbreak of the changes in Northern Africa and in Libya. Most of these people are third-country nationals who have come to Tunisia or to Egypt. A majority of them have been repatriated to their countries but a few thousand are still there and I will come back to them in a little while.</p>
      <p sl="en">Around 20 000 migrants, mainly from Tunisia and, to a lesser extent, from other African countries, have managed to enter the European Union irregularly, reaching the shores of Lampedusa and Malta. Both of these islands are therefore under strong migratory pressure. The European Union has already responded to these serious, but different, challenges in an effective and rapid manner, taking three concrete actions. Firstly, the Commission has mobilised EUR 30 million to manage the humanitarian emergency generated by the sudden inflows of migrants and refugees in the countries neighbouring Libya. With the assistance of funds provided on a bilateral basis by the Member States and other international donors, it has been possible to offer temporary shelter to migrants and refugees, to meet their basic needs, and to return them to their respective countries of origin.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we have reacted to the irregular and mixed flows across the Mediterranean Sea. Frontex, with the assistance of several Member States, launched Joint Operation Hermes, aimed at assisting Italy in controlling vessels that carry migrants and refugees. What is more, Europol has deployed a team of experts to Italy with the aim of helping the law enforcement authorities to identify possible criminal networks involved in trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the Commission has tried to ensure that, in the very short term, the Member States exposed to the growing flows of refugees and irregular migrants could cope with the financial consequences of this displacement. We have rapidly identified EUR 25 million which could be mobilised under the External Borders Fund and European Refugee Fund if and when specific requests are made by the Member States. Only one request has been made so far, but we are ready to consider further urgent requests.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that this first response has been comprehensive; it is clear, however, that we need to do more. We need to set up a more structured, sustainable plan able to cover the various dimensions of this phenomenon, based on solidarity between Member States and in full respect of the European Union’s international obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have visited Egypt with the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Martonyi, and Tunisia with my colleague, Commissioner Füle, who is responsible for neighbourhood policy. This was partly in response to the conclusions of the European Council, which asked the Commission to liaise very actively with these two countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the run-up to our June JHA Council, I intend to propose a package of proposals to the Commission in May that will address the EU approach in the area of migration, mobility and security with the Southern Mediterranean countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several measures need to be taken in the short term. On the continuous and possible increase of flows of refugees coming from the Libyan territory, the following actions will be considered: an adequate level of funds needs to remain available to support the provision of humanitarian assistance. In this context, funds will have to be earmarked to meet the basic needs of the refugees, to facilitate their return to their countries of origin, when appropriate, and to support their successful social and professional reintegration back home.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, an increasing number of refugees fleeing Libya are third-country nationals who were residing in Libya as refugees or asylum seekers. These people, a few thousand, cannot be returned to their countries of origin. Resettlement needs to be considered. The Commission is ready to facilitate this process and calls upon the Member States to take responsibility and to engage in such resettlement efforts. There will be financial support for this, from the European Refugee Fund in particular. In this context, it is imperative that the Council and the European Parliament make an effort to rapidly achieve an agreement on the European Resettlement Programme. All three institutions are in agreement on the political aim of this; we must find a way out of this institutional deadlock.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also urgent to develop a regional protection programme encompassing Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. Under the thematic programme for cooperation with third countries, the Commission has plans to allocate EUR 3.6 million to support such a programme. The deployment of EASO teams to the Member States affected by these flows will also be considered, with a view to helping the authorities screen the asylum seekers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in the event of a massive influx of displaced persons and if the conditions foreseen in the directive are met, the Commission would be ready to consider making use of the mechanisms foreseen under the 2001 Temporary Protection Directive so as to provide immediate protection for these people on the territory of other EU Member States. The intention would be to give breathing space to the national asylum systems and to promote voluntary solidarity measures between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the continuous inflows of irregular migrants coming from the Southern Mediterranean, which could increase, the Commission believes that Joint Operation Hermes, coordinated by Frontex, should receive additional resources from Member States. Frontex will stand ready to provide logistical and financial support to assist the Member States concerned, to organise return flights, and to deploy Rapid Border Intervention Teams if they wish.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential that the competences of Frontex are strengthened rapidly and more effective tools are put at its disposal. The amended regulation establishing the Frontex agency should be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specific projects are also being prepared by EU services and will shortly be launched, in partnership with the countries concerned, starting with Tunisia and Egypt. The aim is to enhance their capacity to control their borders – in cooperation with the relevant authorities – to fight against criminal organisations promoting the smuggling of migrants and people trafficking, to facilitate readmission and social and professional reintegration, and to identify and register migrants entering the territory and treat them in accordance with international standards by offering asylum to those in need of international protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">These measures represent the immediate answer to the situation. However, we also need to implement long-term, sustainable programmes. With my partners in Tunisia and Egypt, we discussed bringing in working arrangements on a variety of issues covered under the Mobility Partnership. This could take the form of a new tailor-made EU approach, considering each country on its own merits, and taking into account the EU’s overall foreign policy with a given country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Partnerships could cover everything from visa facilitation, under certain conditions and for specific categories, labour migration, preventing irregular migrant flows, setting up asylum systems, readmission, law enforcement, return, etc. We agreed with the two countries’ interior ministers to set up a working arrangement and to start identifying what we can do together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that this coherent EU foreign policy approach will help to set up a long-term system to address migration flows and this brings me to Mr Provera’s report. Protracted, long-standing conflicts and humanitarian crises in regions, such as the one we are talking about, are important factors fuelling South-South migration and migration towards the EU. Our main global challenges, such as migration, fully underline the importance of developing a comprehensive approach linking security, stability, crisis management and development.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the report suggests, such an approach must be based on a strong human rights approach, notably with regard to migrants’ rights. Special attention must be given to the situation of vulnerable groups. We share the view that it is crucial to put in place more long-term, sustainable cooperation programmes to address migration, mobility and security, in combination with the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and good governance with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach should be tailor-made, as I have described, looking at each country on its individual merits. This comprehensive approach fits in with other policy processes such as the nexus between security and development, which is mentioned in both the European Security strategy and the European Consensus on Development.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to mobilise the full range of policies and instruments at our disposal with regard to poverty eradication, early-warning systems and preventive diplomacy, humanitarian aid, crisis response actions, including sanctions, crisis management missions and post-conflict reconstruction and peace building.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is therefore very timely, as the EU currently has to deal with a crisis. But it also represents a possibility to start something new, the possibility to support the fantastic new democratic forces that are emerging: there is a great willingness to reform countries, especially in Tunisia but also in Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Global Approach to Migration, as an external dimension of the EU’s migration policy, is to be based on a genuine partnership with third countries. This is mentioned in the Stockholm Programme and the Stockholm Action Plan and we will provide further initiatives in the Global Approach to Migration presented this autumn. The aim is to define the objectives of the approach more clearly and in more strategic terms. It will propose priorities, principles and concrete measures but will also look more closely at the link between migration and development and between migration and climate change, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that you are all willing to discuss different elements of this. It is a complex and very difficult issue which demands a great deal of time and effort to assess properly. It is also very event-driven and it changes almost by the hour. So far, the Commission has tried to be constructive and to address this in a very comprehensive and inclusive way. I look forward to taking your questions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this tragically topical own-initiative report was first drawn up more than a year ago to assess the phenomenon of immigration and its structural causes in a pragmatic and balanced manner, regardless of political or ideological prejudices.</p>
      <p sl="it">We wanted to investigate the role of foreign policy and its ability to have an effect on the deep-seated causes of immigration, beyond humanitarian or emergency causes. Wars, ethnic tensions, persistent climate change, human rights violations, a lack of civil and economic liberties, endemic corruption, a lack of institutional representatives of citizens’ needs, such as trade unions, associations, political parties: the set of all these elements represents the field of deployment of European foreign policy and resolving these problems will remove many of the reasons that cause millions of people to emigrate.</p>
      <p sl="it">No development cooperation policy can be fully effective without tackling the causes of instability in migrants’ countries of origin. This involves regional cooperation with both with the country of origin and the country of transit, including through bilateral agreements. The Millennium Development Goals are already very ambitious, but certainly will not be achieved without political stability and without implementing effective mechanisms for preventing conflicts and maintaining peace. The global reach of this policy and its holistic approach require clear ideas and substantial financial resources that are difficult to come by in this moment of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore advisable to coordinate the actions of the Union with those of other major powers such as the United States to avoid duplication of funding in the same areas or dispersal of financial resources, as has often happened in the past. A global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global policy. We must lead the migrants’ countries of origin to democracy and good governance by making available our values and our experience.</p>
      <p sl="it">Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, we should offer an economic agenda that can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real economic development consistent with market laws. Commissioner Füle and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, drew attention, with the slogan ‘more for more’, to the concept of conditionality of aid which aims to reward countries that are most actively setting out on the road to democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This is consistent with our European values, effective for development and – if you will allow me – morally fair to taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by stating that a European policy for the management of large migration flows should go hand in hand with acceptance of the concept of ‘burden sharing’, in line with the duty of State solidarity under Article 80 of the Treaty, because no country can face up to an emergency of enormous proportions by itself.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I thank Commissioner Malmström for her support for some or many points in this report, and I hope that Europe can actually work with Italy to address a phenomenon that has an international dimension and that affects every one of us.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the productive cooperation I received while drafting this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In relation to the particular subject we are debating today, the exodus of people from the Mediterranean region is not only a problem for the countries in this area, as the entire European Union has a responsibility to resolve this urgent humanitarian situation. This is a specific situation which we were not anticipating when this report was drafted. The view of the Committee on Development is that the priority must be to tackle the humanitarian situation and provide aid to the refugees. However, we cannot accept the extremely populist solutions suggested whereby the citizens of Lampedusa were promised that immigrants would be got rid of within 60 hours. Evacuations to the mainland region followed, but after the destination regions refused to accommodate the camps, repatriation got under way.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I find it unacceptable that France and Germany have refused to take some of the refugees and that the Italian Minister for the Interior is threatening to grant temporary residence permits, which would allow thousands of immigrants to move around the European Union. These are not constructive and inclusive responses, in keeping with Member States’ commitments. Neither selfishness nor forced solidarity feature among the values on which the European Union has been built. This is why I believe that we must insist as firmly as possible on dialogue and cooperation in order to identify common solutions to this serious problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, migration is not only happening from everywhere else to Europe. In fact, most migration happens outside Europe, within countries or regions on other continents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently, Pakistan and Syria are the countries that are hosting the most migrants – we should not forget that. There are various reasons for migration: war, conflict, poverty, discrimination, violence and persecution, family, climate change and many more. We should address these issues and we should fight the push factors rather than the migrants themselves. In order to fight those push factors, we need a good development policy and, there, conditionality will not help much.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to revise policies that go against our development goals, as sometimes happens in trade policy and agriculture. But we also need a good policy on democracy and promoting human rights. In the past, the Community and the Member States have cooperated with third countries on stopping migrants and not on human rights. The Commission had been negotiating an agreement with Libya to give support and aid to Libya so that Gaddafi would stop migrants. Now is the time to change that. I am very happy to hear that you agree with me that we urgently need to change to a more human rights-based approach. We should not forget that stability is not the only thing people want and need. Stability without democracy is not a sustainable way forward. Stability plus poverty does not offer any prospects. Stability is important, but it is not the only thing that matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must not close the doors to the few migrants worldwide that take the road to Europe. We need a common asylum system that gives efficient protection to those in need and we also need to protect conflict migrants. We need fair access to legal migration that gives migrants proper social rights. We need to find a way to protect climate migrants, as they have to flee because we cause climate change. We also need to revise our visa and border policies from a human rights perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not be scared of migrants. They are people like us, often in dire need, looking for a better life and peace and prosperity. Is that not what the EU was founded for?</p>
      <p sl="en">So I ask the Commission: will the common asylum system be put in place? Whatever happened to the Blue Card Regulation? And how will you ensure that Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty, namely, the principle of not harming our development goals, will be fully implemented?</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, above all, for the commitment you have made in putting together this package of measures, which I believe sends out a political signal making it clear that this is not Malta’s problem, this is not Italy’s problem, this is not Spain’s problem: this is a European problem.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that this is the thrust of the references you made to the solidarity between Member States and the European Neighbourhood Policy, the desire to promote adequate funding for the humanitarian emergency, assistance, repatriation and training, to intervene in the topic of asylum seekers, to draw up a programme that breaks the impasse, the sacrosanct reference to Directive 2001/55/EC, and the desire to strengthen the Hermes operation. All this is truly a sign of a European desire to challenge the apathy and the inconsistency of many months.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, allow me to explain what lies at the heart of our concern. We are not primarily concerned about the 20 000 who arrived in Lampedusa. We are concerned with the political fact that this represents. For example, what happened in 1989, with the implosion of the Eastern system and the fall of communism, was a great burden, for example, on German and Austria, but then they found European solidarity. An attempt was made to respond politically to that challenge and offer a road map, which resulted in the integration of many countries and many peoples, who are now in this House.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do not expect much. There are no grounds for integration of the Mediterranean, but there are grounds for a neighbourhood policy finally worthy of the name, for a European Mediterranean strategy finally worthy of the name. This is what we are asking of Europe. I believe that what you said is along those lines.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to request, on the subject of Directive 2001/55/EC, for example, that in addition to referring to it as you did, the Commission should come up with a real proposal to bring to the Council, that it should be voted in by the Council with a qualified majority, and that this should lead European countries to an unavoidable understanding that the problem of immigrants is a European problem and an understanding that the problem of protecting immigrants is a European problem that we can no longer evade.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, I also took part in the last debate in the Chamber on this very topic and I can only regret that, as only some of the proposals made in that debate have been taken into account, we have the numbers and the situations we are seeing today, specifically in Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are aware of Mrs Malmström’s help and the efforts she is making, as Commissioner for the Home Affairs portfolio, to strengthen the European Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund and, of course, running the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Members States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, this crisis in the Mediterranean clearly shows that the issue is not only one of the credibility but of the viability of the European common immigration policy, which aims for an area of freedom, security and justice, in line with Articles 67 to 89 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The upshot of this is that this transformational challenging European foreign policy, challenging the viability of that strategy for the Mediterranean, of that association for the Mediterranean, poses a particular challenge to the humanitarian impact and significance of Europe in the handling of the humanitarian impact of displaced persons and potential asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
      <p sl="es">Consequently, I should again like to stress that one function of this debate should be to break, for once and for all, the deadlock on the asylum package; to call attention, for once and for all, to the need to implement and ensure compliance with Directive 2001/55/EC on measures for displaced persons in the case of humanitarian emergencies and massive, unforeseen, flows of emigrants. In addition to this, it should also, and most particularly, be to create a solidarity policy, above and beyond the directive, to bring into effect that solidarity clause that was again written in to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and which should be applied when we are faced with situations like this one.</p>
      <p sl="es">For, indeed, we must be aware that neither Italy, nor Spain, nor Greece, nor any of the border countries on the Mediterranean, are in a position to tackle these problems on their own.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, I am struck by the fact that there has not yet been any call, or request for the activation of Article 5 of that directive to apply that solidarity clause in line with the Treaty. We should obviously use this opportunity to provide a dignified and supportive response to an issue which is, as is the Mediterranean, a distinctively European issue.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, we hear many people express concern about migration today. People are quite simply afraid of mass immigration to Europe following the major events in North Africa recently. These events are sure to be followed by migration flows. It has already started and it is sure to continue. It is inevitable that people will flee from instability and violence, particularly from the current situation in Libya. Hitherto, however, the migration flows have been more horizontal than vertical and primarily concern Tunisia and Egypt, but thousands of people have also arrived on the small Italian island of Lampedusa and this is really putting the solidarity between our Member States to the test. Worryingly enough, the EU Member States have so far not passed this solidarity test and do not seem to be willing to stand by one another in difficult times.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe believes that the most important thing we can do right now is to implement the Asylum Directive. The answer in the slightly longer term is the preparation of a common European asylum policy that is worthy of the name. This will, among other things, provide the opportunity to temporarily stop the transfers of asylum seekers under Dublin II when a Member State, for whatever reason, is extremely overburdened. With solidarity also comes responsibility. Every Member State must now respect and apply the directive that aims to harmonise the protection of people who are fleeing and, before 2012, develop a sustainable European asylum system. We have committed ourselves to implement this and we must do so and we must do it in a spirit of solidarity, with respect for international commitments for the common safety and stability of everyone.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in North Africa itself. The UNHCR estimates that over 400 000 people have already left Libya. That is something that, having listened to the debate on the Procedures Directive earlier, some of our Members would do well to remember: the majority of people are moving within North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">We very much welcome the support given to the UNHCR and other bodies in assisting those displaced. A lot of concern, however, has been voiced at the pressure on Malta and Lampedusa, and quite rightly. It is significant, but not equivalent to what is happening in Tunisia and Egypt. However, there is growing concern about what is happening to minors – unaccompanied or separated at arrival. There is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified. We hope that the Commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also welcome the willingness to consider using the Temporary Protection Directive. Could the Commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, refugees have been received in Lampedusa under appalling conditions, without food or toilet facilities: under conditions that are really inhumane. The detention centre is currently closed, with non-governmental organisations, journalists, and possibly even members of parliament not having access to it. The Italian Refugee Council is requesting that temporary protection orders be granted for these refugees, under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC, and you approved this application, Commissioner. I thank you for your intervention, as this application was wide-ranging and comprehensive. There are things we agree with, and there are things with which we do not agree. However, there is also a name for what is blocking this comprehensive action: the hypocrisy of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">You have spoken, Commissioner, about reaching a codecision on resettlement. As a rapporteur, I can say that Parliament is ready to look at any idea that the Council brings to the table. However, we have been waiting for a year and a half, and we have not heard a single idea about resettlement. It is this hypocrisy by the Member States that allowed Colonel Gaddafi to sweep refugees and immigrants under the carpet for years while they were selling him arms. That is why all the talk about the current lack of resources is also entirely hypocritical. In 2009 alone, European Union countries earned EUR 343 million from arms sales to Colonel Gaddafi, while the initial amount they made available for receiving refugees from the Arab revolutions was EUR 3 million: one hundred times less. I think that this difference says it all.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Lampedusa has been invaded by tens of thousands of North Africans that the island will never ever be able to accept. Italy has, for weeks, been targeted by hundreds of boats of illegal immigrants. If we do not react together, if the EU does not react, the migratory wave of displaced people will continue.</p>
      <p sl="it">The illegal immigrants who have arrived in recent months must be sent home; there is no alternative. However, apart from a few words of solidarity, the Italian Government has been left alone to handle this biblical exodus of such unforeseeable dimensions</p>
      <p sl="it">Where is Europe? Until now, Brussels has been guilty of hiding; my fellow citizens can no longer stand its shameful behaviour. Europe has left Italy alone to face the unprecedented emergency. Europe should instead assist Italy in the repatriation of illegal immigrants and must also support the efforts of the Italian Government to prevent thousands and thousands of people from continuing to leave, mainly from Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Libyan refugees are a different matter: Europe should support Italy in the identification and logistics management operations, but, above all, must work to ensure that refugees are hosted in all Member States. The reception of those fleeing from the war cannot be the burden of Italy alone. It is time to stop talking. The European Union needs to make its presence felt. We cannot accept the fact that Italy is filled with illegal immigrants, while France rejects them so shamefully. The illegal immigrants should be sent back home, while all Member States must now commit themselves to receiving the Libyan refugees.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, what we are now witnessing in Lampedusa was described and predicted as early as in 1973 by the French writer, Jean Raspail, in his prophetic novel The Camp of the Saints . The only difference is that reality is surpassing fiction.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe needs to take control of this situation instead of just letting it happen. It is absurd to first applaud regime change in Tunisia and Egypt and to then immediately accept migrants en masse , or, more precisely, so-called refugees, from those countries. Everybody knows that virtually no one on those boats, which are mooring in Lampedusa, is eligible to be recognised as a political refugee. However, those people are now being allowed into European territory and, with the support of all kinds of subsidised groups, human traffickers and expensive lawyers, they will be starting procedures, drawing them out as long as possible and, if need be, going underground if they are not recognised as refugees.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Judging by current events, Frontex is not protecting the external borders of Europe; it is treating them as a sort of welcoming committee. Those boats should be escorted back to the places they are coming from and genuine refugees should, as far as possible, be accepted in their own region instead of in Europe. It is also of fundamental importance that a number of international conventions are adapted to the needs of today.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to speak and to use this debate to talk about a fundamental issue: the emergency. They cannot cope alone.</p>
      <p sl="es">The root of this problem is, as everybody knows, in the unstable situations in Tunisia and Egypt, and the war in Libya. However, there is no limit to how long it will last: unfortunately, it will last a worrying length of time. We therefore need to decide how we can use our common policies to manage the emergency, because they cannot cope alone.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my opinion, Madam President, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims and solidarity with the host states and regions must be our priority.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have instruments that we are not using properly. We have four funds. Mrs Malmström told us clearly and briskly about sums that strike me as ridiculous. She spoke of EUR 30 million, EUR 25 million on request, etc. However, our four funds, the Refugee Fund, the Return Fund, the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund, total almost EUR 3 billion within the scope of the financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mrs Malmström, it seems to me that these funds should be used for emergency situations, because we need to have the ability to use them and modify them. Our limitations in terms of collaboration and solidarity are symbolised by the fragility that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has demonstrated with the Hermes Operation. The arrival of increasing numbers of people fleeing the war and fleeing from desperation highlight how limited this capacity is. They cannot cope alone.</p>
      <p sl="es">Who can cope? The European Union has the necessary solidarity to meet the requirements of this emergency in real time.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the Provera report could not have come at a more challenging time. Tunisia and Egypt, countries with enormous economic problems, have already opened their doors to more than 400 000 refugees from Libya. Despite this, European governments have chosen to whistle in the wind and ignore the 20 000 people amassing in Lampedusa in sub-human conditions. The revolutions in North Africa have made it even more pressing for European Union Member States to fulfil their humanitarian obligations to take in refugees, and to set out a new migration policy based on solidarity, and on the other fundamental values and principles of the European Union. The closed door and forced return policies used by some Member States over the last few years in relation to their Mediterranean neighbours may have prevented some migrants from reaching Europe, by means of increased controls within North African ports, patrols in the Mediterranean and even some more brutal methods, such as electric shocks. However, this has been at a scandalously high cost: the rights of migrants and refugees, forcibly returned to regimes such as Gaddafi’s.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The current emergency requires the adoption of a common asylum system, with shared responsibilities including a temporary protection mechanism and much more resettlement on offer. We need a new migration strategy that takes into account the original causes of migration, such as poverty, discrimination, conflict and political repression, among other things. Without this, traffickers will always manage to find alternative routes. The promotion of human rights, democracy and sustainable development therefore need to become a real strategic priority within the European Union’s foreign policy, and within development programmes for the Mediterranean and beyond.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the emergency situation is teaching the European policy on asylum and immigration a serious lesson It is again evident that the EU does not have a legislative and operational framework that enables it to cope with extraordinary but not unforeseeable events, such as the events of recent months in North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lampedusa, Italy and Southern Italy are paying for these mistakes, but the main ones to pay are the refugees who are received in such an inhumane manner. Despite Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and the principle of equitable sharing of solidarity, all the countries are actually concerned only with their own affairs and the attitude of France, which shares a border with Italy, is unacceptable in the current European scenario. In this regard, I urge the Commission to consider the possibility of seeking an explanation from the French Government.</p>
      <p sl="it">For years, the EU has entered into agreements with third countries run by dictatorships, funding their activities and putting business interests before democratic requirements. Europe has remained silent before the Libyan raids: does it also intend to remain silent in the face of the unsustainable situation of the tent camps?</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, we all agree that we cannot make deals with Colonel Gaddafi, yet, a few months ago, I did not hear any objections to the Italy-Libya treaty, which has led to the immigration issue being addressed in the most inhuman way. Today, President Berlusconi tried to use the same approach with Tunisia, offering money. Perhaps, though, the new Tunisian Government has learned its lesson.</p>
      <p sl="it">Yet, like it or not, it is the responsibility of the EU and the 27 Member States to take action, bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights. For this reason, I hope that the European Commission proposes the introduction of the emergency procedure laid down in Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection as soon as possible, and that this proposal is adopted by the Council in the near future, because otherwise it will be in vain.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also call for a parliamentary delegation, not a delegation of political groups, to be sent to Lampedusa to verify both the humanitarian conditions of the immigrants and the non-refoulement principle.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, this report is sensitive, and I must criticise its title. The use of the words ‘migration flows’ sets the tone: it gives the impression that migrants are commodities or invaders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are historic times for the peoples of the Southern Mediterranean and us, but the fear of mass immigration is preventing the EU and the Member States from creating a new dynamic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The recent democratic movements in the South have helped make us aware of our contradictions. They have demonstrated once again the inconsistency and lack of vision of our obsolete and out-of-touch cooperation policies. It is high time the European Union implemented a migration policy that is consistent with our values, that recognises that we live in a world in which people are mobile, a world in which human beings move around.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To continue to talk about migration flows is absurd and goes against our humanist values. If we Europeans want to be major players in the world, then we have to change our approach and work towards creating a solidarity-based Union for the Mediterranean; we cannot do so without revising mobility policy, or what is today referred to as migration policy. We must meet the expectations of the peoples of the South.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fear of immigration must no longer guide our policies. Strengthening border controls must no longer be our main motivation in implementing cooperation agreements, as it was in the case of Libya.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must review the conditions necessary for any signing of agreements on the movement of persons involving readmission agreements, so that we respect human rights. Our actions are still characterised by a security-driven approach to mobility, which goes against our values and the requirement we have to protect populations. The scandalous position adopted by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Guéant must be vigorously denounced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, what kind of policy must we adopt in order to establish a true Union for the Mediterranean, one in which we show solidarity with the peoples of the South, who today feel scorned by us?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will not be voting for this report. It does admittedly contain some positive points, but they are constantly contradicted by the practices of certain Member States, including my own country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report refuses to see that migration is primarily a South-South issue. The failure to recognise this means that tensions will simply increase and will plunge a number of those countries a little further into poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">True, the European Union cannot accommodate all the destitute people in the world, but it is in no danger of having to do so; the figures are there to prove it, regardless of the fuss some people are making. The European Union cannot accommodate all the destitute people in the world, but it should make a contribution that is in proportion to its wealth, its needs and the damage that it has caused and that is still being caused today by some of its companies, which are plundering those countries’ resources. This report remains in the tradition of this inward-looking fortress Europe, in defiance of its own interests, particularly its demographic ones.</p>
      <p sl="fr">No, the European Union has not learnt from the revolutions taking place in the Arab states. It is not showing solidarity. In the space of a few days, the Tunisians have accommodated more than 100 000 Libyan refugees in exemplary conditions. No, Commissioner, Europe’s talk is no match for the problems facing the world. It will only fuel the xenophobic policies of certain Member States, and I regret that.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her hard work week after week in dealing with this epic disaster – because that is what it is.</p>
      <p sl="it">Comments have been made, not only in this House, in an attempt to reduce and make light of what our government, our country and our people have had to face. It has been, and continues to be, an emergency –humanitarian and otherwise – of exceptional dimensions. I believe that our government, and especially our people, have really come out of this well in terms of international public opinion. The people of Lampedusa behaved remarkably in firstly welcoming the migrants and then helping them out of their own pockets, and then, at a certain point, they said ‘we cannot do this any more’, because in addition to the human rights we discuss every day in this House, we must also consider the rights of peoples, including their right to maintain their identity, their activities and, naturally, not to be invaded.</p>
      <p sl="it">The migrants also include illegal immigrants, criminals released from prison. This rightly concerns the countries that must accept them. Furthermore, when the migration takes on the dimension – I repeat – of an invasion, we need to face up to the issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are one hundred per cent with our people, no ifs or buts. The European Union must stand up and take note, Commissioner. In addition to human rights, we must consider our rights, the rights of indigenous peoples. For this reason, we fully endorse the efforts being made by Italian Government at the moment in Tunisia, because compared to the modest figures announced by the Commissioner, the Italian Government is offering Tunisia a lot. A lot is being done and we are confident we will achieve tangible results</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we must move from words to deeds and Frontex is not doing what should have been done to put an end to this hateful traffic, because this traffic is the shame of the Mediterranean and the European Union is partly responsible. Therefore, I say put a stop to people trafficking and I say yes to a Marshall Plan for these countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mrs Malmström, it is well known that people from over-populated, under-developed countries risk their lives every day because the EU, with its pseudo-humanitarian ideas, has not made it clear that the rules that apply to migrants are not the same as those that apply to refugees.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, refugees are, as we all know, people who, owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion or political opinion, are outside the country of their nationality. However, this definition does not apply to the vast majority of people who flood into Europe on a daily basis. Regardless of the situation in their home country, they just want to go somewhere in the EU – to the land that, in their mind, is flowing with milk and honey – in order to try their luck here and usually only in order to be included in our social systems. This may perhaps make sense in their eyes, but as members of the European Parliament, we have to serve the interests of Europeans. This certainly does not include permanently supporting millions of economic migrants who, with a lack of training and qualifications suitable for our labour market, are simply not much use to us.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would also be extremely unfair to countries like Tunisia and Libya in particular, which are only just freeing themselves from dictatorial regimes and starting out on the road to democracy and which will need all the strength they have to rebuild their own countries. These people must develop their own countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since the end of the Ben Ali dictatorship, Tunisia has been a free country. This situation must also be taken into consideration here in the EU in the discussions about how to deal with the mass influx of people from North Africa. Therefore, all economic migrants should, in my view, be sent back even before they reach Europe. They should not even be allowed to arrive in Lampedusa, and the EU agency Frontex should be given the appropriate powers by us to ensure that they do not.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a series of measures and initiatives that are certainly reassuring and also along the lines requested by the Italian delegation in the meeting that we had last week together with the head of the delegation with President Barroso: more solidarity, more means, more specifics and more incisive action for Lampedusa, Malta and all the States that are exposed to exceptional migratory pressures that can only be tackled through European governance.</p>
      <p sl="it">These reassuring statements are naturally consistent with our thoughts on the application of Article 5 of Directive 2001/55/EC. We trust that this can be brought before the Council within an entirely reasonable timeframe. A more coherent European Neighbourhood Policy, based on results and on a policy of primacy in favour of border regions that can spend resources to ensure that their own young people can achieve work and growth opportunities in their own lands. A better and more adequate operational plan for Frontex, which has actually made itself useful by carrying out joint patrols during this exceptional stage. We believe that the section on funding for migration allows for the possibility of further action due to the exceptional state of affairs of which everyone is now well aware.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner Malmström, we have not mentioned countervailing measures. Commissioner Hahn is not with you, and it would probably have been helpful if he had been. A review of Structural Funds, a policy that takes account of an exceptional situation, the reduction in attractiveness, the penalising of the attractiveness of the region of Sicily with regard to fishing and tourism, for which Lampedusa and Sicily must somehow be compensated.</p>
      <p sl="it">One hundred and fifty thousand Egyptians have returned to Libya, but this migration issue does not end here. For this reason, we must act very firmly through a strong and decisive European policy and we trust that you and President Barroso can develop that strategy through a comprehensive migration plan. We cannot wait for any more measures and we are confident that by the end of this month, Europe will come up with a migration plan, in the interest of the long-awaited solidarity that we want to see put into action at last.</p>

      <p sl="en">A human tragedy is actually taking place as we speak in this House. In many cases, we are talking about whether we agree or disagree, but one thing that we should be in agreement about is that this tragedy, which is on our doorstep – a few hundred kilometres from the European Union’s southern frontier – is taking place right now, and will continue to grow. Yet we continue to debate, even when there is a tool – Council Directive 2001/55/EC – which, on a recommendation from the Commission, can be set in motion by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">How are we going to measure whether the influx is high, not high or high enough when it is all over? The European Union has to decide whether it wants to act or react. We react when things have already occurred. Let us not be the man of yesterday. Let us be today’s institution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, efficient management, coherence, solidarity, responsibility: these are supposed to be the foundations of an EU common immigration policy. Contrast this with the actual record of the EU over the last decade, which deserves a score of about three out of ten. This is not the fault of the Commission, which has produced a stream of policies and proposed laws, but largely of the Member States. It is time to get off the reactive and chaotic back foot and onto the proactive, well-managed front foot. Maybe we could benefit from looking at a country like Canada, and especially its policies on legal migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">My own state, the United Kingdom, has stood apart from any idea of a common policy. I regret that, but when so many of those interviewed in places like Lampedusa say they want to move on quickly northwards and often specifically to the United Kingdom, it does not help persuade my country, which has had very large immigration itself, to lift its border controls.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe in solidarity. I believe that the Temporary Protection Directive should be invoked now. However, there does have to be responsibility on all Member States – those in the north and also those in the south – to properly implement EU law on the reception of migrants and on the processing of claims with financial and other help, and also on integration and the enforcement of labour laws.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I do not think that we can welcome the revolution in Tunisia, on the one hand, and demand that the country implements the border control policy that existed in the days of the Ben Ali dictatorship, on the other. I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government, which has many other matters to attend to: its own refugees – as has been said – and overseeing its democratic transition process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The situation, then, is a new and exceptional one, and this should perhaps enable us to think up appropriate solutions while at the same time showing solidarity. Baroness Ludford is right – that is what is definitely lacking the most within the European Union. I think that the work of the European Commission, and of Parliament, could consist firstly in declaring a moratorium on the return of Tunisians, because that really is improper and inappropriate. We should also grant exceptional permission to reside to Tunisians who have already arrived in France and Italy, guarantee access to Europe to people seeking protection, and refrain from taking any steps or concluding any agreements that might get in the way of that protection, apply the provisions – as has been said – of the 2001 directive to all those eligible to take advantage of them, and accommodate refugees present at the border between Tunisia and Libya as part of the resettlement process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, I believe that we must think about forging cooperative links with these future fully democratic countries, so that Tunisians can come and work, study and travel perfectly legally, so as to create real channels of mobility between the two shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I believe that Lampedusa has become a symbol of the inhumanity of the European Union’s immigration policy. This is not a just an immediate problem; it is a structural problem.</p>
      <p sl="es">I remember 14 February 2009, during the previous parliamentary session. I went to Lampedusa with a delegation from my parliamentary group. It was a journey into hell; into hell, I say! That migration policy was not based on the understanding that emigration is a right and not a crime, and it did nothing to guarantee the sacred principle of the right to request asylum.</p>
      <p sl="es">In Lampedusa, in 2009, nothing was done to identify people or to process asylum requests until the people did what they had to do: rise up, mutiny, because they were living like animals.</p>
      <p sl="es">Between 2009 and 2011, nothing has changed. In fact, it could be said that something did change: President Berlusconi signed an agreement with Colonel Gaddafi in spite of the fact that Colonel Gaddafi was not complying with international law and expelled the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees knowing that he had 9 000 refugees in Libya; the same Libya that is currently being bombed after a humanitarian appeal.</p>

      <p sl="en">That single sentence contains two completely contradictory ideas. How do you protect civilians from attack without occupying any piece of territory in order to do so? How can nations with long and illustrious military histories, such as Britain and France, adopt such a nonsensical policy? The answer to that is simple: they are bound to do so by the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, as a result of the Lisbon Treaty. They no longer control their own foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council decision goes on to say that responsibility for the Union’s military policy lies with the High Representative of Common Foreign and Security Policy.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Mrs Costa, you are right, I am using harsh words, but those words are very clear. We in the European Union are now having to deal with a huge influx of refugees and the majority on the left are saying that these are just unfortunate people, all of whom are fleeing their countries. Fine, but why do they all have to come to Europe? I think it is more difficult to reach Europe in a boat than it is to reach Morocco or Saudi Arabia. Obviously, they are coming here because of our social services and because they will be able to get money from the government here. You are just allowing all of that!</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must act firmly against this and we need to ensure that, as Members of the European Parliament, we stand up for the citizens of the European Union. If you stick to this line of thinking, it will be our downfall. Next, we will be looking to sub-Saharan Africa and, eventually, everyone will be coming here. We cannot afford that. That is your world, but not mine. I wish you every success with that, but that is not what our citizens want, certainly not in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, a few days ago, EU leaders announced that they stand ready to show concrete solidarity with those Member States most affected by migratory pressures. Well, that time has come, because the mass movement has now hit the European Union. We now call on the European Council to honour its word. And for solidarity to be concrete, it must mean that all Member States shoulder responsibility for the displaced people who are fleeing Libya towards Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a tool already; we just need to use it. It is the solidarity mechanism envisaged in Directive 2001/55/EC, which does two things. Firstly, it gives temporary protection to all displaced people who reach the EU. Secondly, it puts the responsibility to host them on all Member States and not just on the country that they happen to arrive in. The mechanism is triggered by a Council decision stating that the mass influx exists. However, it must come on a proposal from the Commission – from you, Madam Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that there is a mass exodus leaving Libya. More than 400 000 people have fled Libya, mostly to Tunisia and Egypt, but also now to EU countries. Last week, more than 800 people, mostly Somalis and Eritreans, arrived in Malta in just twenty-four hours. Proportionally speaking, this has the same impact as 120 000 arriving in France in just one day. Surely this would qualify as a mass influx. So it is not the numbers in absolute terms that we need to look at, but the numbers in relative terms – their relative impact on the country of arrival.</p>
      <p sl="en">I really appeal to you, Madam Commissioner, to take the political leadership and make this proposal. I also appeal to the Council to honour its word and show concrete solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Council has refused to create an asylum policy and real formal burden-sharing since 1999. Speaking on behalf of David Sassoli and my Italian colleagues, what we see in Italy today is an emergency which has no real solution in law. A solution should have been found by now. Reception procedures, qualifications – the core of the asylum package which we are discussing today – should have been implemented long ago. We would then have had a concept of resettlement and a concept of burden-sharing, but we do not.</p>
      <p sl="en">For that reason, I say on behalf of my group that we must assist in this emergency. We call on the Council in particular – but also on you, Commissioner – to show that political leadership, and to apply Council Directive 2001/55/EC. That will create a situation of resettlement which may at least alleviate some of the burden.</p>
      <p sl="en">As well as doing that – as some have said – we cannot ignore our duties in relation to asylum and to international law. Those duties will apply to so many people who are vulnerable and suffering today. The reasons for the push factors of asylum are deep and profound – they are poverty and instability. However, we have a situation right now affecting the Southern countries and we need to implement Council Directive 2001/55/EC.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to address three points. Firstly, we should make it clear that we are indeed able to provide assistance to refugees from North Africa, particularly from Tunisia, and that we also want to do so. I therefore also welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to activate Directive 2001/55/EC for giving temporary protection and I would, at the same time, call for all Member States to actually utilise this, not only Italy, but also France and Germany – above all, the countries that are actually in a position to invest.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we expect a clear statement from the Commission to the effect that any agreements entered into with dictators like Ben Ali or Gaddafi concerning the prevention of migration – that is how I would describe them – are null and void. Genuine partnerships with third countries, like Mrs Malmström mentioned, are probably not comparable with Italy’s idea of buying the readiness to take back refugees with EUR 150 million. Instead of showing solidarity in respect of the prevention of refugees, we should be showing practical solidarity with North African States like Tunisia, to which 150 000 people have fled.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we need to understand how fragile the ground is on which the EU refugee prevention instruments are standing. Frontex and Dublin II – we need a rethink where these are concerned. We need liberal asylum and migration legislation in Europe and a different development policy that is genuinely sustainable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, at this stage of our debate, I am inevitably going to have to repeat or to support some of the things that have been said previously. However, like several of my fellow Members, I also wanted to say that the problems that we are having to face – problems which the whole of the European Union is having to face at the moment – cannot be resolved by one Member State alone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">No Member State should have to rise alone to the challenges that it is facing and that, once again, the European Union as a whole, I believe, is facing. The ability of the European Union to organise itself and to handle the situation by working together and as one is therefore really what I am asking for. I believe that the time has truly come now to lay the foundations of a true European immigration and asylum policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A European asylum and immigration pact was adopted over a year ago. The time has come now, I think, to apply it in a very concrete fashion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We heard the Commissioner; we heard a number of the recommendations that she was making. I would like to come back to them and to support very strongly some of her proposals. Yes, we must increase Frontex’s resources at all costs. We must increase its human, material and financial resources, and we must ensure that it can provide greater support to Operation Hermes and Operation Poseidon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, we need extra, additional resources for those Member States that are principally affected, I would say, by the increased migration flows that we are seeing today. That will be the financial expression of our solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, we need to forge closer cooperative links with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean; we need to support them, of course, help them, and find instruments. The Commissioner mentioned – I believe that she travelled to Tunisia to speak on this issue – mobility partnerships. Yes, we need to strengthen those instruments in a spirit of responsibility, in a spirit of solidarity, but also in a spirit of real, specific action.</p>

To introduce and empower a European immigration policy, we must do together what others cannot do, in other words, achieve the consensus of governments.</p>
      <p sl="it">Take your proposals and put them before the Council. We shall support you, because you must have realised, apart from some xenophobic remarks, that you enjoy great respect and great solidarity in this House.

      <p sl="it">Tomorrow, we will do our bit in Parliament.

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, we have all been saying how we are faced with an increase in migratory flows, in terms of both scale and complexity. Chronic conflict situations in Afghanistan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are now being joined by an alarming increase in new cases, such as Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, which have led to a dramatic worsening of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Member States which, for geographical reasons, have been more affected by these migratory pressures, have also seen their ability to respond considerably reduced. The chaotic situation on the island of Lampedusa, which several speakers have already mentioned, is one example, with the number of refugees exceeding the number of residents. The Member States that are particularly affected therefore urgently need to receive the necessary support, through the provision of financial, human and technical resources, in order to ensure they are actually able to respond to the massive migratory flows, and to be able to respond with humanity to the human pressure with which we are faced.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore support the call made by my fellow Members for the European Union solidarity mechanism to be activated immediately. It is also important to take advantage of existing infrastructure and bodies, such as the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the European Asylum Support Office, and, probably, to reassess and adapt Operation Hermes. I also agree with what Mr Tavares has already said about the process for resettling refugees. It is important that the Council, which is not present for this debate, stops hiding behind legal pretexts and is able to bring this matter of refugee resettlement to a successful conclusion. Lastly, Commissioner, I believe that we need more solidarity between the Member States of the Union, improved coordination of efforts, and a sharing of responsibilities and burdens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to note that sometimes, the West can find great solidarity when it comes to bombing, sending companies into third world countries and taking oil, but finds it more of a struggle to make solidarity and migration policies. This evening’s debate touches on these themes.</p>
      <p sl="it">I went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 people on the ground, huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain, doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes – which some have said were designer labels, but are, in fact, fake designer labels – they had on during the crossing, in lamentable conditions. Among these were 4 500 children, 12-13 year-old kids, living under the same conditions, conditions of discomfort shared also by the inhabitants of Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tunisia is now home to 150 000 migrants who come from Libya and shows its solidarity. It is a poor country showing solidarity, while wealthy Europe is unable to accommodate 5 000 migrants. Europe should instead show its solidarity to these wonderful kids who have sparked the Jasmine Revolution originating in Sidi Bouzid that is changing North Africa and the world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, your words are in line with what we wanted to hear. I would not, however, like to ideologise this debate which is sometimes ideologised in a bipartisan manner. I believe that it is a very serious matter to speak of a humanitarian emergency.</p>
      <p sl="it">The question I ask myself, and that I also address to my fellow MEPs, is as follows: ‘Can we speak of humanitarian emergency and stop at that point, or should we ask two types of questions, one about the emergency and thus about the immediate issues, and another about strategy?’</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem of Africa and the Middle East is a problem that must, by definition, lie outside Europe, and the question that arises is whether there can be development without democracy. Let us remember that the revolt in these countries of the Middle East and the Mediterranean has not been about ideology but about bread, a revolt for democracy in order to survive.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are bound to ask ourselves certain questions about this. It is all very well, Commissioner, to address the problem of Directive 2001/55/EC and everything that Frontex is doing, but Europe must ask itself what it wants to do about the Mediterranean and the whole of Africa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many of my fellow Members have spoken of Libya and other countries. This makes me think of Darfur, of certain situations where genocide goes on every day in Africa. The only discordant note I would add is this: it is not true that Europe is responsible for looting. Of course, some European countries are partly responsible, but in Africa, a number of capitalist systems interact that are not based on the social economy of labour, like our own, but are based on the state economy, state capitalism. The leading example is China, which buys sovereign debts and exploits entire populations. We cannot go and oust presidents who are driven by crime. Even the UN cannot do this.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that we should leave aside the ideological issues and think about the immediate problem, and that means welcoming these people, all of them together. Tomorrow, though, we cannot avoid discussing Europe’s strategy towards the whole of Africa.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, we have come to the end of the speeches, so I am going to focus on two points in the form of questions. Firstly, the humanitarian chaos in the Mediterranean is the inevitable consequence of the shortcomings, indeed of the lack of a common migration policy, within the European Union. To seek merely to prevent migration flows bound for Europe is unrealistic, and it means that, today, third countries and Member States in southern Europe are alone having to suffer the consequences. The Italian response – collective expulsions – is not acceptable, and neither is the French position of closing the borders; it resolves nothing and simply overlooks the real issues at stake.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My first question is this: can we expect a shake-up and the development of a balanced European migration policy?</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second question concerns European solidarity also; I do not see it as a slogan but as something that has become an urgent and absolute necessity. I, too, urge the Council to respond urgently and activate the solidarity mechanism provided for by the directive on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx, but I also urge the Member States to respond to the UNHCR’s appeal for the urgent resettlement mechanism to be applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, my second question is: can we expect concrete action at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 11 and 12 April?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I believe that today’s debate on the Provera report is welcome in view of recent events in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. I wish to begin by emphasising the need for an EU-level approach to managing the migration flows triggered by the wave of revolution in the Arab world, in the spirit of solidarity required by Article 80 of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I wish to congratulate Mr Provera for his report which underlines the need to take into account consistently the deep-rooted causes of the instability which is the source of the migration flows. Plenty of events are going on at the moment, reminding us of the urgent need for action. In the wake of the post-election conflict in Côte d’Ivoire, for example, hundreds of thousands of Ivorians sought refuge in neighbouring countries, including 94 000 of them in Liberia alone, a country itself threatened by instability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to escape this spiral of instability and migration, I think that we need to emphasise, above all, the preventive aspect. By this I am primarily thinking of preventing conflicts. We must also consider promoting democracy and human rights, as well as, of course, improving the economic situation in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Then again, in my view, we need to make better use of the instruments we have available as part of the global approach to migration in order to encourage synergy between migration and development. The issue of migration must automatically feature in the dialogue with Europe’s partners. Efforts must also be stepped up in supporting development projects in the countries of origin and transit, which improve living conditions and these countries’ ability to manage migration flows.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything is uncertain as regards the situation in North Africa. We do not know the immediate outcome of the civil war in Libya, we do not know whether the new political order in the Maghreb countries and Egypt will be conducive to democracy, or whether even worse conditions will arise with regard to democracy and relations with Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">As for the arrival of an unstoppable stream of fugitives from the shores of Africa onto European shores and those of Lampedusa in particular, it is difficult, even in this case, to distinguish those who are fleeing from violence and fear of death, those who have, for example, escaped from prison, and those who are looking for a future that holds better things than the hunger in their country.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can nevertheless be sure of certain things. Firstly, human dignity must be respected in all human beings. Secondly, the European approach is to offer hospitality to all refugees. Thirdly, the borders of the individual states which form part of the European Union are the borders of Europe. Fourthly, there is a duty of solidarity among all European countries that are part of the Union: this was confirmed, strengthened and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon, which also governs migration policy and the management of migratory flows in an area of freedom, security and justice. Fifthly, the instruments for coping with emergencies such as the current one are already in place, in the form of Directive 2001/55/EC, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The current situation is one of those situations that reveals whether Europe actually is or is not a reality.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, I greatly enjoyed your speech, but I think we should move from words to deeds. I am well aware of this and I know you will act. We hope that your proposal will be followed up. The important thing is that words are not enough: we need deeds to make Europe a reality. This is an opportunity to build Europe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we are at a turning point. I say this, because we need to consider how we intend to move forward, beyond the crisis facing us at the moment. We managed, in previous years, to limit migration flows from North Africa to southern Europe, to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Malta and Greece, through bilateral agreements between these countries and the corresponding countries in North Africa, and we really did achieve significant results. That is why there is now more pressure on Greece via Turkey, because Europe and Greece have been unable to apply similar agreements with Turkey, despite the fact that such bilateral agreements exist.</p>
      <p sl="el">My question therefore is this: now that all this disruption has broken out, what is to become of these agreements, Commissioner? Could we – and should we – link these prior agreements or other future agreements to the financing we provide? The package of measures you announced is very good and we must help these countries. It is our duty to help all our fellow men; however, this must be linked with an obligation on the part of these countries to take back everyone who has arrived in Lampedusa and everyone who arrives in the immediate or more distant future in other European countries, because the greater the pressure, the more people will arrive in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">While we are on the subject and as Directive 2001/55/EC has been raised, perhaps we should review what we were saying a year ago; several Members have referred to the famous reallocation that we have awaited so anxiously. We are still waiting to apply repatriation and resettlement; please tell us what else we should do. Perhaps, however, we should start straight away with the internal resettlement of refugees, so as to relieve the pressure on the countries which face a real problem?</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, because my time has run out, we must limit fragmentary approaches by the Member States. Some countries, such as Germany and France, are selectively suspending returns under Dublin II to Greece. We may face the same problem with Italy in the immediate or more distant future. The Greek Government has come along and announced another fragmentary approach: a fence in Evros, but we have no overall solution to the problem. This is such a vital issue that we need real solidarity and an overall strategy, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, the original plan was for this debate to be much narrower, covering only the Provera report. The Conference of Presidents decided to extend its scope, and so we are now discussing – and quite rightly too – current reactions to the influx of people who are, for the most part, refugees. For we cannot call them illegal immigrants, because they are refugees – from Syria and, above all, from North Africa, which is currently engulfed in revolutionary turmoil. Our debate is now also focusing on an overall assessment of the European Union’s current asylum and immigration policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on the Provera report, however, I would like to return to this document. I would like to raise two issues in connection with it, which, in my opinion, are absolutely vital. Firstly, I would like to say how much I welcome the fact that the report discusses the need for greater synergy between two key pillars of European policy, namely, development and security. The lesson we are learning today from the revolutionary events in North Africa tells us that aid provided only via official channels and distributed by the departments of dictator-led governments does not solve the social problems of people living in countries covered by EU aid policy. EU aid must genuinely help ordinary people to solve social problems, instead of lining the pockets of dictators and those in power.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Not only economic reform, but also reform in terms of democracy and human rights should be a prerequisite for the granting of development aid. Today, we are seeing that young people from those parts of the world in which we are interested and which are covered by our development policy not only want bread, but also freedom and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, in view of the demographic challenges facing Europe, it is becoming clear that the European Union will not cope with the problems already appearing on the horizon for the labour market without a coherent and genuinely rational immigration policy. The only thing that can prevent the influx into Europe of the least educated and most needy migrants looking for their place in the world is a well thought-out and coherent migration policy, as previous speakers have mentioned, such as those operated by Canada and New Zealand.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Mediterranean basin, and the current and foreseeable migratory flows, require the adoption of a medium- and long-term strategy different from the one announced by Commissioner Malmström.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it is necessary to create democratic living and development conditions in African countries bordering the Mediterranean that will prevent the kind of migration we are witnessing. I therefore believe we need a special plan in the short term – some have defined it as a Marshall Plan – to stimulate and implement a process of development in the countries of North Africa. Only in this way can we stop and prevent future migration.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to underline the need for compensatory measures in the areas involved. All the speakers talked of Lampedusa, but I would like to invite you to reflect on what the kind of migratory process we are experiencing at present really means for an island that lives on tourism and fishing. Tour operators have not received any bookings for months but only cancellations. Europe must show its support with appropriate compensatory measures.</p>

      <p sl="it">As we speak, unseaworthy vessels continue to sail the Mediterranean to the Italian coast, their passengers often paying with their lives. Despite the recent transfers, Lampedusa remains in a situation of absolute emergency and people are still streaming into the tent city of Manduria.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy continues to play its part in taking in these desperate people, while other countries are remarkable only for the number of expulsions taking place through their police stations. Our government is in Tunis attempting to limit to this flow, but we cannot continue to go it alone. We need the European Union, we need assistance and we need the political role of Europe to plan a new neighbourhood policy and a more efficient strategy on migration, starting from the failure of the Dublin system and the observation that Lampedusa is not only the border of Italy but also that of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an elected representative from Southern Italy, I join the chorus of fellow MEPs who have preceded me in calling for appropriate action to address the critical situation faced by citizens and migrants in Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="it">The health and sanitation situation on the island has exceeded all limits of decency. I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Italian Government to ensure it adopts all measures available to it, and call on the European Commission to implement the measures provided for in the EU Directive on temporary protection for immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="it">The next European Council of Ministers of the Interior, scheduled for 11 April, must take appropriate measures to ensure that neither the migrants nor the citizens of Lampedusa are left in a desperate condition. We therefore need to initiate a serious debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy which will focus on initiatives to support the path to democracy, especially in the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean. I congratulate Mr Provera.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we know that, in order to solve immigration problems, there is a need to support the development of immigrants’ countries of origin, without outside interference, but with concrete action promoting solidarity, respect for human rights and the defence of peace, whether in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya or any other country. Nevertheless, this is not what is happening, a sad example of which is the situation in Lampedusa. There is an urgent need for serious measures; solidarity measures; measures that will bring this tragedy to an end. I would like, Commissioner, to draw particular attention to the situation of immigrant women. There is a need to guarantee such women the right to their own passport and residency permit, which is also important for combating human trafficking, in particular, that of women and children; support for the resettlement of refugees also needs to be linked to this. Finally, I challenge the Commission to review the Return Directive as soon as possible: a directive that is against immigrants fleeing war, hunger and misery, whose only wish is to be happy with their families, and who deserve our solidarity.</p>

Events illustrate that we will not resolve the question of immigration and that it will continue. We cannot eliminate it, but we must manage it. Greece, Italy and Spain cannot deal with it alone, because these countries are under severe pressure. We have failed to address the problem since 1990. We consider that it does not exist, we leave the Member States to their fate and these poor people are being exploited, as are the natives of Europe suffering this burden.

In a discussion with his comrades, the Georgian murderer said something which would cause a stir. It is not important who votes in the party and how. What is of paramount importance is who counts the votes. As a result, it will come as no surprise to us, for instance, that Nursultan Nazarbayev was recently re-elected in Kazakhstan with more than 95% of the votes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is the same story in Romania where absolutely every election is rigged. This charade for democracy is orchestrated by the local mafia under the direct protection of the US Embassy in Romania, which actually decides what is better for the Romanian people.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, this debate is taking place at a critical time for the future of the European Neighbourhood Policy. In this context, I believe that the incidents which Italy has encountered in Lampedusa highlight the need to devise an EU migration policy focused on the following areas.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Firstly, the EU should focus on the causes of migration flows. By this I mean the precarious economic situation and unstable political climate in the countries of origin. By creating jobs and increasing investments in these countries, the Union would encourage their citizens to become involved in their own community.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, I believe that migrants’ rights need to be protected. It is the duty of the Frontex agency, in particular, to implement the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the other international treaties in this area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the debate this evening has been characterised by the use of the word ‘solidarity’. All too often in this Chamber, Members speak in their own national interests, but it might be better if more of us spoke about concerns in other countries, to show solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reason I asked for the floor was that I was very struck by the numbers used by my colleague, Simon Busuttil, of 800 people arriving into Malta being the equivalent of 120 000 arriving into France on one single day. The problems of Malta and of Lampedusa are European Union problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I talked extensively about the idea of solidarity during the Lisbon Treaty debate. We need to debate the concept of solidarity in this Parliament because I fear that solidarity is sundered in the European Union at the moment, not just on this difficult issue, but on many others. It is time that we, as a Parliament, grappled with it and put European Union solidarity back on the map.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is indeed a challenging situation. North Africa is, of course, facing a challenge. The people there are now trying, especially in Tunisia and Egypt, to build new countries – democratic countries where there is respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law. They are preparing for elections later this summer. We should do everything to support them in this fantastic journey.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is, as you know, preparing a revised strategy for the neighbourhood and it will be presented to the Council. It will contain support for democracy, support for economic development, growth and job opportunities, and there will also be an element of mobility. This is a challenge for which we should provide our support.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have a challenge in Libya, where the increased violence is creating a very insecure situation and forcing many people to flee. It is a challenge for European migration policy. In the long term, we need to develop a more global approach to this, very much in line with Mr Provera’s report, the input of which will be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the short term, we, of course, need to conclude the asylum package. Believe me, Mrs Keller, we are trying to do that. With the help of the European Parliament and the efforts of the different rapporteurs to get the package together and conclude the negotiation with the Parliament, I still hope that we can finalise this before the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a challenging facing Lampedusa and Malta. I would like to reject some allegations that the Commission, or ‘Brussels’, has not been engaged in helping Italy. We have, in fact, offered assistance to Italy. For the remaining period under the current long-term budget, there is EUR 171 million in the national envelope for Italy. Some of that money has not yet been used for Italy, and we have been working with the Italian authorities on an almost daily basis to see how programme financing can be reallocated so that it can be used to address the situation in Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also offered Italy assistance to reimburse some of the costs of internal transfers of migrants. We have the Frontex Hermes operation, but I would like to remind you that Frontex depends on the contribution of the Member States, and that will be running out in a very short time. We have the answer: we have Europol in place. We are engaged in talks with Tunisia to seek a solution on an organised, dignified, voluntary return of those people who are not in need of international protection. We are helping Tunisia to fight the trafficking networks and seeing how we can assist it in building up border control. This is part of a larger mobility partnership.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most of the refugees are in Tunisia and Egypt. As I said, more than 400 000 people have left Libya. Most of these people have been repatriated. They are mainly Tunisians and Egyptians, but they also come from about 30 different countries, mainly in Africa. There are also people from Bangladesh, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most of these people have been repatriated through European assistance, with the Member States working in a true spirit of solidarity with Tunisia and Egypt. But there are some people remaining. I visited these refugee camps only a few days ago. The Tunisians are doing impressive work together with international organisations, such as the UNHCR. But there are a few people there, a few thousand, who are stranded. They cannot return home. We need to assist these people. They need to be resettled in Europe. It is very difficult for me to explain to these Somalis that you cannot come to Europe because we have not agreed on delegated or implemented acts. So please, I urge you and the Council to come to an agreement on this, because we could really fulfil the aim of the European resettlement programme and help those people, because they have nowhere to go.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also seeing refugees coming to Europe now – to Lampedusa and to Malta. I realise that Malta, of course, with the size of the island, is under enormous pressure. We might see more people coming. Many of these people might be in need of international protection. As long as the violence goes on in Libya, the risk of more people having to flee will increase.</p>
      <p sl="en">These people are indeed a European challenge. They will probably need shelter. We have certain funds. We have certain agencies. We have certain policies to try to assist these people. As I said, we are considering the possibility of using the temporary protection mechanism. This can be activated when there is a mass influx of people who are unable to return. But for this to be activated, it needs a qualified majority in the Council. Today, that majority does not exist. We are, of course, monitoring this very closely and we will bring it back to the Council next week. But before we activate this mechanism, I am calling – and I will continue to call – on Member States to put solidarity into action: not only to come out with beautiful words, but to act.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to find solutions to assist Italy and Malta and possibly other countries who will be under pressure. I urge Member States to do this. There are solidarity funds available for European countries who respond to this appeal. This will all be discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council next week. I will be happy to report back to you after that.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the report, I would like to respond to Mr Meyer and Mr Tavares. I really respect the opinions of everyone, but it seems to me that their views on Lampedusa and what is happening in Lampedusa are hardly generous.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wanted to inform them that 12 000 people arrived in Lampedusa within the space of three nights. Lampedusa is a small island with 6 000 inhabitants and 12 000 people arrived suddenly in three nights, increasing the population to 20 000. I think it is very difficult for any country to accept such a large number of people arriving in such a short space of time on a small island which has no facilities for such a great number of arrivals. There are currently 1 400 migrants on Lampedusa. Much has been done, and as soon as sea conditions permitted, the migrants were transferred to other centres, primarily in the south of the country.</p>
      <p sl="it">This brings us to the report. I wanted to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political parties who, with their different sensibilities, have contributed very effectively to this report. They made a fundamental contribution, in absolute transparency, in the same spirit that inspired us all at the beginning. I also thank Commissioner Malmström for the enthusiasm she has shown for the concept of burden sharing, which should influence her work within the Commission and thus within Council. If she continues to show the same enthusiasm, I think the results will follow.</p>
      <p sl="it">I end by saying that the situation is very difficult to sum up. Insofar as a summing up is possible, I would like to say that any policy will be ineffective and incomplete as long as huge differences persist between the levels of development in the North and South of the world, as long as huge differences persist in the quality of democratic institutions, and as long as there are vast differences in respect for human rights. We must take action as part of a major policy of strategic cooperation and aid that will have an impact on the structural causes that led to these huge inequalities between North and South. If we solve those structural causes, the rest will follow and the world we all live in will probably be a better place.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am highly critical of the action that the EU is taking with regard to migration. The different interests of Germany, France, Spain and the other Member States, divided between Northern and Southern Europe, are placing Italy in a very awkward situation. The Italian Government would do well to procrastinate less and act more, rejecting migrants until Europe comes up with a genuine common immigration policy. The European Union needs a common asylum policy and to ensure that the principles of solidarity and burden sharing do not remain mere promises on paper. This would be the situation if Italy were to take on the burden of a situation that is changing the face of North Africa and the entire Mediterranean region. Italy can no longer accept Libyans, Tunisians and Egyptians until France, Germany and Austria cease rejecting anyone who comes from North Africa through their territory. Until Brussels coordinates the management of migration flows with the governments in Paris, Berlin and Vienna, as well as Rome and the other Member States, Italy would do well to adopt a much more uncompromising stance than it is doing at present.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report on migration has a solution for preventing migration flows. The rapporteur believes that we should prevent migration by investing in the countries that are the source of migration flows. In a time of economic and financial crisis, however, it is not possible for the EU to ‘finance’ the third world on a massive scale, at the expense of maintaining the living standards of European citizens. There have been, there are and there will continue to be enormous economic differences between the EU and Africa. If these differences were erased, and third world citizens no longer had any reason to migrate to the EU, it would be because we had contributed to a decline in standards in EU countries. We must not delude ourselves that migration results only from violations of fundamental human rights. A large percentage of migrants come to the EU only for a ‘better’ life. Sociological research shows that the greater the percentage of migrants in the EU, the more dissatisfied local people are with their way of life. If the number of migrants exceeds a certain percentage, they lose interest in becoming part of European society and, on the contrary, create their own society within the EU. The EU should focus migration policy exclusively on violations of human rights. The financial and economic differences between migrant countries and the EU should not be a reason for providing funding to these countries. The policy on preventing migration must be combined with a policy on the prevention of migration at the EU’s external borders.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For weeks now, thousands of migrants have been landing on the shores of the Mediterranean and, in particular, in Malta and Lampedusa, fleeing the situation in their country, where unprecedented political instability reigns. Frontex has rightly launched Operation Hermes to help the Italian authorities cope with this mass influx of migrants to their shores. The management of this humanitarian crisis must not be left to the Italian authorities alone. The control of the EU’s external borders must be a joint effort, because it is a joint challenge. This mass influx of third-country nationals will result in waves of illegal migrants entering many Member States. We need only see how the French authorities are intercepting every day hundreds of illegal migrants arriving straight from Italy. We know full well that those asylum seekers include many economic migrants who ‘slip’ into these mixed migratory flows. Moreover, the European effort must be stepped up. The Member States must provide Frontex with the resources it needs to carry out its missions. We also need to cooperate more with the Tunisian authorities.

      <p sl="en">The situation in Libya at present is very uncertain. What is certain, however, is that it has brought about a humanitarian crisis. As this report describes, armed conflicts, especially when they involve human rights abuses, give rise to huge increases in migratory flows to neighbouring countries. In view of the massive proportions these could lead to, the EU’s Frontex programme cannot be the best tool to deal with such levels of migration. The EU must, as of now, set up and plan a proper response, including a detailed burden-sharing action plan to help refugees resettle in a coordinated manner. This should be based on the solidarity clause contained in Article 80 of the TFEU. One could quibble about what particular number of refugees could be defined as an ‘emergency’. However, we need to have a detailed plan laid out, with clear thresholds on a country-by-country basis, so that EU governments and the Commission are both ready and well prepared to deal with an imminent crisis. As a Maltese MEP, it is very disappointing that the Commission is apparently so under-prepared to deal with a crisis that has long been inevitable.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The motion for a resolution highlights a very significant and important matter. It not only focuses on the problem of equal treatment for women and men in rural areas, but also points directly to the need to create equal opportunities for women living in rural areas, similar to those enjoyed on a daily basis by women living in urban centres. I think that we have paid too little attention in Parliament thus far to the social and professional development of women in rural areas. Women living in rural areas come up against many obstacles every day, both economic and infrastructure-related, which, to a significant extent, limit their opportunities in terms of access to education, health protection and, most importantly, the labour market. After all, not many job offers are targeted at rural areas, mainly due to the fact that these areas are significantly less developed in economic terms. That is why it is so important to support rural development policies by improving access to advanced infrastructure, or by means of opportunities to benefit from highly developed information and communications technologies. I am sure that the Members of the European Parliament can also do a great deal to ensure that rural areas catch up with the benefits of civilisation. We are, after all, able to organise various kinds of training or workshops, during which we can provide real help in accessing EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, democracy, freedom, solidarity and Christian ideals are the common European values that I believe in. These were also avowed by Count János Eszterházy, a Slovakian Hungarian politician, who was condemned on trumped up charges by the Communists in 1947 and died a martyr’s death in Mírov prison in 1957. Apart from his countless other merits, he was the only politician who, as a Member of Parliament, condemned and voted against the deportation of the Jews in the Parliament of the fascist Slovakian state in 1942. His only crime was to stand up without fail for the Hungarians of Slovakia who, together with the German-speaking citizens, were vilified en masse , and made stateless and displaced under the shameful Beneš decrees. The EU should be ashamed that these inhumane decrees legitimising state terror are still in force, and the rehabilitation of János Eszterházy, as well as hundreds of thousands of citizens deprived of their human dignity, is still awaited. I call on my honourable fellow Members to have deeper concern about protecting our common European values.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, this year, the separatist demonstrations organised by the Hungarian extremists in Transylvania to celebrate Hungary’s national day were marked by a worrying display of radicalism, especially due to the support and declarations from senior representatives of the Hungarian State and one of the European Parliament’s vice-presidents.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Hungarian celebration on 15 March jeopardises from one year to the next the good understanding between Romanians and Hungarians. In this situation, provocative gestures, such as the recent action by a Hungarian extremist who symbolically hanged the hero of the Transylvanian Romanians’ struggle in 1848 for their national rights, only serve to threaten peaceful coexistence.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I strongly condemn these displays of extremism. I call on the Romanian authorities to swap political complicity for legal measures. I also appeal to the European forums to take action to halt the escalation of ethnic hatred and territorial separatism in a region where the wounds of the past have a unique opportunity to be closed with the help of European values.</p>

You are right: it is not possible. Yet in Latvia, where more than 40% of the population is Russian-speaking, it is possible. Today, in the Latvian Parliament, nationalist and Nazi members wish to hold a referendum on the closure of Russian schools in Latvia. At the same time, OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, Knut Vollebaek, arrives in Latvia and announces that he can be proud of integration in Latvia Do you think that I am joking? You are mistaken. What, moreover, do you think will happen if Russian schools are closed in Latvia? I shall tell you – a civil war will break out in Latvia. If the European Parliament does not react today to this overt radical initiative, by tomorrow, it will already be too late. Thank you.</p>

The first thing is for the announced safety tests to be carried out quickly and transparently, and for States to be required to close obsolete or unsafe plants. The first tests should be carried out at first-generation plants, which use the same technology as Fukushima. They are at the end of their useful lives and are technically obsolete.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission’s Secretary-General, Catherine Day, recently described the Irish bank bailout as ‘tough but sustainable’. This is not a bailout but a sell-out: a sell-out, at EU insistence, to bondholders – senior, junior, secured, unsecured – every type, category and class of bondholder, while Irish taxpayers shoulder intolerable debt.</p>
      <p sl="en">The cost of the bank bailout is EUR 70 billion, not to mention the EUR 200 billion in emergency funding from the ECB. How is a small island of 4.4 million people supposed to cope with this madness? The debt burden for every man, woman and child in Ireland is roughly EUR 160 000 just to bail out the banks, and that is not including the interest. A little comparison: if France – population 62 million – were faced with an equivalent banking crisis, the debt of French citizens would be EUR 1 trillion. Would the Commission describe that as ‘tough but sustainable’?</p>

Instead, it is with deep regret that I inform this House of the callous and brutal murder of a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Twenty-five-year-old Constable Ronan Kerr died at the hands of Republican terrorists on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Constable Kerr, a Catholic police officer, was murdered when a booby-trap bomb planted under his car exploded on Saturday as he left for work. He died at the scene. I call on this House to condemn this atrocity and to call for an end to such violent acts at the hands of Irish Republican terrorists intent on dragging Northern Ireland back to its darker days and derailing the political process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 2007, dissident Republican terrorists have planted dozens of booby-trap bombs under the private cars of police officers. Thankfully, most of these have failed to detonate. I am sure that you will also join with me in calling for all information regarding this murder to be given to the police. There are people in the local community who have information about Constable Kerr’s brutal murder. They need to come forward and bring these murderers to justice, not shield them from it. They need to do it for the future of our country and out of respect for a brave police officer and his grieving mother and family.

The clear provision for the facility for a Member State to restructure debt post-2013 is a straightforward departure from the European Union’s original position when the crisis broke, that debt restructuring would be precluded at all costs.

Recommendation 1521/2001 of the Council of Europe urges saving this Csango minority culture, while outlining specific measures. Although there have been steps forward in the matter over the last decade as a result of the recommendation, the situation is far from satisfactory. The Council of Europe does not have at its disposal the European legislation or a mechanism of accountability that makes compliance with this possible and which ensures the effective functioning of the European Union. The Council of Europe is ahead of the EU in many issues concerning the provision of human rights at a high level, but its recommendation and its treaties cannot achieve the desired effect.

      <p sl="de">It remains a key task of European rural policy to achieve equivalent living conditions in all regions, preventing the one-sided development of heavily populated urban areas, so that, even in rural areas, people can look forward to staying put and making a successful life. The focus of the common agricultural policy (CAP) over recent decades has been on the positive economic development of agriculture and rural areas. In future, it will be geared increasingly to shaping and furthering future-oriented rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">This will require fresh efforts and new strategies by all concerned. It will be more necessary than ever to take account of the needs of women in rural areas and to utilise their potential. Experience shows that, in rural areas most particularly, quality of life and economic strength are linked to the presence of women and their involvement in a wide range of activities. It has become apparent in recent years that significant advances for rural societies generally result from support for women and women’s projects. Findings to that effect have been gleaned from experience with such support under the second pillar of the CAP and various other EU funding schemes in all regions of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, women also have an essential role to play in agriculture. This is a sector where women have made a substantial contribution in recent years to business diversification and adjustment to the market, thereby advancing the practical outworking of the sector’s multi-functionality. In addition to their own food production, agricultural businesses also offer innovative products and services. The types of economic potential represented here can be utilised to an even greater extent. In this context, there are opportunities to provide practical support measures for women in agriculture. Greater account must be taken of the wide range of vocational skills, interests and achievements of women. To that end, we call, in particular, for women to have a full share in the resources that underpin farming as a way of life and a type of business. Women farmers want a share in rights and duties that is commensurate with their co-responsibility for the farm business, including through the appropriate representation of interests on agricultural bodies. Ensuring adequate social cover for all women who work in agriculture is essential.</p>
      <p sl="de">Following an intensive dialogue, we succeeded, in our vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in adopting the report with only one vote against. No amendments have been tabled for tomorrow’s vote in plenary. That indicates to me that we have found a very good compromise that is acceptable to all groups. A unanimous vote would give the report the necessary weight for it – I hope – to receive sufficient consideration in the Commission and the Council. I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially the shadow rapporteurs, for their truly excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The important role of women in agriculture and rural areas must not be overlooked in the forthcoming debate on the future of the CAP post 2013. I am confident that our report will provide an important basis for this essential debate and that it will also make a positive contribution to the forthcoming financial debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I congratulate Elisabeth Jeggle for her good work in this report and for her continued work in this area over the number of years I have known her. It is a compliment to her work that there are no amendments tabled to this important report.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the short time I have, I want to draw attention to several paragraphs in it. I welcome paragraph 4 about the importance of an adequate budget for agriculture in general, and paragraph 10, about new technologies in rural areas and the need to widen the access to broadband. I think paragraph 34 is particularly important. Women ought to be adequately represented in all political, economic and social bodies in the agriculture sector so that decision-making processes are informed by both male and female perspectives. That is really important, and I regret to say that the face of farm organisations is unfortunately all too male. We do need to look at that issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, the Commission needs to be aware that the problem for male and female farmers at the moment is the uncertainty over the debate on CAP reform. I worry that some farmers are trying to second guess the outcome of those reforms and that they may be taking on additional costs, which will be a burden to them. I would ask you to bring that message to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the main concern of women in rural areas is the lack of jobs. The lack of jobs means low incomes for the elderly, which, in turn, increases the risk of poverty. In addition, children’s education and healthcare services in rural areas are the lifeblood of these communities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The precarious nature of the basic infrastructure in the countryside means that entrepreneurs show less interest in developing farms and production units in these areas. I urge Member States to use the Structural Funds to remedy the lack of basic infrastructure in rural areas and to implement policies for improving access to the public infrastructure for everyone. I call on the Commission and Member States to abide by their commitment to improve the broadband infrastructure in rural areas as a means of boosting their competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Rural tourism based on family tourist enterprises creates jobs, makes it possible to combine family obligations with work, and encourages the rural population to remain in the countryside.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome this timely report from Elisabeth Jeggle and thank her for her good cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not many people realise that 42% of those engaged regularly in agriculture are women, and that three out of every ten holdings in the EU are managed by women. In order for women and families to remain in the countryside and make their contribution to achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy through agriculture, there must be a range of services and facilities for normal everyday life. These services should include such things as healthcare and care services, education, leisure, transport and broadband.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is crucial that all services are not just market-oriented. There also needs to be proper social insurance for women working in agriculture so that their future and their pensions can be guaranteed. It is also important for women’s entrepreneurial skills to be facilitated and, across the board, for women to be involved in decision making at local and regional level, in farm organisations and, indeed, in all decision-making bodies. That will have a huge impact and will help ensure women’s future role in agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the situation of women in agriculture and the rural sphere reflects and is being damaged by the deep crisis into which current policies, such as the common agricultural policy (CAP) and others, have plunged rural areas. Women represent 42% of agricultural workers in all countries of the European Union. The great majority of these women work on family farms. They are thus particularly affected by the closure of hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized farms and by the process of destruction of family farming that has resulted from successive CAP reforms. They are also, as in other areas of activity, hit particularly hard by unemployment, insecure jobs, low wages and poverty. All of this is exacerbated by the antisocial policies imposed under the pretext of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fine words and declarations of good intentions are therefore not enough. A break with these policies is required, ascribing value to the roles of women, to their rights and to equality, and ascribing value to and strengthening, among other things, the network of services relating to rural resources, health, education and family assistance. It is also necessary to make cultural and leisure activities available, and to combat the various asymmetries and desertification.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I personally believe that the most important sections in the report are those about living conditions in the countryside, and I would like to make a few remarks on this point.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Firstly, there is the important role played by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development in modernising villages. This fund must be financed adequately and as part of the future common agricultural policy to help narrow the disparities between rural and urban areas. Secondly, I believe that we need to start, especially in the new Member States, with modernising the basic physical infrastructure. This must remain, without fail, a component of the EAFRD.</p>
      <p sl="ro">My last comment concerns the ageing of the rural population. I would like to emphasise in connection with this point the importance of the programmes aimed, on the one hand, at the early retirement of farmers and farm workers and, on the other, at setting up young farmers in business.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle for the approach she has adopted in this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I feel that it is vital to recognise the significant role played by women in agriculture, both in primary production and in the diversification of economic activities on farms and in rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that we need to draw attention to the high level of poverty and isolation which affects women in the countryside, thereby emphasising the need for effective measures to guarantee equal opportunities for women in agriculture as a main objective of the common agricultural policy. In this context, it is essential to improve the quality of life of women living in rural areas by providing them with the easiest possible access to education and vocational training, lifelong learning, effective local public healthcare services, not to mention to the infrastructure and services for supporting children and families.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should emphasise that improving equal opportunities for women in rural areas involves promoting their role more actively, both in farming and in other areas of economic activity, including in protecting agriculture’s multi-functionality.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it was important to put this topic on the table.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is very conscious of the essential role women play in agriculture and in rural areas. It can see that this is a task for the rural development policy. The rural development regulation provides for support in a number of areas which are important for women in rural areas. The setting up and development of micro-enterprises, adding value to agricultural projects and seeking sales outlets for them are only a few examples.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rural development policy also foresees possibilities to help men and women to balance family and professional life. For example, under the basic services measure, social facilities like day care centres for children or elderly people can be supported. In addition, local transport services and small-scale infrastructure are eligible for support.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in rural areas is very diverse across Member States, including as regards possibilities and requirements for women. Member States and regions have to carefully analyse the situation and design tailor-made measures linked to local conditions, taking account of the specific problems women face. For example, Member States can give preference to women with regard to certain measures. In addition, Member States can use financial engineering to set up guarantee funds in order to help women to get access to credit. Women should also play an important role in the LEADER Programme, where they should bring in their specific interests and their specific potential in order to mobilise the development potential of an area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission agrees that it would be useful to have more data on the situation of women. However, especially in the light of Member States’ call for simplification, it would prove difficult to convince them of additional reporting burdens. But for those data for which it is possible, statistics should be presented and analysed, broken down by gender. The Commission will include, where available, data on women in its progress report on the implementation of the strategic guidelines for rural development.</p>
      <p sl="en">One very important factor in taking women forward in agriculture and rural areas is the exchange of experience. In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the European Network for Rural Development and its constituent national networks. They can be used to learn from each other’s best practices and it would be desirable if more women’s associations made use of these existing networks in order to connect women in different rural areas with each other.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I come from Romania where a high proportion of the population live in the countryside. This is precisely why I am aware that it is absolutely imperative for us to focus greater attention on the status of women in these areas, taking into account the specific opportunities and challenges.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education and of the Committee on Regional Development, I want to stress the need to provide a vocational training system which will offer women adequate training both as producers and entrepreneurs, especially so that we can therefore meet the Europe 2020 strategy targets. This can also be achieved by providing farmers with better access to broadband Internet services.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Supporting entrepreneurial initiative among women can provide them with incomes supporting a stable way of life, thereby giving them economic independence. This will allow us to eliminate the impact of social exclusion and poverty, which have a disproportionate effect on women.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this very same context, we are also talking about the future reform of the common agricultural policy, as part of which we will need to give greater consideration to the role and needs of women in rural areas. Making living in the countryside and farming more attractive remains a challenge, but it can offer women in these areas real opportunities for economic and personal development.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is men who most frequently choose careers in the agricultural sector, but women have been present in rural areas since time immemorial and, unfortunately, their contribution has always been underestimated. Their consistent actions and long-term approach to many issues help improve the quality of life and work in rural areas. They are, however, very frequently not represented during the resource planning stage, and taking female farmers’ needs into account in this respect could bring many benefits to rural communities. We should ensure that professional development opportunities are open to women in agriculture by providing real support in the form of education or also careers advice. It is important to promote rural areas to women as an attractive place to work, where it is possible to realise both family and professional plans.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the accession treaties of the three Member States, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Lithuania, included the request to decommission a number of nuclear reactors which no longer met the safety conditions and could not be upgraded in a cost-effective manner. The aim of the financial assistance provided by the European Union was not to cover the entire decommissioning cost. The assistance was intended for measures in the areas of decommissioning, maintaining and monitoring reactors after shutdown, waste treatment, waste and spent fuel storage and decontamination, and dismantling work, as well as in the energy sector (for the replacement of the production capacity of the decommissioned units, improving energy supply security and energy efficiency, and other measures contributing to the necessary restructuring and upgrading of the energy infrastructure) and dealing with the social consequences (providing support for plant staff in maintaining a high level of safety after closure and retraining staff for new decommissioning tasks).</p>
      <p sl="ro">Due to the fact that financial assistance was decided without any ceiling being specified, which even continued after decommissioning plans and strategies were drawn up, new, additional financial support could be provided. The European Union has provided significant sums of money in funding this activity, amounting to roughly EUR 2.8 billion between 1999 and now.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report calls for the following aspects to be clarified in the future evaluations carried out by the European Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European Union: whether the funds allocated by the European Union were used to ensure safe decommissioning; whether decommissioning guarantees the safe storage of nuclear waste; whether there was sufficient coordination between the three existing programmes so that the experience accumulated was used effectively and the model was followed, based on projects prepared and funded previously in order to achieve a reduction in costs; whether the current plans and strategies are complete or whether it is still possible to add new activities and provide additional funds later on; whether additional sums still need to be allocated to energy projects or whether attention needs to be focused on decommissioning projects; and whether financing for these activities still needs to be provided from EU funds.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the early decommissioning of nuclear reactors in the three EU candidate countries of Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria prevented the creation of appropriate national funds to cover all the costs connected with decommissioning the plants, and Community assistance was therefore essential for coping with the substantial financial and economic burden.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Expert studies show, however, that the costs for taking the plants out of operation have already exceeded the level of planned assistance from the EU, and have probably exceeded the original estimates as well, although the actual decommissioning is still in the initial phase. The decommissioning will therefore have to carry on, ladies and gentlemen, even after the end of the financial perspective covering the period up to 2013, and I therefore consider it necessary to consider releasing further funds for the projects to decommission these three nuclear plants.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Union has 143 nuclear power plant units and, according to the data published by the Energy DG in March for 2010, nuclear energy accounts for roughly 28% of the European Union’s energy mix.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The events in Japan have sounded an alarm bell regarding the risks associated with nuclear power plants. Shutting down nuclear power plant units early and decommissioning them is a major financial and economic burden. This is why the European Union can provide financial assistance to the Member States affected, by which I mean Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. The lack of funding for decommissioning measures will delay this process, which would pose a threat to the environment and human health.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We urge the relevant national bodies to finalise their detailed decommissioning plans, as well as the Commission to report on this process, clearly describe the scope of the EU funding in these cases and provide a detailed long-term financial plan for the decommissioning projects.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member and thank her for her cooperation in preparing this important report. When they joined the European Union, three Member States made commitments that were complex both economically and socially: to close their nuclear power plants for the first time, without having the required financial capacity or experience. The European Union really did show solidarity by committing itself to providing the required financial assistance, not just to fund decommissioning, but also to contribute to the development of alternative energy projects and towards mitigating the negative social impact of decommissioning. I agree that some issues still need to be addressed, such as the allocation of money to carry out specific decommissioning work, and Member States’ complex administrative structures, which are perhaps preventing the allocated funding from being absorbed effectively. I believe that the European Commission should play a greater coordinating role in order to ensure the timely and safe closure of these nuclear reactors, to guarantee transparency as regards the use of funds, and to encourage these countries to develop alternative energy and create new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, nearly half of European Union Member States have nuclear plants within their territory. Many of the reactors in operation are relatively old, which creates an acute need for some of these reactors to be dismantled for reasons of safety, and of defending and safeguarding public health and the environment. In the case of new Member States confronted with the requirement to decommission a number of plants, it seems only right to us that they be able to expect EU support to adequately and safely complete their decommissioning processes. These processes should include the necessary maintenance and supervision following closure; the processing, storage and decontamination of waste; the environmental upgrading of installations; and support in replacing the energy capacity of decommissioned plants, paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the report rightly states, the social consequences of this process should be taken fully into account, guaranteeing the safeguarding of workers’ jobs, together with all safety conditions before, during and after decommissioning.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the Marinescu report talks about the effectiveness and efficiency of EU funding spent on decommissioning Soviet-style nuclear reactors. The Slovak Republic completely rebuilt its nuclear plant at Jaslovské Bohunice after the accident at Chernobyl, fitting the most up-to-date safety equipment from specialised French and German firms.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Following completion of the extensive modernisation, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear plant was ready for more than 30 years of safe operation. Nevertheless, for the peace and assurance of the citizens of neighbouring Austria, the Slovak Republic agreed during EU accession talks to the early decommissioning of the V1 and V2 reactors at Jaslovské Bohunice, which were fitted out to the highest standards.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I see the symbolic contribution of the EU to the costs of taking these reactors out of production only as an attempt to compensate at least partly for the loss suffered by the Slovak Republic, which has been deprived of a powerful and efficient source of clean power, and not as a real contribution towards the removal of this plant.</p>

    <intervention id="1-265-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission very much welcomes Parliament’s own-initiative report on the efficient and effective EU funding of decommissioning of nuclear power plants in the new Member States. Nuclear safety is, and will remain, an absolute priority for the EU, and this is why the Commission attaches great importance to efforts that facilitate the safe decommissioning of nuclear reactor units that have been deemed not to be upgradeable to the necessary safety standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first say that we share with Parliament many of the views expressed in its report. We agree with the need for Member States to provide detailed decommissioning plans, as well as sound long-term financial planning. We also deem it essential for the funds, for the most part, to be allocated to decommissioning activities and for the Commission to have an important role to play in ensuring strict monitoring of the use of the funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes in a strict application of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, so we share the opinion of Parliament that it is up to the operators of the nuclear plant to ensure that financial resources for decommissioning are already allocated during the operational life of the plants. Decommissioning must be made as safe as possible, and sound, transparent and supervised management of decommissioning funds is crucial for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">It can also be noted, however, that the report focuses on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning. The Commission was glad to see, in various parts of the report, that there is full recognition that the main objective of the EU funding was, first and foremost, to ensure that the reactor units were closed and remained so for nuclear safety reasons. We believe that having met this objective is an essential element to be taken into account when assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers it important to clarify that EU support was never intended to cover the full cost of decommissioning, nor to compensate for all the economic consequences. EU support was aimed merely at contributing to compensation for the early stages of closure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also underlines that it is the Member State that bears full responsibility for the decommissioning of its nuclear installations. Providing detailed long-term planning is the responsibility of the Member States, which are equally responsible for establishing precise timetables and cost estimates for the completion of decommissioning.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for this timely debate on an issue which, in the context of Fukushima, has become more pertinent. Safe and complete decommissioning is a key element of nuclear safety, for which we aim at the highest standards. Parliament’s report constitutes a valuable contribution to the discussion that the Commission will have with the three Member States concerned in view of assessing possible financial EU support beyond 2013.</p>

      <p sl="el">The nuclear threat, as one of the consequences of the terrible earthquake in Japan and the tsunami that followed, makes the debate of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control extremely topical.

The aim of these efforts is to ensure that nuclear power plants function properly and safely, so that we never see another Chernobyl or Fukushima and, at the same time, to address the impact of closure and decommissioning by meeting the energy requirements of the countries in which they operate. These efforts, which are accompanied by considerable financial support in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria, illustrate just how seriously the EU takes the question of nuclear safety. This is a carefully designed programme which started in 1999. The aim of this financial support is also to help improve the environment and modernise energy production, transmission and distribution, and to strengthen the security of energy supply. Evaluating the return on the resources made available and respect for their sound and transparent management are the factors that will guarantee that the objective is attained.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The natural disaster in Japan and the nuclear disaster that followed in its wake have drawn attention to the importance of the topic. The effects of the disaster, as with Chernobyl, could last for decades and be a sad, unwanted legacy for generations to come. This case has also demonstrated that energy wastage must be reduced and the emphasis gradually placed on renewable energy. Today’s report criticises on several points the financing of nuclear power plant closures in new Member States as regards transparency and implementation. In addition to the closure of the power plants specified in the report, I believe that it is extremely important to inspect all European nuclear power plants and, if need be, make them safer in order to prevent a similar disaster in the future. For this reason as well, I ask my fellow Members to discuss the motion for a resolution recently submitted by myself and my Austrian fellow Member in the interest of nuclear energy safety in the Danube region, as part of and within the scope of joint European cooperation.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-270-000" speaker_id="28137" name="Kader ARIF" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="France" birth_date="03-07-1959" birth_place="Alger" p_group="Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All the contributions have helped in the drafting of this report and, thanks to the cooperation of all the political groups, and I am especially grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, we have on the table today a consistent text that sends out a powerful message.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, we are at a turning point in European investment policy and at a time when we have to seize the new power conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to meet a dual challenge. Firstly, that of providing European businesses with the tools they need for high quality foreign investment that is protected by a legal framework providing long-term support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, Europe must strengthen its position as the world’s leading beneficiary of foreign direct investment and give itself the means to control that investment so as to encourage sustainable development that creates high quality employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By voting on this report, the first official expression of our institution since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, Parliament is fully assuming its role as a new colegislator in trade regulatory matters and is voicing its priorities at a time when the first investment protection negotiations are about to begin. This expression is essential, because it is intended to relay the concerns of the citizens, who are showing a growing interest in trade matters and whom we must support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a world, today, where conflicts also take place in a trade context, protecting those businesses of ours that invest abroad must become a priority. International agreements have been created to protect investors from harsh, unjustified expropriations and hidden laws aimed simply at eliminating them from this or that market. This primary objective must be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although Europe is one of the most open markets in the world, a balance must be restored with our main partners so that European businesses can benefit from a level playing field. This is the proposal made in this report, which stresses the need for future agreements to include standards relating to non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and protection against direct and indirect expropriation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, those standards must be defined in such a way as to prevent any misinterpretation. Some businesses have, in fact, used the vague wording in first-generation investment agreements to protect their interests beyond what is legitimate, for example, by attacking new social and environmental laws that harm their interests. Appearing before international arbitrators and with no transparency or possibility of appeal, they have demanded considerable compensation by claiming that those laws are on a par with indirect expropriation. Europe, which, in the future, will receive ever more investment, particularly from emerging countries, must guard against such abuses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the idea behind the reforms undertaken by the United States and Canada, two countries whose governments and authorities have suffered several setbacks in international arbitration cases and which have radically overhauled their investment agreement model.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By proposing new definitions of protection standards, the report strikes a fair balance between the protection of investors’ rights and the right of public authorities to regulate. This also means including in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the possibility for public authorities to legislate and regulate in the areas of national security, the environment, public health, workers’ and consumers’ rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, increased protection for investors must be accompanied by more responsible behaviour, particularly in developing countries, where the social and environmental laws are less binding. That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union. Furthermore, we must go beyond naming and shaming and include in all future agreements a set of clear corporate social responsibility rules with which businesses must comply and which are based on guidelines set by the OECD.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If our aim here really is to shape the contours of a new European investment policy, then I call in this report for it to be exemplary and to promote investment which is sustainable, respects the environment and encourages good quality working conditions in Europe and in third countries alike. That is why this report, by the power vested in it by Wednesday’s vote, must serve as a reference for all future negotiations conducted by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, according to Articles 206 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, foreign direct investment is an exclusive competence of the EU. The Commission has already compiled a list of countries which will be privileged partners for the negotiation of the first investment agreements: Canada, China, India, Mercosur, Russia and Singapore.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call on the Commission, Parliament and Member States to devise an integrated and coherent investment policy which will promote high quality investments and make a positive contribution to economic progress and sustainable development worldwide. We call for the European Union’s future policy to promote sustainable investments which respect the environment and encourage suitable working conditions in the businesses targeted by investment. We urge the Commission to ensure reciprocity when negotiating market access with its main trade partners from the developed countries and the major emerging economies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Madam President, as rapporteur for air transport agreements between the European Union and third countries, such as Canada and Brazil, I would like to ask the rapporteur and the Commissioner how the link will be ensured between gradual access to the market and airlines and these international investment agreements.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in the report on future European international investment policy, the rapporteur has drawn attention to many open questions regarding potential EU agreements. The first job of the EU is to protect the public interest of EU citizens, whom it represents in the areas entrusted to it by the Member States. However, the state-protected public interest often collides with the interests of aggressive foreign investors, who are frequently more skilful in international arbitration than the countries defending the interests of their citizens. The examples mentioned in the report of Argentina, the US and Canada provide concrete proof of this.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There is, therefore, a real need to define the principles of protection precisely in order to prevent them from being interpreted incorrectly by various investors. However, this important and as yet unresolved question continues to be the international responsibility of the EU, particularly from a financial perspective, as it is not clear who would bear the financial burden of a judicial dispute lost by the EU. The Council of the European Union has not yet given a proper answer to this question.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s report on the future European international investment policy. It is an important step that paves the way for the implementation of the new EU exclusive competence on investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, investment is a new frontier for the common commercial policy. We should seize the opportunity – we are in absolute agreement with Parliament on this – to build together an integrated and coherent investment policy that promotes investments and makes a positive contribution both to economic growth and sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also fully shares Parliament’s statement that investor protection should remain the first priority of the European investment policy. We believe that the new policy should serve the purpose of assuring all European investors that they are able to operate in an open and properly and fairly regulated business environment, not only within the internal market, but also when operating in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also take note of Parliament’s recommendation that the EU should draw on Member States’ best practices found in their bilateral investment treaties. Indeed, the thrust of the Union’s action in this area should be to deliver better results than those obtained by Member States individually.</p>
      <p sl="en">While aiming at high levels of protection for our investors, we should not compromise other objectives, such as the public capacity to regulate or coherence with other EU policies. The right of states and of the EU to take the measures necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives is a standing rule of the common commercial policy. It will equally apply to our investment policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The dispute settlement regime and the related financial responsibility are also very important issues and we need to further reflect on them. Our objective, as mentioned in the communication, is to ensure transparency, consistency of rulings and make the system as productive as possible. We also need to address a number of issues which arise because of the EU’s status under international law. We will take into account Parliament’s views, as expressed in the report, when we analyse possible options and further ideas for a comprehensive approach to these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will carefully consider all recommendations put forward in Parliament’s report, while progressively developing and implementing our investment policy. The Commission has already tabled proposals for investment negotiating directives for Canada, India and Singapore. We want to seize opportunities for ongoing wider trade negotiations and to engage in comprehensive investment negotiations with those countries. Parliament’s opinion is therefore very timely, to guide the Commission and the Council when we define final respective negotiation directives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, I would like to assure you that, as the development of a comprehensive European investment policy is now a joint responsibility of all the institutions, the Commission will stand ready to cooperate with Parliament and the Council while respecting the division of competences among all the institutions involved.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The enlargement, by the Treaty of Lisbon, of the EU’s sphere of competence to include foreign direct investment means that a true European policy on this matter can finally be envisaged. At this stage of developing the policy, the priority is to provide as much certainty as possible both to investments and to investors. Therefore, the shift from a national competence to a European one should not, under any circumstances, disrupt the proper implementation of the 1 200 or so agreements in force between the Member States and third countries. Again, for the sake of legal certainty and predictability, the EU must now devise an effective, transparent dispute settlement mechanism that is accessible to all investors, including the smallest ones (SMEs for example). The mechanisms integrated into the most recent bilateral trade agreements are a good foundation, but they only concern disputes between a state and the EU. Provisions suitable for a potential dispute between the EU and a company must be established. Lastly, the EU must seize this opportunity to go further: it must include in future agreements not only clauses facilitating the establishment of investors in these countries, but also basic provisions relating to social and environmental standards.</p>
