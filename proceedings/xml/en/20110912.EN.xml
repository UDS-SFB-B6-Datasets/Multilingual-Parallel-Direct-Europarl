      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome everyone back after the summer recess. I hope we have had a rest, although the break was different this time. During the recess, we followed the development of events in the Union and the world. They were important to us during the recess, too.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I was in constant touch with the Polish Presidency on measures related to the economic crisis. We discussed the situation as it developed and considered how we might react. As you know, a special sitting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was held on 29 August, and was attended by Commissioner Rehn, the President of the European Central Bank Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Euro Group Mr Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish Minister of Finance Mr Jan Vincent-Rostowski. In two days’ time, on Wednesday, we are going to discuss a report on the anti-crisis measures taken by the Commission, which will be presented by Mr Barroso, and at the end of September, at the next part-session, Parliament will have a visit from Mr Juncker.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Recent weeks have also brought us nearer to a successful end to the fighting in Libya. We can say with confidence that from the very beginning of these events the European Parliament supported the right side. Our unequivocal call for protection of the civilian population, which we made in a resolution adopted in March, was heeded. Now we must do everything possible for the European Union to be effective in helping the Libyan people rebuild their country, setting it on the road to democracy. I would also like to remind everyone that a debate on this subject has been scheduled for this part-session, when we will be able to discuss the matter more fully.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on a point of order, because you have mentioned everything that has happened concerning the euro crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want to put a question to you and also to ask what initiative we should take. Is it true that tomorrow we will see the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, here in Parliament? On what issue, I do not know and I shall not discuss the reasons for that, but my question is: is it true? And if it is true that you will see him, do you not think that it is necessary to ask that he also meet the competent committee about his austerity plan – that is the ECON Committee – as Mr Papandreou did? Mr Papandreou also came to Parliament about his austerity plan and then he came directly to the Crisis Committee to explain his plan. It was a very positive meeting.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not know why Mr Berlusconi is coming tomorrow, but if he is coming to see you concerning his austerity plan, my request to you is that he appear before the competent ECON Committee to explain his measures and the way Italy will apply the Stability Plan.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to express my group’s support for Mr Verhofstadt’s intervention. However I would like to ask whether the European institutions are doing themselves any favours by meeting with Mr Berlusconi on the day he should actually be appearing in court in Italy to answer charges in connection with the prostitution of minors.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">If we believe it important that the European institutions should be taken seriously in Italy – and this is now more important than ever – then we should not choose a procedure in relation to Mr Berlusconi that allows him once again to avoid appearing in court in Italy. Mr Busek and Mr Barroso, I would ask you to consider carefully whether Mr Berlusconi needs to meet with you on the very day that he is due to appear in court in Italy. These talks, including those with the committees mentioned, could surely be held on other days this week.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I acknowledge the proposal made by Mr Verhofstadt, which is perfectly reasonable in my view, and I am sure that if Parliament were to invite the Italian Prime Minister to any meeting that it might arrange, the Italian Government would make every effort to explain what action it is taking, as tomorrow’s visit by Prime Minister Berlusconi to the European institutions in fact shows.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am however surprised, I must admit, by the threatening tone adopted by Ms Harms: let us remember that, whether people like him or not, Silvio Berlusconi is the Prime Minister of a country located in Europe, and it is in Europe because of its history and its love of democracy! Let us remember, too, that it is not the job of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to decide who should meet the President of the European Parliament! It is not the job of the Group of the Greens to lecture people on democracy in this House!</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore ask Ms Harms to be more measured and to remember that, as part of his visit to the European institutions tomorrow, Prime Minister Berlusconi has every right to request a meeting with the President of the European Parliament also.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, is it true that Mr Berlusconi is due to turn up here tomorrow? I have just heard from Mr Mauro that he is planning to come here tomorrow so that he can be the first to congratulate Mr Schulz when he is nominated. Could this possibly be true?</p>
      <a text="(Laughter)"/>
      <p sl="de">I have another concern, Mr President. An open session of the Conference of Presidents is to be held here in the Chamber on Wednesday from 14.00 to 15.30. We are due to curtail our plenary session to listen to an unelected, international official. Until now it was always the case that the Chamber was reserved for Heads of State and Government, Presidents-in-Office of the Council, etc. I find it outrageous that we should cut short our plenary session because someone in this House suggested listening to what an unelected official has to say instead. I would urgently request that you convene the plenary session at 15.00 and that the entire morning be dedicated to the debate on the debt crisis.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">That will be a matter for the Conference of Presidents to decide. Thank you for drawing attention to this. As for the first matter which was raised, the information I have received indicates that Mr Berlusconi is not making an official visit to the European Parliament. I do not have any information about an official visit of Mr Berlusconi to the European Parliament. I can assure you of this in all seriousness.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to move on to the next piece of information. Tomorrow we will welcome the President of the Republic of Poland, Mr Bronisław Komorowski, to the European Parliament. Poland currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Mr Komorowski will give an address at a formal sitting at 12.00.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Thursday 15 September is the United Nations’ International Day of Democracy. To ensure that democracy is not endangered, it needs to be permanently protected, cared for and promoted around the world. This is one of the main objectives of the work of the European Parliament, the most democratic of the EU’s institutions.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I will read the following information in English. I strongly condemn the violence organised on 2 July against our colleague, Sajjad Karim MEP, in the United Kingdom. His private house was attacked by around 30 protestors from an extremist organisation. They entered his property carrying anti-Islamic placards, while shouting at him and filming his house. Mr Karim was at home with his wife and children when this happened.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We must at all times be very clear and always strongly condemn such incidents, especially when they are hate crimes. Such threats to the freedom of speech of individual Members of Parliament are unacceptable. Mr Karim has been given a mandate in a democratic election by British citizens. Any attack on him and on his family is an attack on democracy and against his electorate. All necessary steps should be taken in order to protect Mr Karim in exercising his duties and enable him to enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of expression without being threatened, and to do his political work as a democratically elected representative.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Having expressed my support for our colleague in a letter I wrote to Prime Minister Cameron, today I publicly reaffirm my full support for you, Mr Karim, and for all victims of discrimination. This Parliament stands beside you in defence of our common values.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I met our colleague Mr Karim personally a few weeks ago, before the holidays.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return to the previous point, namely Prime Minister Berlusconi’s visit to this institution, because, as we have learnt, it is already the subject of jibes and ridicule.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should just like to know, Mr President – in the light of your explanation that there has been no official request for a meeting and that there will be no official visit by the Italian Prime Minister to the European Parliament – whether you will be meeting him and what the status of that meeting would be, tomorrow, during a visit which, I can assure you, most members of the public in our country regard as something of a mockery, given that the Prime Minister was due to appear in court in Naples tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is only right that you should inform the House of the circumstances of this visit; that way, we can end this farce, because the current attempt to attack the Italian Government in Europe has nothing to do with the purpose of Mr Berlusconi’s visit tomorrow to the European institutions. Furthermore, I should like to point out that I do not understand why this issue has been raised, given that the courts have already said that they will confirm another date for that meeting with Prime Minister Berlusconi.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Allow me to explain the matter very clearly. In answer to the question asked a moment ago by Mr Rinaldi, I have not received a proposal or a request concerning an official visit of Mr Berlusconi to the European Parliament. It cannot be ruled out that since the Prime Minister is due to be in Parliament tomorrow, if he actually does come here tomorrow, a courtesy meeting of a few minutes may take place. I cannot rule this out, but I have not received any kind of request for an official meeting. I am saying this again very clearly.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would also like to say that tomorrow we are receiving the President of the Republic of Poland. I am busy tomorrow afternoon with receiving our guest, and as things stand, I am quite unable to add to the programme any kind of longer visit by the Prime Minister of Italy. That is the situation as it is at the moment. I would like to ask you all to end this discussion. I have told you everything I know about the matter. Please let us end this discussion. I think we can end the discussion here.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Thursday</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I have received a request from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the vote on the motions for resolutions on the situation in Libya to be brought forward from the second part-session in September to the current part-session. This means moving the vote from the next part-session to this one. As you know, the debate will be held on Wednesday.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we wish to put forward a very simple argument. It is, of course, important for us to have a debate on this matter, and we will do so on Wednesday afternoon. I also wish to mention on this point that it is important for us to debate this matter separately from the situation in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, we believe that we need not just to debate this matter but also have a vote on it. It is not right for us to postpone a vote which will demonstrate consensus in our Parliament. If anything, we believe that we need to vote urgently on this matter. It is a good idea for us to vote before Gaddafi is captured or flees, and no one can guarantee that this will not happen before the next session. In a nutshell, the vote is just as important as the debate.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is in favour of this request; many things have happened in the Mediterranean this year, and I think that the events in Libya over the last few weeks deserve our attention.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot postpone the vote until such time as Colonel Gaddafi is captured, if he is captured – because this could happen soon, or it could take a long time. It is clear that the Libyan situation is an ongoing crisis. Europe has not always spoken with one voice in recent months on Libya; at times it has even been weak, and I believe that, with a vote, with an official pronouncement from Parliament, we can make a decisive contribution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have discussed the question of a sensible approach in the Conference of Presidents. I believe we have made the right decision, namely that the debate should be held this week, but that the relevant resolution should build on the information gathered by our own delegation which is travelling to Libya. I do not believe it is useful always to formulate resolutions immediately before a delegation travels to the country in question. In my opinion we should stick to the proposal from the Conference of Presidents and reject the motion by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>

    <intervention id="1-039-000" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President" name="Jerzy BUZEK" nationality="Poland" birth_date="03-07-1940" birth_place="Śmiłowice" m_state="PL">
      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the statement by the President to mark the 10th anniversary of 11 September 2001.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ten years ago, the events of 11 September rocked the world. Ruthless terrorists took the lives of almost 3 000 innocent people: mothers, fathers, wives, husbands and children, who died in the burning towers of the World Trade Center, in the Pentagon building and in the aircraft taken over by the attackers. Many Americans were killed that day, but so too were Europeans. As we said at the time, we were all Americans. Those who died were just innocent people from over 70 countries of the world. Those who attacked us that day have not been victorious.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The democratic world did not allow itself to be intimidated. That day saw the beginning of a new era in the fight against the world terrorism which had come to our cities and our homes. First New York, and then Madrid, London and Bali became targets in the new war. The fight against terrorism continues. The number of foiled attacks is a sign that slowly, but effectively, we are winning that fight. However, we will achieve complete success when we are able to change the mentality of those who hold even their own lives in the same contempt as they do the lives of their victims. Not just Europeans, but the entire community of the free world has the right to live and to build its future in freedom from fear.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We must not allow terrorism to become the new totalitarianism of the 21st century. It is our duty, the duty of politicians, to ensure that future generations inherit a Europe and a world which is peaceful and safe. There is no place in the communities of a civilised world for people whose faith tells them to kill those who think differently from them. We also note that the movements for liberation in North Africa and the Middle East today are based on the same fundamental rights and liberties of which we speak here in Europe. In this respect there has been a huge change over the last 10 years, and this is a success we in Europe share with all those who in many countries of the world today are fighting for freedom under the same banners and holding the same values.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Today the European Parliament unites in its thoughts and memories with the American nation, remembering most especially today the hundreds of firefighters and police officers who died while bringing help to the victims of the attacks. We honour their memory.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like us to stand and observe a minute’s silence in memory of the victims of terrorism worldwide.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement on the ongoing Doha negotiations.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-042-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Karel De Gucht" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving us the opportunity to make a declaration on the state of play of the multilateral trade negotiations. Allow me first to briefly recall the present state of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the negotiations were revitalised in early 2011 following strong political guidance by the leaders of the G20. The objective was to reach outlines of a comprehensive package by the summer, and to finalise the agreement by the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in the spring it became clear that a full Doha outcome could not be reached in 2011 due to a political impasse in the negotiations on industrial tariffs. The cause for this is fundamentally divergent expectations regarding the reciprocity of commitments that developed and emerging countries should make in opening their markets: one side asked for almost full harmonisation of commitments, while others insisted on far-reaching special and differential treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s position has been somewhere between the two extremes, asking the emerging countries to make ambitious commitments, while recognising that a certain degree of flexibility is still justified. Although the EU compromise proposal got large support from the industries concerned, there was unfortunately not enough traction around the negotiating table to negotiate further on the basis of this – I believe – good proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">WTO members then tried to agree on a narrower set of results by year-end. The idea was that this interim package would address particularly the specific needs of the Least Developed Countries, complemented with other components, such as an agreement on Trade Facilitation.</p>
      <p sl="en">But progress proved very elusive, and at the Trade Negotiations Committee at the end of July, the WTO Director General had to conclude that the package was not taking shape. Mr Lamy then suggested that the membership shift its focus to preparing discussions at the December WTO Ministerial Conference regarding regular WTO work, as well as the negotiating agenda beyond 2011. Prospects for reaching concrete negotiating results in the short term look rather bleak.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Commission, this state of affairs is deeply disappointing. The EU has played a proactive and constructive role in the negotiations throughout 2011, including by developing a solid compromise proposal in the key area of tariffs on industrial goods, and by consistently calling for deliverables to Least Developed Countries without payment. But in the absence of political will and flexibility in WTO members’ positions, it has not been possible to reach tangible progress in the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has always been a staunch defender of multilateralism. All institutions see eye-to-eye on this. Therefore, the Commission welcomes the strong support that the motion for a resolution expresses for the WTO as the guarantor of a rules-based trade system and as a key instrument of global economic governance. The Commission fully shares this view, and considers that the EU has a strong interest in a process of multilateral trade liberalisation which advances and remains relevant.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will therefore participate in a proactive manner in the consultation process that the WTO Director General is leading regarding the next steps in the multilateral negotiating agenda. The Commission’s approach to these consultations will be guided by three basic principles: first, the WTO needs to have an ambitious negotiating agenda that contributes to the recovery and rebalancing of the global economy; second, WTO members must not throw out the baby with the bathwater, but build on what is already on the table; third, particular attention should be put on addressing the legitimate needs of the Least Developed Countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, Honourable Members of Parliament, I thank you for your attention, and look forward to hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your excellent cooperation in helping to draw up this resolution and I look forward to a positive and beneficial exchange of views in the final discussions. I am convinced that international trade needs a strong and powerful World Trade Organisation. The economic and financial crisis has shown that existing commercial law has protected most Member States from protectionist measures. This is a genuine success, even though some trends are evident in the opposite direction. The WTO, and with it the entire system of commercial law, is a major gain. It is essential that the previous approach of intensive global cooperation should continue and that further integrationist steps should be taken in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is with regret that I see the lack of progress and the fact that the Doha Development Agenda may fail. However, we must also understand the following: the countries involved in the negotiations are no longer the same ones who were at the table when the Doha round began 10 years ago. We have all changed in this time, which is why the discussions should be resumed on a sector-specific basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Personally I believe it is unrealistic to stick to an all-encompassing draft plan. However, we can make the best of the situation in which we now find ourselves, thus avoiding further damage. The European Union in particular needs a strong WTO. We need to strengthen it because we are going to need it more than ever in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the next World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Geneva, this December, will mark the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Doha Round. Unfortunately it will not mark its success. On the contrary, we are now clearly facing the fact that the window of opportunity, which last year was expected for this year for a comprehensive, equitable and balanced global trade agreement, is rapidly closing, as Mr Lamy stated on 26 July in an informal meeting of the WTO’s Trade Negotiations Committee, and I quote:</p>
      <p sl="pt">What we are seeing today is the paralysis in the negotiating function of the WTO (…) What we are facing is the inability of the WTO to adapt and adjust to emerging global trade priorities, those you cannot solve through bilateral deals’</p>
      <p sl="pt">End of quote.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What in fact is at issue in the Doha Round is the need for a broad, harmonious opening-up of international trade, and for this to be used to support development, especially in least developed countries. In this context, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament fully supports the resolution adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on International Trade, relating to the ongoing negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. However, we have decided to table some amendments that will underline precisely our commitment to the multilateral system and to the development objectives of the Doha Round.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The S&amp;D Group deeply regrets the fact that the Doha negotiations appear to have reached an insurmountable impasse. Nevertheless, that is why we must put pressure on the Commission of the European Union to continue to give priority to a rules-based, multilateral trading system, established through the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Even if the Doha Round fails, the Union must continue to strive for a global order in international trade that will realise the objectives of Doha by building on what has been achieved over 10 years, instead of just casting it overboard.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although the global economy has changed a lot over the last 10 years, we socialists believe that developing countries, especially the least developed countries, remain, more than ever before, the key issue at the negotiations. We therefore support the proposal of the Director General of the WTO for an early harvest planned for December this year at that ministerial meeting. However, after the ministerial meeting, we will continue to give our firm support to the conclusion of a general multilateral trade agreement.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that fails to inspire much of a reaction among people. The issue of the Doha negotiations is far removed from most citizens, the media, and even many governments, which are now busy dealing with far more pressing financial and economic priorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is not a debate that truly excites Brussels, nor even, it seems to me, Geneva, at least not from what I have seen this year, both in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly and in its steering committee, of which I am a member. There is an air of resignation about the fact that nothing is happening now, that nothing must happen, that nothing can happen, that the challenges facing a better-regulated and more generous global market are too complicated, and that the boundaries between the opposing blocs – between emerging countries that regard themselves today as powers and the former powers of old, which are now struggling, countries in constant transition, with an identity crisis – are themselves always shifting and vague.</p>
      <p sl="it">In other words, the ship that the World Trade Organisation – and, therefore, we too – are aboard does not know where it is heading, because, as Seneca wrote, ‘If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.’</p>
      <p sl="it">In the meantime, Commissioner, the poorest countries are losing out: they were encouraged to comply with international trade rules, and a good 32 out of 48 of them have joined the WTO, but what good has it done them so far? Theirs is a paradoxical situation: they account for less than 1% of international trade, but have 12% of the world’s population, people who are often forced to live without access to basic services. The forthcoming Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference has a duty to adopt at least – I repeat, at least – a package of measures to help them, and yet we have received no guarantees on that score – anything but. We call on you, Commissioner, to look into this matter.</p>
      <p sl="it">Although it would have no significant impact on international trade balances, the poorest countries would benefit greatly from measures such as the introduction of duty-free access quotas for their products, the simplification of rules of origin, the introduction of measures to correct market distortions in sectors such as the cotton sector, the provision of technical assistance to internationalise their economies and – an extremely important requirement for us members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – the extension of the TRIPS waiver beyond 2016 for pharmaceutical products and data protection.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as we understand, none of this has been agreed yet. I understand your disappointment, Commissioner – we are disappointed too. We support you and the Commission in your commendable efforts. If there is no prospect of meeting the needs of the poorest countries, then we can well imagine the situation regarding much more complex issues, such as the balance between emerging countries, the European Union and the United States.</p>
      <p sl="it">If I am not mistaken, Pascal Lamy today inaugurated work on the construction of the WTO’s new headquarters in Geneva: this is a first step, and I must say that the need for proactive and industrious efforts to revive the work programme, objectives and the identity of international trade itself has never been so great.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, earlier in this session we heard a moving statement about the tenth anniversary of the terrible attack on the World Trade Centre.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other anniversary is that of the start of the Doha Round of negotiations towards a trade agreement. I would say that this in fact has killed millions of people – the people in the greatest poverty – or shortened their lives. I think that if we look at the responsibility for that, we see that the WTO has not fulfilled its aspirations to meet the Millennium Development Goals. It has failed the less developed countries in its belief in free trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we have in this resolution today is recognition that the Doha Round is dead in the water. It needs to be concluded as swiftly as possible with a package for the less developed countries. We need to concentrate on multilateral agreements because every single bilateral or plurilateral agreement tends to put trade into smaller regional or subregional blocks, and this undermines the multilateral direction which this Parliament believes is the right way to go.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, I am very pleased to see that the resolution calls for a reform of the WTO, because it is simply no longer fit for purpose. It needs to be revised around the principles of democracy and – bearing in mind that the WTO has never taken a single vote on anything, as it is all done by consensus – it needs to have transparency and accountability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our Group believes that the wholesale enthusiasm for free trade has ultimately not delivered the promised benefits. We believe that we should be basing WTO reform around trade justice and sustainable development, which should be the watchwords as we develop a new trade body for the planet.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, the resolution that will be passed by the European Parliament gives you a clear mandate in this critical phase of the Doha negotiations: you must press for a positive interim result at multilateral level in Geneva that will contribute to a reduction in the poverty suffered in the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">Everyone gathered here today recognises the status quo, which is why we must have an eye to the future – as Mr Taylor has just said: do you remember the start of these talks? The Doha Round was instigated 10 years ago in the shadow of the attacks in New York and the intention was to contribute to an improvement in living conditions in developing countries by further developing the WTO, thus eliminating the basis for the propaganda of hatred. However, the Commission’s negotiators and those of its competitors are mainly concentrating on the opening up of the global markets for services and penetration into previously protected sectors of general public interest. Developing countries were able to come together within the WTO to prevent this opening up from being forced upon them.</p>
      <p sl="de">In turn, you responded by switching the emphasis to the conclusion of bilateral agreements that enabled you to pursue your chief interests more effectively. This approach has patently failed to help reduce poverty. It actually threatens the establishment of a system of fair trade rules with worldwide validity under the umbrella of the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, my group urgently calls on you to return to the primacy of multilateral agreement. The least you should do in Geneva is to obtain an agreement for the so-called least developed countries package, which would bring improvements for the world’s poorest. We would also call on you to withdraw the Commission’s threat to abandon the promise to abolish the EU’s export subsidies for agricultural produce should the Doha Round fail. In view of the present catastrophic famine in East Africa and the increasingly difficult situation of the farmers – not just in the developing countries, but there in particular – it is actually necessary to speed up the abolition of export subsidies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is a rather famous book called ‘Alice in Wonderland’. This book has a slightly less well-known sequel, ‘Alice through the Looking Glass’. In that book there is a passage where the Red Queen tells Alice ‘the rule is jam tomorrow and jam yesterday, but never jam today’. Alice objects that it must happen sometimes that there is ‘jam today’. To which the Red Queen says – and here I paraphrase – no, there is never jam today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well, that is rather like the EU Trade Commissioner and the successive Doha rounds. We never do get the jam today. There is at least one reason for this. Parliament’s own Library briefing states that the focus of the Doha Round was to be on development.</p>
      <p sl="en">For most developing countries, the critical aspect of the Doha Round is agriculture. Around three quarters of the population of most developing countries reside in rural areas and, in consequence, a majority depend on the agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union’s common agricultural policy, or CAP, is equivalent to about USD 80 billion a year, and this huge subsidy is a distorting factor in world food markets. It erodes the fair operation of the market in food, generates export dumping and damages the ability of farmers in the developing world to earn a living. I think that some colleagues who do not agree with me about everything will agree with this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must further point out that a disproportionate amount of the CAP goes on subsidising the growing of sugar beet. This crop, grown in the developed world, can never be fully competitive – without subsidy – with sugar cane. It is the continuance of the CAP in its present form which sabotages a proper result from the Doha Round.</p>
      <p sl="en">What, then, are the prospects for meaningful reform? The answer is that there are too many politicians here in the European Parliament who oppose the reform of the CAP. It is just not going to happen. No meaningful reform of the CAP means no meaningful outcome to the Doha Round.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission states that one of its priorities is cutting tariffs in order to create new trade flows, but what about non-tariff barriers to trade? Quotas are barriers to free trade. The Commission sets quotas on fishing, for example. However, when certain Member States ignore these quotas, they become barriers to trade for law-abiding communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Import licensing requirements can be barriers to trade. European companies seeking to import from outside the EU may have to comply with licensing requirements as well as pay tariffs set by the Commission. Some of those imports may be from a third country with which a nation has strong historic and cultural ties. I am sure that many developing nations would benefit from the chance to trade more freely with the United Kingdom without being hampered by EU red tape and tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The anti-dumping policies so beloved by the Commission can themselves be barriers to free trade where they are cynically used to protect inefficient domestic producers from foreign competitors at the expense of the general public. Anti-dumping laws can stifle consumer choice and violate the rights of producers to enter into contracts freely.</p>
      <p sl="en">Laws and regulations are necessary. However, I have just given you three examples of how EU legislation actually stifles free trade within our own borders. Should a political union that regularly has to bail out its own uncompetitive and bankrupt States really be advising the WTO how to stimulate trade in developing nations?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha negotiations have been running for 10 years now. The world was a completely different place 10 years ago. For example, how have the BRICS countries developed in the last decade? Conditions have changed radically since then. However, from my point of view, the objectives that the partners have identified are still the same: we urgently need to help the poorest of the poor and we must reinforce the multilateral trade system. This will only succeed if we also have a strong World Trade Organisation in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The importance of the WTO becomes apparent when you think what the world would be like if it did not exist. In response to all the criticism we have heard I would ask: what is the alternative? Today’s European Union has 500 million citizens. In a few years’ time we will constitute 5 or 6% of the world’s population. Who is going to look after the poorest of the poor if we do not succeed in making progress in the context of the WTO? What about emerging countries like China, India, Russia and Brazil? Who is going to persuade these countries to sit down at the table to work on a common system of rules and to adhere to these rules? That is why we urgently need a strong WTO.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I would have liked from the Commission is an answer on how things are to proceed – I would be very grateful, Commissioner, if you could elucidate that for us. How are we, the European Union, to respond to the fundamental changes in the world over the last 10 years? I get the impression that the answer we would get in most areas in the trade strategy you have put forward would be ‘business as usual’. That certainly makes sense in the short term. But when are we going to take the time to consider what our answers are to be to today’s changed world? What should a European Union trade strategy be like if it is to meet the needs of the world in 10 or 15 years’ time? I would be very grateful if we could hear a little bit about this today. However, we also need to take the time to consider the consequences of the likely failure of this WTO round. Perhaps Parliament and the Commission could set aside half a day or perhaps a whole day for a workshop dealing with this issue in the relevant committee.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the commendable initiative of promoting development as an essential pillar of the multilateral trade system through the Doha Round is currently proving to be a myth. It was necessary to initiate the Doha Round negotiations to remedy the inequalities caused by the Uruguay Round, which focused on the interests of the rich countries to the detriment of the developing and least developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the level of development of the participating countries has not been taken into account throughout the entire duration of the current negotiations either. Indeed, before granting some concessions on agricultural subsidies, the industrialised countries asked the developing countries for reciprocity in other areas.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to make development more than a principle promoted for show in the Doha Round, products originating from less developed countries need to be given access to the market, free of customs duties and quotas, in keeping with the decision adopted during the Hong Kong Conference in 2005. Other requirements include ensuring special, differential treatment for developing countries, the removal by developed countries of export subsidies for cotton, improved preferential certificates of origin applicable to imports from the least developed countries, as well as greater financial input from the United States and the European Union in the area of Aid for Trade.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The very credibility of the World Trade Organisation in managing global governance depends on the success of the Doha Round. The WTO is at risk of being reduced to nothing more than an ineffective talking shop. The challenges we are faced with, such as the sovereign debt crisis, the alarming unemployment rate, volatile food prices, illegal trade and climate change require global management.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I think that the multilateral trade system needs to be reviewed so that the development objectives proposed by the Doha programme can be achieved via the WTO and the links between trade and global challenges can be dealt with more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, stepping up the cooperation between the WTO and other international organisations and agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation or the UN environmental and development programmes could help establish international standards which would tackle not only the commercial but also the social, development and environmental concerns.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I would like to highlight the need for greater democracy and transparency in what the WTO does. If we really want to achieve free trade and economic globalisation under fair conditions, we need to give greater consideration to a number of factors which are essential for achieving an economic balance, such as the need to encourage exchanges, especially involving technology and innovation, and averting the damaging impact on citizens’ quality of life and on the environment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, some of us were in Doha when we launched the Doha Round. We are well aware that the Round was, in a way, stillborn: it had so many contradictions in its genes that it could not succeed, but it was the international situation – it was just after 11 September – that ultimately forced all the countries to sign in Doha.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are seeing above all today is not a crisis of confidence within the international community, but a crisis of globalisation. We need to stop thinking about ever more liberalisation and focus instead, of course, on regulation, in a world in which every one of us today can see the damage caused by the globalisation of trade, whether it be from an environmental point of view or from a social point of view.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What kind of economy does Europe want to create for itself? How can we put a stop to environmental, social, fiscal and monetary dumping? How can we ensure that people can exercise their trade union freedom throughout the world without restriction? How can Europe make global trade dependent on the recognition and exercise of trade union freedom? These are the questions that we need to be asking ourselves today, that Europe needs to ask itself when it operates within a multilateral framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must acknowledge that the Doha Round is finished, adopt a package that is limited and restricted to the least developed countries and, above all, launch an ambitious and transparent process for reforming the World Trade Organisation, one that guarantees the fair participation of all stakeholders and safeguards the interests of the weakest countries in particular, that makes trade law subject to social legislation, environmental law and, of course, human rights, and that actually promotes a multilateral regulatory agenda that puts globalisation back where it belongs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the crisis of profitability of capital, its unprecedented degree of centralisation and concentration and the associated downward trend in profit margins reflect dynamics in the advance of capitalism that have long been studied and described.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Free trade, over the last two decades, has been one of the pillars of the neo-liberal response to the systemic crisis in capitalism. It is a response that panders to the interests of major corporations and the major powers, by seeking to ensure that they have access to new markets, greater availability of manpower, a reduction in unit labour costs and easy access to raw materials, that is, better conditions for exploiting workers and nature.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This has meant, and still means more profits for those major corporations, without doubt; but for the workers and people the promised wonders of free trade, much vaunted by its advocates who are well represented in the Commission and this Parliament, have never materialised; on the contrary, what we are faced with is the destruction and relocation of productive activities and jobs, an attack on social and employment rights, the ruin of millions of small producers and many small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the destruction of the environment and natural resources. This is the path of Doha. It is a path which urgently needs to be redirected in the interests of the workers and the peoples of Europe and the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">International trade must be geared towards establishing fair and equitable relationships that are mutually beneficial; it must be based on relationships of complementarity, and not on competition between producer countries and the workforce. It must support the development of peoples and countries, and not just a few economic and financial groups.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, no progress has been made in the Doha negotiations. The Commissioner communicated this fact quite clearly. Originally, 2010 was supposed to be the year of breakthrough, but now that has changed to this year, 2011. However, we are still not seeing any real success in getting the Doha Round going. Even a minimum package for the least developed countries seems an unrealistic prospect. The failure of Doha would harm international trade and promote protectionism. Therefore, everyone will have to make concessions to give this round a chance of success.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I asked a question almost two years ago during a similar debate, namely whether the WTO’s negotiating system had managed to keep adequate pace with globalisation.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the principle of ‘fair trade rather than free trade in which double standards apply’ has been a key, carefully considered concern for many Europeans of a wide variety of political hues. I am also one of those who was involved in the Doha process 10 years ago as a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Our current position is a very bitter pill to swallow, because it is apparent that we cannot achieve results without clear European guidelines for sustainability – we have started to hear talk of ‘resilience’ or even a rollback – without embracing human rights and openness in trade. A number of points have been made. With regard to the common agricultural policy, it would be hypocritical of the EU to enter these negotiations. It is difficult to accept that something similar is not happening there.</p>
      <p sl="de">When Mr Caspary tells us: ‘we need a strong WTO’, we do not always remember to ask what a strong WTO actually means and what it would look like.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we support the WTO as the guardian of a rules-based international trading system and the role which it can play in terms of managing globalisation in a transparent and optimum manner. However imperfect the arrangements put in place by the World Trade Organisation may be, they are preferable to no arrangements at all and they are certainly preferable to an anarchic trading system.</p>
      <p sl="el">As such, we are in favour of completing the Doha negotiations under an ambitious, broad, cohesive and balanced agreement. Of course, it is now clear that it will be impossible to reach an agreement in 2011. Under no circumstances must it be at any cost to the Union, which has made ambitious concessions and ambitious offers.</p>
      <p sl="el">The countries shaping up as emerging economies must bear their share of responsibility as global players and must make concessions commensurate with their level of development and competitiveness. Of course, developing countries need to be differentiated for the benefit of the least developed countries (LDCs), for whose benefit a broad package of – if possible – immediately applicable measures should be agreed.</p>
      <p sl="el">As far as agricultural negotiations are concerned, I would stress that agriculture is not simply an economic activity; it also helps to generate basic public requirements, such as food adequacy and food safety. Be that as it may, regardless of the outcome of the Doha Round, and possibly following the reform of the WTO, the need for which we have heard argued in this Chamber, the WTO will need to respond to the new global challenges and we shall need to safeguard the credibility of the multilateral trading system.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I think that we need to adopt a stance that will kick-start the Doha Development Agenda, which has only been, so far, an attempt at a global level to place the development process at the heart of the multilateral trade system. Therefore, I believe that developed countries have to give greater consideration to the needs of and imbalances in the developing countries and ensure that they receive special, differential treatment, in line with previous agreements, including a services waiver and a different monitoring mechanism. New investments are required to boost economic recovery and the stability of the developing countries, many of which have been affected by domestic crises and disastrous conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I call on the European Commission to continue to support the achievement of the ambitious objectives envisaged in the Doha Ministerial Declaration in 2001, as well as the commitments adopted at the World Trade Organisation’s Hong Kong Ministerial Conference held in 2005, by promoting development as a key objective of the Doha Development Agenda.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also think that, in the current climate, the European Union can and must play a more active role, mediating between the different positions of the members of the World Trade Organisation. In this respect, I would like to remind you that Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty on the consistency of development policies obliges the European Union to consider the impact of trade and other policies on developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Looking ahead to the Eighth WTO meeting in Geneva, the most suitable solutions must be identified for addressing the main challenges facing these states so that trade stimulates sustainable development. Especially when it comes to restrictions on natural resource exports, they need to be regulated comprehensively by international trade rules. These wealthy assets are the main source of income for many developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must also point out the impact on emerging economies. I believe that it is appropriate for us to reissue our appeal to these states to assume their responsibility as major global players and to make concessions commensurate with their level of development and sectoral competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The changes over the last decade, triggered and influenced by the economic crisis, may have an adverse impact on the Doha Round which needs to be adapted more dynamically to the new global situation. The lack of food security, caused by huge price rises and climate change, is one of the key factors that need to be borne in mind in this respect. As far as subsidies are concerned, those supporting the agricultural sector in developing countries and those supporting exports for developed countries have a negative impact, which requires a solution to be found that will not affect the economic balances within and between these countries.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, let me emphasise one positive thing about the Doha negotiations. It allowed developing countries to sit down at the negotiating table – they knew what they wanted and they stood firm. However, that was the only positive, because they did not end up getting what they were entitled to.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have not had enough involvement with any of them over the last decade and, as a result, a whole raft of bilateral agreements have been signed in the meantime. Bilateral agreements between Western countries, including the European Union, and developing countries have led to these countries being played off against each other. It is essential that we work towards multilateral agreements, but I fear that we are not going to see that happen in Geneva. Why not? Because the players at the table, Europe headed by Mr De Gucht, and the WTO headed by Mr Lamy, have sent out a message over the last decade that we are not prepared to give developing countries their rights. I therefore hope that we, here, will speak out in favour of the completion of the Doha negotiations and in favour of changes being made at the WTO.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner De Gucht, I would like to wish you the best of luck in Geneva and for the remaining negotiations. You confirmed Europe’s commitment to the multilateral trade negotiations, to the World Trade Organisation and to the Doha Round. After all, even though we may have an ambitious programme for bilateral free trade negotiations, we all know that it is only the multilateral, global agreements that can provide the growth and free trade that we know we need.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is rather tiresome to have these debates on the Doha Round over and over again. I have been in the European Parliament for seven years and debates and discussions on the Doha Round have come up time and again. There are always new hopes and new disappointments – it would be easy to give up, but the Doha Round is too important for us to let it go.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Doha Round was launched straight after the dreadful terrorist attacks on 11 September 10 years ago. I have to say that this is one of the few really good responses to the horrors that happened at that time – a response that is about global cooperation and bringing prosperity to the world’s poor. It is no less important now than it was then.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the one hand, we could say that the Doha Round is more important than ever now with the debt crisis pervading both Europe and the US. We can expect lower rates of growth, perhaps even a recession, in large parts of the world. We know that it will affect Europe. However, the world’s poor will be hardest hit. It is therefore more important than ever to ensure that we do something to give the global economy a real boost.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the other hand, the Doha Round is a little out of date. It concerns duties, and it mainly concerns agriculture and to a minor extent industrial goods. At the same time, we all know that the economy is characterised today by services, by the digital economy and not by peripheral barriers to trade. It is therefore important to bring this to a conclusion. It is important for people’s confidence in the global trade system and in the WTO and a global regulatory framework, but it is also important in order to enable us to deal with future challenges – new trade regulations for a new economy – an economy that is digital in nature and characterised by services. Everyone will benefit from an agreement. It would be the single most important and best boost for new growth throughout the world. However, this requires leadership – courageous political leadership. Here in the European Parliament, we do not expect anything else of the Commission and of Commissioner De Gucht than to simply have the courage to demonstrate this leadership in the negotiations. We need more free trade in the world, not less, in times of crisis.</p>

      <p sl="hu">… the motion for a resolution is a very interesting document as it is much more honest and hence more pessimistic than many of its predecessors. Not quite as pessimistic, however, as the article published recently in an international journal by former United States chief negotiator Susan Schwab, with a title suggesting that the Doha Round was dead. According to the former chief negotiator, the Doha Round has died because the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was unable to keep pace with the major changes that have taken place in the world over the past 10 years. For example, it has failed to keep pace with changes linked to the growing economic importance of China and Brazil. The author believes that China, Brazil and all the other countries that have hitherto benefited substantially from the WTO should make much greater concessions in order to help the least developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The WTO has also failed to take account of the changes that have taken place in climate policy in the past 10 years. It is very difficult to envisage any new system of trade regulations that does not address climate protection issues. Despite the increasing scarcity of resources worldwide, the WTO is incapable of taking effective action against countries that restrict access to resource markets by imposing export restrictions. There is another important issue that has been referred to in several of today’s speeches: as the number of starving people grows, food security is also becoming an increasingly important global issue. This, too, needs to be addressed in the WTO context. It may not be possible to conclude the Doha Round, but this does not spell the end of the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The WTO will not necessarily cease to operate. WTO regulations currently in force will continue to apply. These regulations need to be enforced much more rigorously, as many of those who have benefited on the whole from the WTO are the worst offenders when it comes to violating WTO regulations. Let us now focus on implementing the existing regulations, especially with regard to export restrictions. It is unacceptable that some parties impose export limits, for example on rare earth metals. If it does indeed prove impossible to finalise WTO negotiations and conclude the Doha Round, there are many other options for expanding European Union trade by way of bilateral, balanced reciprocal trade agreements.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations on a reform of the World Trade Organisation can be characterised as truly exhausting. There is still no sign of the talks coming to a conclusion anytime soon. On Wednesday, this House will witness the adoption of a cross-group resolution clearly favouring a multilateral trade system rather than more bilateral agreements. During the course of the Doha negotiations, the European Union has made concessions in many areas, taking significant steps to close the gap with its negotiating partners.</p>
      <p sl="de">I genuinely hope that the European Union will strongly support a functional and dynamic World Trade Organisation. Commissioner, this is something that lies mainly in your hands. Above all, a global trade system with a clear set of rules must enable us to offer less developed countries the support they so desperately need. Slipping increasingly into a pattern of bilateral agreements is the wrong path to take.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am sceptical about this development, particularly in the context of European agriculture. We must not forget that many European countries have an agricultural system built around small structures. Measures to support the market have always been, and continue to be, a key component in retaining regionalism and rural life. Food safety is a central concern, particularly in Europe. However, there is no disputing the importance of the SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) standards and the TRIPS (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) agreement for the European economy. The same applies to price fluctuations in the commodities and food sector. These problems cannot be resolved on a regional or bilateral basis, but need global solutions. We need a solid, sustainable and well-balanced trade system rather than a series of cobbled-together trade agreements.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am hopeful of some positive developments during the next round of talks and that you will continue to press for a conclusion. Good luck!</p>

      <p sl="it">I can assure you that over the next 10 weeks Commissioner De Gucht and his staff will step up their efforts and contacts, and the Commissioner has instructed me to tell you that he will be pleased to hold further talks on the future of Doha in the Committee on International Trade. Unfortunately, as the Presidency said, much to his regret, Commissioner De Gucht has had to leave the Chamber in order to catch a flight to South Africa for the summit and the bilateral trade talks.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can only reiterate the importance of Doha when it comes to keeping the world markets open, improving the functioning of markets that are already open, and opening the market still further in line with the requirements of a world economy in the era of globalisation, with a number of steadily growing stakeholders, and in a context in which not everyone carries the same economic weight. However, I repeat that the Commission will do everything in its power to ensure that the economy can benefit from the conclusion of the Doha Agreements.</p>

      <p sl="sk">International trade cannot in itself be evaluated positively or negatively. It is an instrument, the results of which are dependent on their application. I am of the view that international trade should not purely be a tool for achieving profits and a platform for a competitive battle between countries where the stronger one often wins. It should also be a developmental instrument. I will therefore hope that at the December Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation this position will be promoted not only by representatives of the so-called developing economies, but also by representatives of the EU. Development must be central to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). In this regard, I appreciate the fact that the draft EP resolution from the Committee on International Trade received similar requirements. Besides the fact that development should come under the spotlight of the Doha Development Agenda, the resolution also sets out the need for sustainable development. I agree that it is important to improve access to environmental goods and technologies, and it will therefore be necessary to reduce or eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services. If international trade is to develop in this direction, that is to say towards equitable and sustainable development, it will certainly also have fewer critics.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to remind the Commission that the European Parliament called, just last year, for strict compliance with the negotiation mandate granted by the Council as part of the Doha Development Agenda. I also wish to remind the Commission that the debates on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013 need to be concluded, prior to submitting new proposals to our trade partners. I think that the European Union has already made enough concessions on agriculture, including the reduction in support for farmers. Unfortunately, the same concessions were not adopted by other states involved in the negotiations, and it is also a similar scenario with the relevant food safety and quality rules. This puts European producers at a disadvantage at a global level. The Doha negotiations are a serious responsibility for the Commission which I am calling on once again to give agriculture the attention it requires.</p>

      <p sl="de">For nine years, industrialised, emerging and developing nations have been haggling over further liberalisation of world trade in the Doha Round. The EU is showing the most willingness to compromise in the current negotiations: thus, 64% of the concessions in the agricultural sector came from Brussels. In exchange, the EU can expect only 8% of the profits. The United States will contribute a mere 6%, but can expect 13% of the profits. The biggest winner is Brazil – with absolutely no concessions, this emerging economy will profit all the more from the opening up of the markets in the other WTO states. There is clear inequality here. When making its generous concessions, the EU must not forget its own farmers. European farmers need support and protection in order to survive. It would be better to rely on regional self-sufficiency than indirectly to support the big farms in Brazil.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Reinhard Bütikofer, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on an effective raw materials strategy for Europe (2011/2056(INI)) (A7-0288/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-072-000" speaker_id="96739" name="Reinhard BÜTIKOFER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="26-01-1953" birth_place="Mannheim" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude for the cooperation of all the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and my colleagues from many other committees, in particular the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as well as the Commission and the many people from civil society and the worlds of business and science who participated in this process.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that raw materials policy is one of the major challenges for industrial policy. However, it is also one of our greatest opportunities. This is a subject that has become very close to my heart in the last 18 months. I am certain that a very prudent yet ambitious innovation strategy will bring us great success, if we focus our efforts there. Resource efficiency, re-use, recycling or even substitution – these are the key strategies available to us and we should base our future competitiveness on precisely this strategy of innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly: setting targets without considering the instruments available to achieve them is rarely a recipe for getting results. That is why it is particularly important that we should think hard about the question and reach specific agreements among ourselves about how to organise cooperation between the Member States and between the Member States and the Commission and genuinely assume responsibility. Effective governance is the key here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mineral raw materials are at least as important as oil or gas or other natural energy sources, however they are not given the same attention in European cooperation; this is something that has to change.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this report we have indicated a whole series of instruments that will enable us to strengthen governance. We propose a risk radar. We want the Commission to update its list of critical raw materials and to analyse the supply chains. We want a study to be carried out on critical raw materials, such as lithium, which are not currently on the list, but which are of strategic importance. We propose establishing a competency network for rare earths. We are very keen that the initiative of the Commission for an innovation partnership on raw materials efficiency, which has been blocked by some Member States, should finally be given a chance. We want a high-level task force to be established to give strategic coherence to the activities of the various players – the Directorates General, the Joint Research Centre, the European Environment Agency, the European External Action Service and others. We want a raw materials road map by 2050 and an annual progress report for the European Parliament, and we also want to see the laws that we have in the area of recycling, for example in relation to electronic waste, actually being implemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, this report also deals with the external aspects of raw materials policy. The principle I apply here is that we should pursue a reliable strategy of foreign cooperation both with poorer resource-rich countries – in Africa for example – and with strong resource-rich countries. The point here is that Europe, which imports more raw materials per capita than any other region of the world, should take a responsible stance with a raw materials strategy based on cooperation. This means, for example, that when deciding on investments for the extraction of resources in third countries, the European Investment Bank and the Commission should check whether such projects are embedded in a strategy to combat poverty and promote development. Accordingly, transparency laws should be drafted in line with the US model of the Dodd-Frank Act or the publish-what-you-pay principle. This means that development policy is not made subservient to raw materials interests, but rather accepts the raw materials sovereignty of our partners, while at the same time intervening to prevent distortion and promoting cooperation in the common interest.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am certain that, on this basis, the EU will be able to make a very positive contribution to international raw materials governance in the many international bodies that already exist.</p>

    <intervention id="1-073-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to thank Mr Bütikofer for the text he has drafted, and this is not just a matter of form. I also wish to thank all the Members who have tabled opinions on the report, because the result achieved is an extremely positive one in my view, and is in harmony with the European Commission’s efforts to strategically address the extremely important issue of raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="it">Why do I say that this report has convinced me, and why do I say that it is in harmony with the European Commission’s strategy and hence strengthens, politically, the joint action and cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in this extremely important area? Firstly, because the report considers the problems and the opportunities that we may have from every angle; secondly, because it strikes the right balance between the various political options; and thirdly, because it contains practical and extremely interesting suggestions and recommendations that contribute to the development and improvement of a strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I said at the beginning of my speech that I felt that cooperation between Parliament and the Commission was crucial. We have been working for several months now with Mr Bütikofer, and with many other Members, too; I am thinking of the ‘raw materials club’, which was the initiative of Members from various political groups – Mr Rübig, Mr Florenz, Ms Merkies, Mr Bütikofer – and of the recent proposal by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to launch a pilot project in 2012 aimed at the creation of a network of experts on rare earths. I think that this proposal could also make an excellent contribution to the future partnership on raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear why the political involvement of all the institutions has become crucial; your report explains this point very well. One piece of information that I feel is particularly significant and which struck me this morning when I was reading the report on my way from Munich to Strasbourg is the part that helps give us a concrete idea of how the supply of raw materials is hindering the competitiveness of our businesses; it struck me when Mr Bütikofer wrote that raw material cost as a proportion of total production cost is far higher than workers’ payroll cost and that the trend is for an increase in all sectors in the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to focus now on a few fundamental aspects of this strategy, the three different pillars of which – supply outside the EU, supply within the EU, and resource efficiency, recycling and substitution – are, in my view, vital elements, and I am convinced as well as pleased that Parliament agrees with this.</p>
      <p sl="it">Innovation is vital in order to make progress in each of the sectors covered by the EU raw materials strategy, which has to include the entire value chain, from prospecting to extraction, processing, recycling and substitution, in order to be complete.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, the launch of an innovation partnership on raw materials may also act as an important incentive to help ensure that real progress is made. I am even more optimistic than Mr Bütikofer: it seems to me that, more than resistance, the reservations and misgivings of some Member States have now been overcome, not least because the Competitiveness Council has given the green light to this initiative of ours, and so I believe that the important thing now is to focus on how we can work together on this innovation partnership.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other topic that was addressed in the report, and also in Mr Bütikofer’s speech, concerns raw materials diplomacy: ongoing attention must be paid to these materials in our international relations, both from a trade point of view and from the point of view of other aspects. Together with the United States and Japan, we have taken the first steps towards closer cooperation in this sector. As part of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy and the Joint Africa-EU Action Plan, the African Union and the European Union have pledged to work towards a coherent approach to the development of raw materials extraction activities with the aim of supporting Africa’s capabilities at national, subregional and continental level.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Africa-EU High Level Conference on Raw Materials, to be held on 1 December, will provide the political impetus needed to take this partnership forward. Russia and Latin America are two other fronts on which we are working – I will be in Moscow at the end of October, and I was in Chile in June. We have signed an agreement with Chile, and I am endeavouring to have it signed by Argentina and Brazil in the next few months, before the end of the year. Let us remember that Chile is one of the main producers of lithium, and very high-quality lithium at that – it is perhaps the best in the world. The country’s relationship with the European Union has been welcomed very enthusiastically, as was also highlighted by a meeting held with the Republic’s president and its entire government, precisely in order to emphasise the importance of the strategic raw materials agreement with the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards sustainability, we must pursue our efforts to reconcile extraction activities with high environmental protection requirements. Clearly, in order to reconcile these elements, we need to base our efforts on a research and innovation policy, but success in this area also depends on the way in which we formulate policies on access to earths and on the promotion of environmentally friendly mineral extraction activities. For this reason, I am working extremely closely with Commissioner Potočnik also. This is an area that largely comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States, but the Commission may be able to act as a facilitator. Of course the ultimate responsibility lies, I repeat, with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, next week we shall be adopting the flagship initiative on resource efficiency, in which various practical solutions will be provided, particularly regarding recycling.</p>
      <p sl="it">The examples that I mentioned concern only a few cases, and I wish to tell Parliament that I am also working hard with the Swedish Government, which held an important meeting on raw materials extraction in the Barents Sea in this very Chamber a few months ago, before the summer recess. I am in contact with Minister Bildt and I will be travelling to Sweden so that we can work together. I also wish to inform Parliament that I have also met with the new prime minister of Greenland, and we are already working on my visit to Greenland to address the issue of raw materials. There is a positive desire on the part of Greenland to work with us to address and explore a raw materials strategy that will apply in the long term also.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is everything that we are doing, and I shall say it again: I consider this strong relationship with Parliament to be extremely important. It will play a crucial role, especially when it comes to the development of a robust strategy that provides practical solutions for industry without causing environmental damage. I apologise if I have taken longer than planned, but this is such an important issue that it merits an in-depth debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, as is customary here in Parliament, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Bütikofer sincerely for this report. As standing rapporteur for Policy Coherence for Development I am very, very grateful to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for taking on board many of the proposals of the Committee on Development. As Mr Bütikofer has already stated, the raw materials issue is extremely important: the United Nations forecasts a growth in demand for raw materials of 300% by 2050.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, this discussion is also important in the context of coherent development policy. Let me give you an example: dubious accounting practices among international raw materials companies and inadequate contracts with these companies mean that developing countries are losing an estimated USD 80 to 160 billion every year. Compare this with the development aid provided by the European Union, which amounts to 8 billion per year. In this context, our aid is like a drop of water hitting a sizzling hot stone.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is so important that the report should refer clearly to transparency initiatives like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Because these initiatives can only bear fruit in the long term, I welcome offers of concrete help as part of the Joint Africa EU Strategy Action Plan 2011-2013, for example with the negotiation of contracts with raw materials companies. According to estimates, every single euro spent in this way generates added value of 10 euro and I believe we can say that this would be more effective aid than cosmetic measures taken at a later date.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Bütikofer, I too wish to start by expressing my thanks for this ambitious report and the huge amount of work it has entailed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Tajani, raw materials policy is essential to the development of European industry. The trade dimension is decisive, which is why I believe it is right for raw materials policy to be anchored in an international context from the perspective of industrial policy in Europe. A number of points are key here: If we intend to secure our supply of raw materials in the world by means of partnership agreements, we can only do this by ensuring that the businesses that extract these raw materials also conduct themselves in a reasonable way. It is unacceptable for European businesses to evade tax or for workers to be required to work under inhuman conditions. That is why it is clear that if we intend to mine raw materials, then businesses need to comply with clear social and environmental standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we must also ensure that the raw materials that we use do not come from crisis regions and are not used to finance groups who use the money earned from raw materials to fund civil war. We need an international certification system for the extraction of raw materials and for tracing trade, so that we can tell where raw materials come from. By the way, excellent footprints can be found for raw materials everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we must ensure that we do not export raw materials illegally. In our own interests, we need to close any loopholes in our legislation – this last remark is addressed to Mr Florenz. However, we also need to improve controls. The system will never work if a single individual is to be required to ensure controls in a large European port. Exports need closer monitoring and it is necessary to ensure that monopolistic and oligopolistic structures in raw materials trade are eliminated. The good news, Commissioner, is that the Commission is moving in the right direction.</p>

I am of the view that we have a very useful document here. To be honest, I think that we could take this a lot further. It is a very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When we look at the current economic and financial crisis, what tends to get overlooked is the fact that the next crisis is already looming in its wake, a crisis that we could prevent right now, if we had the right strategy. I am talking about the shortage of raw materials – things which all the emerging economies would obviously also like to get their hands on – a shortage which is already putting our future growth, once this crisis is over, under pressure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What really pleases me is that this report pays a lot of attention to this weakness of the EU, to the fact that we are currently so dependent. It is also good that we are focusing on our own strengths. How are we dealing with our own waste? What else could we still do internally, within Europe? The report contains a call for innovation, which is essential if we are to succeed in keeping raw materials within our own territory and reprocessing them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The only problem is that we need to flesh out what exactly we mean by innovation, because the definition in the report is not yet concrete enough. What exactly do we mean by that? Where is the actual paradigm shift that Europe has been clamouring for, as a response, certainly, to this financial and economic crisis and as a response to the many different ways in which we are dependent? We need a behavioural change, a shift in industry and amongst the citizens themselves. How can we achieve that? We need a totally different economic model. I am not talking here about just the governance structures of banks or governments. No, what I actually mean is substantial intervention in the economy: for example, a ‘lease’ society, where all products automatically come back to us in another form. This would, however, be a genuine redistribution of our burden: it would, for example, provide that extra little incentive that is necessary to get us to purchase higher-quality, more sustainable and more environmentally friendly products; much more stringent ecodesign guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will be particularly pleased with what you have to say if you say that we have to do everything in a way which shows respect for nature. Because that is really important. We tend to opt far too quickly for virgin land, those nature reserves that could still be used for mining, but who says that urban dwellers cannot provide for themselves from the goldmines in their cities? Yes, we are already living on top of a goldmine of waste, and that could turn out to be our urban mine. We could be living on top of a source of something that we could use. Let us therefore first of all concentrate on those areas, and not just on virgin land.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All of you have come up with sound proposals − proposals which I, indeed, hope will become a reality, such as the quality mark, the chain of custody, the concept of ultimate responsibility, proper social labelling, paying more attention to illegal shipments out of Europe and, above all, a great deal of innovation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, first of all, I would like to welcome the Commission Communication on raw materials and the proposal to devise a new European Union strategy in this area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I want to emphasise that particular attention must be focused on agricultural commodities, given the need to ensure global supply security. We are facing a series of problems relating to agricultural raw materials, whether we are talking not only about the extreme volatility of markets and prices and the dwindling global food stocks, but also about the shortcomings in the food chain. We must also bear in mind that the European Union’s strategy needs to take into account factors such as the export barriers. With this in mind, these issues have to be clarified beforehand within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that the European Union’s future strategy will take into account all the specific features of agricultural raw materials and markets and will be effective in guaranteeing supply security.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we are discussing a report that the Commission presented when the occasion arose on the strategy for tackling a matter of special importance, namely, the volatility of prices of raw materials and the increase in demand for raw materials on the part of developing countries, especially China.</p>
      <p sl="es">For my group’s part, we wish to express our thanks for the Bütikofer report and to say that to a very large degree we share the views expressed in it because we consider that it develops, brings into focus and adopts a truly satisfactory approach to raw materials and the strategy for their use, access and development. In that sense, we think that the report we are debating adopts a balanced approach to access to raw materials both within and outside the EU, raw materials which are fundamental and critical. We think that adequate emphasis is placed on the importance of using sources of raw materials efficiently, and that a number of very interesting proposals are put forward for improving recycling practices in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, I would like to point out on behalf of my group that in our opinion, bearing in mind that maintaining growth is fundamental, the issue should not be tackled from the point of view of reducing consumption. Economic growth must be maintained and promoted and, accordingly, what we need to consider are policies for efficient use of these raw materials and policies that truly incentivise rational use of the same. Likewise, we believe that the impact on speculation will be positive because, as a result of the transparency measures proposed by the Commission, we will face a more transparent market than the one in which we find ourselves today and, accordingly, one with reduced scope for speculation.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, firstly, I would like to say that I am in complete agreement with Ms Merkies, Mr Lange and the rapporteur, Mr Bütikofer. They have already said that the efficient use of resources, recycling and urban mining are extremely important investments in jobs and growth and in the protection and management of our environment, but with innovation, a modern way of thinking and a modern form of action as the tools to achieve this. At the same time, I would like to highlight a completely different perspective that is crucial to the electorate that I represent in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The first thing I did when Parliament began working on issues relating to raw materials was to travel to one of the main centres for raw materials in Europe, namely Norrbotten in northern Sweden. There I met the real experts who know what raw materials mean for growth, jobs and industrial development. I spoke to researchers, industry representatives and the trade unions. They described how this age-old sector is now blooming once again, how new mines are being opened and old mines revived, how prospecting is being carried out, techniques are being developed and quality is being improved. This is a result of global demand increasing once again. Globalisation has quite simply returned to Europe. Demand is coming from the world outside Europe, while at the same time we need to succeed in supplying our own industry. This is extremely exciting. I have to say to Commissioner Tajani that there is no need to go to Greenland. We have the whole of northern Europe, where there is a great deal of advanced technology, research, high-quality raw materials and a working environment that is also very good for those who work in this section of the industry. I believe that we can do a great deal more of this without needing to look further north to start with.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also see the raw materials strategy as recognition by the EU of the crucial role that northern Europe plays with regard to industrial development and prosperity. That is important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, one of the most important lessons I learned from my visit to northern Sweden was the importance of a well-functioning infrastructure, both for regions rich in raw materials and for centres of industry. That is vital for effective and green growth.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With this report, Parliament is demanding that the new guidelines for the EU’s Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) infrastructure programme take account of the need to link raw material resources to industrial centres. The Commission must listen to this and come up with specific proposals.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another important issue is of course the prospects for development, which several other speakers have already mentioned. A key starting point is that extraction of raw materials and trade with countries outside the EU must, of course, be based on equal partnerships. We must not contribute to a development that involves supporting a regression to neocolonial times, a return to the old colonial era. That is a route we must not go down. We do not need to, as there are enormous riches and many good partnerships for us to enter into.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Europe is facing one of its most testing times yet. As we Europeans find ourselves in an increasingly globalised world, we face the dual challenge of securing European prosperity and fighting climate change. Over the coming decades we need to restructure the European economy in order to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for the whole continent. These are challenges acknowledged in the EU's jobs and growth strategy, the 2020 Strategy, and they should also be at the forefront of a successful raw materials strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The challenges should not be underestimated. According to some estimates, investment needs for transport, energy, ICT and other sectors will amount to EUR 4 000 billion up to 2050. To achieve this, a secure supply of raw materials is the key to a future where Europe leads the world in green technology. As economies go greener they also increasingly compete for the same key raw materials, many of which we must import from competing world powers.</p>
      <p sl="de">The raw materials strategy needs to be connected – or more connected – to other important European policies, for example on industry, research, trade, transport and sustainable economic growth. Especially at this time of crisis, we need real growth- orientated reforms based on encouraging free trade. Tying a raw materials strategy based on free trade closer to other EU policies will enhance access to raw materials for European companies as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">Apart from being green and trade-oriented, the EU raw materials strategy must also ensure that both developed and developing countries can benefit from the sustainable supply of materials. It is crucial that the capacity of developing countries is strengthened using the ‘Aid for Trade’ mechanism. Special attention must be paid to fragile states and post-conflict situations in order to ensure that raw materials are not used to escalate or finance conflict.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe needs actions aimed at innovation and eliminating trade barriers in third countries, not a policy of stockpiling rare and critical raw materials while undermining democracy abroad.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe should also take advantage of the materials that we have here. Contrary to frequent assertions, Europe is still rich in natural resources and, with its minerals, metals and forests, Northern Europe in particular has the potential to meet many of the EU’s raw material needs in a sustainable way, provided there is transport.</p>
      <p sl="de">If sound and strategic management of our own resources can be coupled with real reform of the internal market, we will be well on our way to being a competitive player in tomorrow’s global green economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report. Thank you, also, Commissioner Tajani, for your comments on the report. It seems that we all agree. This is a great strategy for safeguarding raw materials. Perhaps I should be being a little more critical, because, if I compare this report to the Commission’s original report, I, in fact, see that there are considerable discrepancies between the two. I am pleased that Mr Tajani is now happy with the European Parliament’s report, but what we are dealing with here is a different strategy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When I read the Commission’s report, what it mainly focused on was fighting China for raw materials and bringing them into Europe as soon as possible. If that failed, we were to quickly move onto exploiting European mines. Number three was that, oh yes, we should be dealing with raw materials slightly more efficiently. That is precisely the wrong order in which to do things, and this report makes that obvious.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First and foremost, we ourselves must be much more efficient in dealing with our natural resources. A very simple example is recycling. If we mine one tonne, we will probably find, on average, five grams of gold. However, if we look at one tonne of electronic waste, there is 150 grams of gold to be found there. That is a much more intelligent, much cheaper and more efficient way of sourcing our raw materials. Recycling is also – as you, as the Commissioner of Industry must know – a branch of European industry which needs to be promoted, here in Europe, above anywhere else. Reusing our own resources that have already been on the market. That is a clever policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we really have to go on mining, let us avoid Natura 2000 areas completely. This report makes that quite clear. You say that we obviously need to take the environment into account. I want that to be made more stringent. We do not, therefore, want to interfere with Natura 2000 areas, but I do not want Europe to go into the North Pole either. That would at least be a concrete policy, instead of vague words.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, if we really have to import raw materials from outside Europe, contact with developing countries would be in order. That is where diplomacy comes in. However, I want to see this policy reflected throughout the Commission, including by the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, because a consistent European foreign policy is, unfortunately, still a long way off.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I give my thanks to the rapporteur for the report which I read with great interest. I followed this report as shadow rapporteur for the opinion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the debate there quite rightly centred around some very specific areas in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is absolutely clear that we need to consider strategies for reducing the use of, and increasing the recycling of, these scarce raw materials, but we also need to make sure that we do not over-complicate the issue. A strategy is a strategy and the title of this report is ‘an effective strategy’. We need to be aware that we could become too prescriptive at this stage. We need to leave our options open whilst agreeing our broad strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Take, for example, urban mining. This is a great concept. I come from a country with a very long history of landfill, and I am sure there is a great deal in there that we could very usefully use, but we need to be careful. Landfill creates greenhouse gases, we all know that; that is why we are trying to avoid it. Old landfills are sealed, they can create noxious gases, sometimes poisonous gases, so we must be very careful before we move forward with this strategy, and we must have good and careful impact assessments in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Likewise, the issue of stockpiling, referred to here, must be approached with caution. Much of the debate around this subject has centred on the distortions of supply in the market and on speculation – market manipulation. This is all open to debate, but I believe that the last thing we need to do in response to that concern is to talk about stockpiling, because that is a manipulation of the market, and there is absolutely no guarantee – without much further thought and much further examination – that this will take us any further forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Broadly, I welcome the report. I thank the rapporteur once again and I look forward to working together on a raw material strategy as the years go by because this is clearly just the beginning of a long road.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would also like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work he has done in describing the current needs of European industry in relation to raw materials, and also on the emphasis placed on the associated environmental risks and on recycling strategies. I think that these are all positive points, among others, in the report presented to this Chamber. However, I think that we must bear in mind what the Commission is proposing, and I cannot agree in any way with the model being presented, the so-called ‘raw materials diplomacy’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This proposal, together with the proposal to establish a monitoring mechanism at the level of the G8 or the G20, in my view reinforces a division, a new division, or it reinforces the division of the world into industrialised countries with raw material requirements, as we all know – and these are legitimate requirements – on the one hand, and on the other, poor countries that are rich in raw materials, but which do not even have access to them. We know that, in the European industrial context, forces exist which want to ensure the supply of these raw materials by whatever means necessary. This vision of the world is a step backwards, a way of thinking from the past, and Europe should have learnt by now, because we have at least 500 years’ experience in this area. There are therefore no guarantees that the raw materials diplomacy model will not turn into diplomatic blackmail. The developing countries and their populations must have a right to their own resources. I think that we should be talking about a new development model that is more innovative, as has already been mentioned, and that the focus of the European External Action Service must be cooperation and not the diplomacy of business.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Commissioner, as the report of Mr Bütikofer states, European industry is encountering ever greater difficulties when obtaining the raw materials needed for innovative production.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The rapid industrial growth in countries in the developing world, especially in Asia and South America, has increased demand for raw materials, precious metals and rare earth elements, increasing their price and restricting their availability for European industry.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, large quantities of used industrial products considered as waste, which often contain precious metals or materials which are difficult to obtain from abroad, have long been concentrated in Europe. Therefore, in addition to finding new options for obtaining raw materials, either through trade diplomacy or cooperation in revealing new production capacity, we must, I believe, be more orientated towards exploiting the potential of waste recycling.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should no longer consider recyclable industrial waste to be purely worthless contamination. On the contrary, we should see it as a new potential source of raw materials allowing us to at least partially reduce the dependency of the European Union on countries that supply the materials that we are lacking.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, may I start by expressing my satisfaction with the outcome of the debate on the raw materials strategy for Europe and with the high standard of the final report tabled before plenary. I believe that the final text does indeed include the parameters which should govern a dynamic EU raw materials strategy for Europe, in terms of development, industry, the environment and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="el">What we need is a strategy that will strengthen the potential for growth and the competitiveness of the European Union, that will support and be supported by European industry, that will utilise domestic raw materials with absolute respect for the environment, that will be linked to research and innovation efforts, by creating new jobs and providing a high standard of training for human resources, and that will strengthen the position of the European Union in a volatile international environment, in which competition for access to cheap natural resources is expected to become even stiffer.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to comment on the issue of rare earths, which I have repeatedly raised from this tribune. I personally feel justified in persistently raising this issue and repeatedly questioning the European Commission on it. From being a neglected parochial issue of interest to a few specialists, rare earths have become front page news in newspapers and journals. They function as a useful symbol by highlighting the EU’s strategic dependence on raw materials and the need for a decisive, long-term policy in which industrial, research and innovation efforts are supported by clear and balanced international relations.</p>
      <p sl="el">I also feel justified because, according to its recent announcement, the European Commission endorses our proposal to create strategic reserves of rare earths, in order to help bring about price stability and an uninterrupted supply to green and high-tech European industry.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in view of the unequal distribution of the world’s resources, raw materials policy is susceptible to monopolisation. This may bring with it unjustified economic or political demands. It is, therefore, essential for the Union’s raw materials resources to be managed independently by the Member States and for exploitation of these resources to be efficient.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The acquisition of primary raw materials requires an outlay of energy: in other words, it is possible to determine an energy equivalent of raw materials which is a measure of the efficiency of their use. Fiscal stimulation of raw materials production should be the domain of the local authorities responsible for water, land and geological structures. Full application of the subsidiarity principle and better use of public funds make it possible to exploit raw materials efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Union’s policy of strategic partnership with the Russian Federation is becoming an important factor in making up the shortfall of raw materials of many kinds, not just those needed for energy production. Retrieving secondary raw materials by recycling and the substitution of materials are alternatives of enormous potential and require rational expenditure on research and innovation. A growing trend in EU materials engineering is for raw and processed materials which require heavy expenditures of energy for their production to be substituted more extensively by materials which meet criteria related to their use but which require a lower energy outlay. Examples here are the use of wooden structures in individual construction and high fracture toughness advanced ceramics, which can replace metals in the construction of machines.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The pursuit of an ambitious energy and climate policy is impossible without access to raw materials which can be used for the production of other materials with special physical and chemical properties, such as rare earth metals for super magnets, for example, and also copper, which is a good conductor of heat and electricity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bütikofer, for a very good report. Commissioner Tajani, you have given a very clear signal this evening, which gives us hope. After all, we were disappointed with the presentation of the Commission’s strategy in the beginning. However, the raw materials strategy is a vital ingredient for business, employment and jobs here in the European Union. That is why a coherent strategy is essential.</p>
      <p sl="de">It goes without saying that we need the three pillars: security for our sources of raw materials, a recycling strategy, including greater efficiencies, as well as a joint approach so that partnerships can be established with the main raw materials suppliers of this world. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe focus on the idea that we should include more members of the scientific community in this strategy because there are many modern techniques for using raw materials found on the sea bed in the world’s oceans that still need to be researched and developed. This is precisely where Europeans have something to offer raw materials suppliers in developing countries and emerging economies as part of a common raw materials strategy. As liberals we believe it is important to remember that small and medium-sized enterprises require our particular help. Big business can secure raw materials for itself, while small and medium-sized enterprises need a joint strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Hence our call on you: let us work together to unite the Member States under the umbrella of the EU and establish long-term partnerships with the countries with the raw materials. The aim of the raw materials strategy must be to bring economic policy, environmental policy and international trade, together with development policy, under one roof.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we agree that an effective strategy on raw materials is needed. We need to avoid situations like the one in 2007-2008, when a lot of raw materials reached exorbitant prices or were not even available, essentially because of the speculation that affected the raw materials market. We need to create the necessary conditions so that the physical market is not overshadowed by the financial derivatives market, the volume of which has grown disproportionately over the years. However, in order to protect the market from speculation that can make raw materials inaccessible, it is not enough just to talk about transparency in general; we need to go much further.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To begin with, it is necessary to ensure reliable availability of official information on physical flows and stocks of raw materials so that there will be no risk of an interruption in supplies. This again raises the need for better knowledge of the geological resources in Europe and the exploitation of those resources, including in underwater areas, on the seabed. It is also necessary to ensure, however, that those resources are exploited in compliance with social and environmental rules, and that the sovereignty and interests of the states and peoples where those resources are located are respected. That will include the development of cooperation with producer third countries, in particular Africa, thus avoiding any new forms of colonialism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, we also want to emphasise the importance of development and the proper use and recycling of materials, as fully as possible, either because of the scarcity of many primary raw materials, or in order to manage secondary sources, or to reduce negative end-of-life impacts and avoid polluting waste, or to create indigenous industrial opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We hope that the Commission will take account of this range of matters for an effective strategy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, access to raw materials is of crucial importance to the welfare of European citizens and, therefore, the situation on the commodities markets deserves top priority. In this respect, the EU should ensure transparency, stability and a certain degree of market regulation, and it should always consider the question of how far regulation should go.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, we need to properly tap the potential of recycling and of the diversification of sources. Sustainability is the keyword here. European companies have to pursue a responsible purchasing policy, and the European Union must ensure good framework conditions. When EU legislation on conflict minerals is being proposed, everything must be done to prevent the ordinary people affected by mineral extraction from suffering as a result. The demand for raw materials should be met in a fashion that does justice to the countries of origin in terms of human rights, the environment, fair and open trade and market stability. It goes without saying that I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for our rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We are dealing, today, with an extremely important subject – the raw materials which are needed by Europe and the world. At the moment we are talking about an effective strategy which will establish new courses of action both for the consumption and the sustainable use of our resources and raw materials. Natural resources are currently the basis of the operation of all economies, both at world and at European level, and they affect the quality of our lives. Therefore, we must ensure that the model of consumption and production which is accepted today is a standard which can be used, too, by future generations, so that it will not be the case that we simply use resources but leave little to those who come after us. The high consumption of raw materials is also an obstruction to European economies in terms of being competitive, low on emissions and up to date. This is why it is so important to deal with wastes, which contain a large amount of very valuable raw materials. Moving to a green economy will require significant spending, but will also require social and economic changes. It is also essential to ensure integrated action on the development of modern technologies, the power industry, industry in general and environmental protection. Policies and strategies must be focused as soon as possible on limiting emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Therefore it is important that we prepare a strategy which is based on what we have received from our fathers and which passes that legacy on to the generations which come after us.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very important report. Europe, and the world in general, need an effective raw materials strategy, something which has been said here on numerous occasions, to ensure that we have adequate natural resources, and, especially, critical raw materials, now and for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Right at the start, I want to say that I am very pleased that, in this report, the committee has given very close attention to northern Europe, where there are substantial deposits of ores and minerals, and huge areas of forest. Northern Europe, and the Arctic regions in particular, have huge potential and a major role to play in making raw materials available, both now and in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It would be good if the Commission did more to investigate the extent to which we can exploit these European mineral deposits and realised that their sustainable exploitation would reduce the need to import our raw materials from third countries. It needs to be realised that the huge potential that the Arctic regions, in particular, offer in terms of rare earth elements, for example, may in future reduce our dependence on imported minerals.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This report also deals with taxes on minerals, and I am very pleased that the committee has adopted a negative position on the taxation of mineral resources. As stated in the report, in this case tax is not an adequate fiscal tool for increasing resource efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of forests, in particular, as future sources of raw materials and energy. I am rather disappointed that this report does not deal with the matter of forests in any comprehensive way, because forests offer a lot of potential, and the forest sector will also be crucially important in the future green economy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, a lot has already been said about the importance of an effective raw materials strategy for Europe. I would like to move the debate in a more practical direction, so I will concentrate on one particular raw material: phosphate. Phosphate is important for crop growth. However, in 50 to 90 years’ time, world phosphate reserves will be completely exhausted. At around the same time, the world population will increase to 9 billion; these are people who will also want to eat.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, we could just carry on talking about this, but we could also take action, for example by taking steps, here in the European Union, to encourage manure fermentation. That will, first of all, provide us with renewable energy, secondly, reduce the environmental impact and, thirdly, it will yield as an end-product a valuable mineral concentrate, also known as digestate, which can replace artificial fertilisers and, therefore, phosphate. To my mind, that is a win-win-win situation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You could encourage this innovation by backing such projects, for example through the Structural Funds, rural policy or any ‘green’ element of the new common agricultural policy. You could also do this by categorising the mineral concentrate as a substitute fertiliser and not as a primary fertiliser, as is currently the case. This is a technical story, but this example of phosphate shows that an effective raw materials strategy will only stand a chance if words can be translated into concrete actions, technical though they might sometimes be. I hope that the Commissioner is prepared to do something that specific and I look forward to hearing from him whether he will, indeed, take these steps in future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for adopting the amendments tabled in the final draft of the report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union is totally dependent on raw material imports. Indeed, the demand for raw materials will be determined by future developments in the emerging economies and by the rapid spread of the relevant technologies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Transactions involving raw materials and rare earths are carried out worldwide, with the markets for certain raw materials and rare earths being less transparent and generating very low transaction volumes compared with those for other materials. Rare earths are used in the manufacture of monitors, mobile phones and other devices in daily use. They are vital to the manufacture of permanent magnets used in wind turbines, as well as to electric vehicles, car catalytic converters, PCBs, fibre optics and high-temperature superconductors. Therefore, rare earths have a key role to play in the European Union’s economy becoming eco-efficient.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission and Member States to develop, as part of the forthcoming research framework programme, a programme promoting research and innovation in the area of new materials which could replace, in the future, the current raw materials obtained from resources in short supply. At the same time, I should stress the need for investments in the recycling of raw materials and rare earths as the processes for mining, refining and recycling them have severe consequences for the environment if they are not managed properly.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is also important for the European Union to establish fruitful partnerships with countries rich in resources, such as those in North America, Australasia, Asia and the Mercosur region. I urge the European Union to support developing countries which are rich in resources, like India and Brazil. As a member of the EU-Mercosur Delegation, I must mention the Fifth EU-Brazil Summit, which will take place on 4 October in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The availability of raw materials and rare earths is vital to the European Union’s industrial development. This is why we are asking the Commission to ensure that the recommendations made in this report are implemented via concrete actions taken by the Commission and Member States. Finally, we urge the Commission to update the list of raw materials on a regular basis so that we can keep abreast of market and technology developments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Bütikofer, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a very good, well-balanced report. I was very pleased by it. I believe that this report will mean that the Commission will act on the problem of awareness experienced here in Europe. We all know how long we have had to wait for this report. This certainly had nothing to do with Mr Tajani, but rather those around him.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have received information from the last meeting of the Council (environment) indicating that the Commissioner presented the raw materials strategy and that this report received unanimous verbal support. However, there was no sign of such solidarity when it came to item 2 on the agenda, the Electronic Waste Directive, which aimed to define standards and to implement the necessary steps and to set these down in this directive. This was an unmitigated disaster. The Council was unable to reach agreement with the Commission, something that happens relatively rarely, and I am very pleased that Commissioner Potočnik held out against this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore believe that this report can get things moving again in this area. After all, even if the climate problem is only half as serious as we have heard, we still need highly innovative continents like Europe to develop high-tech solutions. This requires the processing of valuable raw materials that we can also sell worldwide. I therefore believe that the three-pillar approach proposed by the Commission cannot be implemented on a successive basis – and here I differ with one or two of my colleagues from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but that we must implement all three together. If some people want to depict raw materials diplomacy in a negative light, it is up to them. My concern is that we should also deal in an upright way with developing countries, something we have failed to do in the last 20 to 30 years. We should forge alliances there so that our export and import opportunities can be expanded, so that we can react in a concerted way, so that we can find a way to behave, so that the regions in which we extract ores also benefit, enabling them to build schools with the profits, for example.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point is an issue that applies within the Community. There are huge opportunities for European industry here, because the issue at stake is the substitution of raw materials such as copper, which we currently take for granted. I am convinced that in the future there will be no more copper water pipes and that the chemicals industry will provide us with new pipes. The potential for industry is enormous.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a farmer myself, I naturally cannot ignore the issue of the Fauna, Flora and Habitats Directive. The FFH Directive is all well and good, but we should not get carried away. The FFH Directive should be seen as an instrument for protecting the environment. My family has been protecting the environment for 300 years without ever needing such directives. However, if the FFH Directive becomes a weapon against raw materials policy, then things will start to get serious and we must make a reasonable response in resisting this together.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third pillar, which has already been mentioned by many people is the question of what we are doing in Europe. Recycling policy and efficiency policy are the golden rule – let us start with this right now.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, this year the European Parliament’s Science and Technology Options Assessment organ (STOA Panel) – on my instigation – has chosen management of natural resources as the theme of its annual lecture. I warmly welcome Mr Bütikofer’s excellent report, because the issue of what will happen to natural resources, including raw materials, is one of the biggest challenges for Europe in the 21st century. The Bütikofer report has got to the crux of the matter, namely that we really need to focus attention on waste recycling. This can be seen not only with regard to raw materials, but also in the case of water. Israel recycles 75%, whereas in Europe the highest rate is in Spain: 25%. I would like to point out, however, that we should have no illusions where waste recycling is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="hu">When the red sludge spill took place in Hungary, it was a disaster. In the aftermath, scientists got together to try to find ways of recycling or reusing the red sludge waste reservoirs. Although the appropriate technology is available, the cost of recycling the sludge was so high that no commercial enterprise was prepared to take on the task. We are on the right track, but we need to give the business sector incentives to play its part too.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, European companies are faced with increasingly intense competition for resources and raw materials. The fierce nature of this competition will continue to grow as we witness, on the one hand, population growth, concentrated in particular in the emerging countries and, on the other hand, economic growth at sustained rates, which will occur in these emerging countries and increase the global demand for resources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, the geographical location of resources in some countries generates and complicates this competition since some countries are inclined to use the resources they own for political ends. This is why it is no coincidence that governments in some countries intervene with industrial policies to support and give an edge to the companies operating in this global competition. We cannot fail to notice that some countries are using public funds to create such advantages.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union cannot stand idly by, and I welcome the course this strategy is taking. Our main efforts must obviously be aimed at decoupling economic growth in European countries from the consumption of resources through innovation and savings. At the same time, we must provide greater support to European companies at EU level by adopting policies which, on the one hand, will encourage strategic alliances, along with private investment in countries rich in resources and, certainly, compliance with fair trade conditions across raw material markets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people have already spoken about the importance of raw materials for the competitiveness and future viability of the European economy. Many speakers have pointed out how much businesses are now dependent on mineral raw materials when it comes to jobs. The latest example that has come to the attention of consumers was the announcement by a small lamp producer that the price of energy-saving bulbs would rise because of difficulties with the supply of rare earths. The price rises were enormous. Accordingly, it is high time that we addressed this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to Mr Bütikofer for coming up with such well-balanced answers. When it comes to the question of achieving results, I believe it is not important that each of us should insist that our opinion is the right one, but rather that everything should be seen in context. That is also why the Commission is correct with its three-pillar approach, which requires us to address the question of tapping new sources of raw materials in Europe too. One of my colleagues has just pointed out that we must also consider technology. Mr Florenz indicated that we would encounter conflicts with other legislation and that we would need to decide where the boundaries lie and how much the various issues mean to us or how we can tap new raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, there is naturally a huge need to tap into greater potential in relation to recycling than is currently the case. There is no doubt about that. However, this is not something to be pursued ‘at any price’, but needs to be considered in a rational and differentiated way.</p>
      <p sl="de">Likewise, the question of international relations is a significant element. Portraying raw materials diplomacy as an instrument of suppression, as one of my colleagues has just done, would indicate a failure to read the text. I believe that international agreements and cooperation are urgently needed so that we in Europe can make greater use of our potential in the distribution of raw materials. Naturally this also means dealing with other countries in an upright fashion. However, I believe that imposing limits on growth or specifications from the Commission on how raw materials are to be used, or more stringent regulations would be the wrong path to choose.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful that we have found a wording in relation to the complicated issue of taxation that we can all agree on. I would ask my colleagues to ensure that this wording is retained, so that we can all support it later on. Broad majority support from Parliament is more important than insisting on having things one’s own way.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Europe is faced with both challenges and opportunities when it comes to raw materials. The challenge needs to be turned into an opportunity which will revitalise Europe’s industrial power. A European industrial innovation strategy is needed, aimed at using Europe’s raw materials efficiently. Making the ways that European industries use raw materials more innovative will contribute significantly to Europe’s competitiveness, sustainability and supply security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Union must develop partnerships with third countries and step up negotiations on raw materials. This can help establish an international regulatory platform which will ensure that the Union is supplied with the necessary raw materials from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission must carry out a study which will identify European industries’ import dependency and the threats to the raw materials supply, and also assess current and future prices. The study will enable industries and research institutions to engage in long-term projects and investments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, with which we can all concur in the broader sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this debate gets really interesting when we speak about specific raw materials. I would like to endorse Mrs de Lange’s comments on the use of phosphorus: how it is in decline and is finite in supply, and how we need to look again at how we will produce food – not just within the European Union but globally – given the circumstances of that single raw material which is crucial to food production.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there are many others. Your report did take on board some of the comments of the Committee on Agriculture, and I thank you for that, but I do think that when it comes to the three-pillar approach it does not mention agriculture and food. It talks specifically about other acquis and industries, and I think that is a mistake. One of the most crucial areas, in my view, for the world and also for the European Union, is food security. We need raw materials to produce food, and many of those that go into food production, into the land, are scarce and in short supply. We need a strategy to ensure that we can continue to have agriculture within the EU.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the rapidly growing global demand for raw materials is fraught with various economic risks, ranging from unpredictable prices to competitiveness. It is therefore necessary to use this opportunity to stress the environmental and economic efficiency of manipulating and exploiting the European raw material base. The entire economic chain should lead towards an efficient use of the raw material base, because no material is here forever. This is why we should emphasise high environmental efficiency such that resources are recycled to be used several times over. I especially want to emphasise the importance of recycling. I therefore support the Commission’s challenge to turn the challenge into an opportunity and to create a long-term European Raw Materials Road Map to 2050.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we all know that a mobile phone, for example, contains familiar metals such as copper and iron, however such devices also contain somewhat less well-known substances, namely the rare earths that are such a vitally important part of future technology. As we know, these are not just rare materials, but also the source of political conflict. In view of the announcement by China, which supplies 97% of high-tech metals, that it intended reducing extraction, the European Union would be well advised to consider stockpiling these materials as part of its raw materials strategy. Plans to support sustainable raw materials extraction in the EU require a sophisticated strategy. Because of the long lead time of five to 10 years, we need to consider now what raw materials requirements we will need to cover in the long term. These deliberations must also take account of the fact that China has secured raw materials sources for itself in Africa, Mongolia or Afghanistan for many years to come.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that recycling will slowly become a more economically interesting prospect in view of the mountains of scrap electronic equipment and rising raw materials prices. However, this should not lead us to choose a radical solution that would cause public outrage – similar to the ban on light bulbs.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, it is good that we are focusing on this subject, because, without any shadow of a doubt, without a sensible strategy in relation to raw materials we cannot do very much. Even if you had the best football manager in the world, he would not win much without the raw material – that is good footballer players. It is the same thing with industries and so forth.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Therefore the rapporteur is to be complimented on a very practical and necessary report, because if Europe is to remain competitive in the world, then it is absolutely vital that we have a constant source of raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Firstly, we must look at the raw materials sources within our own boundaries and certainly not inhibit their development by being over-restrictive. Sometimes I think we have been somewhat restrictive in the past.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Secondly, we obviously want to be environmentally friendly and so forth – everybody agrees with that – but also we can do an awful lot in terms of recycling. Recycling is something that is in many respects in its infancy, and any material that is recycled can of course be used over and over again and this means that less basic raw materials are required.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Thirdly, something which has been mentioned by a number of people, rare earths are absolutely vital. It is said that China controls 97% of rare earths and, as previous speakers pointed out, they are so essential now for so many appliances we use in everyday life that this situation certainly needs to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Therefore we have not much time to waste. We have to be competitive and remain competitive, and this is a strategy to do so. My compliments to the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I still have a couple of comments to make that occurred to me during the course of the debate. I would like to know a little bit more about the difference, which you said you welcomed, between the Commission’s proposal and that of the European Parliament. That is all well and good, but hang on a minute: what specific measures are you are going to take?</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have talked about stockpiling and, to be honest, that does not sound like the right solution to me. I hope that you are not going to go down that route and I would be grateful if you could give us a specific answer on that. The focus has been confined to industrial material only and a lot has already been said about phosphate. I completely endorse what has been said, and that is, indeed, an extremely important issue. However, how are you going to ensure that attention is paid to that, as well as to innovation?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Originally, we had efficiency targets, but now they have been removed altogether. I would, nevertheless, like to see an efficiency target, analogous with the energy targets. We did call for a landfill ban, but that proposal has been watered down in the meantime. However, I would also like to see a target for waste – and that is something that you, too, think is extremely important – so that we remain on top of that waste and are able to process it. We therefore need a landfill ban, so that all that material can be sent straight into the recycling chain.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is the news on the quality mark? Last but not least, the fiscal measures that we have already discussed. Who is going to take the initiative on that? Is the EIB going to play a role? Besides, who is going to coordinate all of that? You, or Mr Potočnik, with his resource efficiency flagship?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I repeat the Commission’s position, which I believe is fully in line with the text presented by Mr Bütikofer: when it comes to the issue of raw materials, we are aiming for a balanced strategy that is based on three pillars, namely the strategy within the European Union, the strategy outside the European Union and the strategy to promote innovation; and I shall begin with the last one, which is, I repeat, a balanced position, a balanced strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Commission, in one of the first documents that it presented on innovation, insisted on the innovation partnership, and the second innovation partnership is the one that specifically concerns the issue of raw materials. It has obtained the Council’s backing, and we intend to build on this decision with the involvement of the European Parliament. The innovation partnership will focus on recycling and substitution, so it is neither a stopgap measure nor a fallback option. Rather, the innovation partnership came before the document on raw materials, and so it is incorrect to say that the European Commission thought about other things before the innovation partnership and recycling measures. I regret that many of the Members who tabled questions are absent at the moment, but our decision to promote recycling and substitution measures was actually taken before the document on raw materials was presented.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the strategy within the European Union, perhaps I spoke too quickly in Italian, and Ms Ulvskog was unable to hear what I said about Sweden: I said that Greenland will be one of the places that we visit so that we can carry out work to see what can be done in relation to raw materials; I said that I took part in and co-convened with the Swedish Government a meeting held in the European Parliament and presided over by the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which initiatives concerning raw materials in the Barents Sea were discussed. I have already arranged a visit to Sweden with the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs so that I can go and see what can be done in relation to raw materials in the area concerned. I repeat – since the interpretation may not have been accurate when I spoke in Italian, and I therefore wanted to reassure Ms Ulvskog – that I have not forgotten about Sweden. However, Greenland was part of Denmark until fairly recently, and today there is a union with the Kingdom of Greenland. I therefore think that Greenland is not all that far removed from our Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to international policy, I wish to reassure you – and I regret that Ms Matias and Ms Figueiredo are not in the Chamber at present – that I have no intention of pursuing neocolonial policies in Africa. I come from a country that was the first to apologise to Africa for the mistakes made and the atrocities committed during the colonial era; I do not think that Europe should have a colonial policy in that continent. Rather, my work in relation to raw materials agreements sees the countries of Africa becoming involved and playing a strong role: all this work has been examined in meetings with the African Union in close cooperation with many countries of the African Union, precisely because Africa must not be regarded as a victim of neocolonialism. Moreover, I do not believe that Europe’s aim today is neocolonialism.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to an issue that was raised by Ms Schnieber-Jastram and Mr Lange when tabling their question, and subsequently highlighted by Ms Ek, I should like to say that the Commission is seriously committed to supporting the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is an emerging international standard designed to ensure transparent revenues and accountability within the sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have recently increased our support for this initiative by contributing to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund and cofinancing an expert group, supporting national projects and participating more in the Council. However, the initiative still has its shortcomings, starting with the fact that, of the more than 50 hydrocarbon- and mineral resource-rich countries that are covered by the Trust Fund, only nine have so far complied with the provisions of the EITI.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the presentation of a formal proposal on a country reporting requirement following the discussion with the EU Member States and Parliament, the Commission is exploring the possibility of introducing a country-by-country financial reporting requirement for publicly traded companies in the EU, and, depending on the outcome of the assessment being carried out, we may be able to table a legislative proposal on the subject in autumn. The proposal will supplement and enhance the EITI and will be implemented in the same spirit as the US Dodd-Frank Act, to which Mr Bütikofer referred. Public consultation on the issue took place from October 2010 to 2011, and the results are currently being assessed.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the last issue, stockpiling, we believe that the responsibility for guaranteeing raw material supplies essentially lies with companies and that the role of political and institutional authorities is to ensure the most suitable working conditions. However, the Commission is willing to discuss, in close cooperation with the Member States, the benefits of a raw materials stockpiling programme, the practical ways in which to implement it and the added value of such a programme, which could, moreover, take inspiration from the existing oil reserve programme. This possibility has begun to be examined in a pilot survey, which is still under way.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have not responded to all of the issues raised during the debate but I am due to speak for another half an hour, and I think that it is important to listen to Mr Bütikofer instead. However, I remain at the disposal of all the MEPs to address any individual issues relating to the EU raw materials strategy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank everybody for their contributions. I would also thank the Vice-President of the Commission Mr Tajani for his comments and, in particular, for his support for the establishment of a competency network for rare earths and the other practical suggestions he has made; thank you Mr Tajani.</p>
      <p sl="de">A lot has rightly been said about the extraction of raw materials on the domestic front. I believe there is a lot of work to do in this area. However, we must also take a sensitive approach to ecologically sensitive areas. As the report also states, it is important that we should not falsely cast industrial policy and conservation as two opposing movements. That is why I was pleased that the Directorate-General for the Environment and the Directorate-General for Enterprise were able to reach an agreement. Urban mining is important. We could say that our mines also include the old laptops and mobile phones we all have languishing in the back of a cupboard somewhere. The fact is, we have to make recycling an economic solution. My reason for saying this is that last week I attended the opening of the world’s most modern recycling plant for lithium batteries. This is also something that must become an economic solution. Cradle to cradle is a wonderful prospect. We need to make waste an old-fashioned word.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need further discussions on stockpiling. I hear different opinions coming from the Commission. I know, for example, that Mr De Gucht takes a very critical view of this issue. I am not yet convinced about how we can manage the stockpiling of rare earths, for example, when China is continuing to reduce production. We can discuss this, however. I would like to state expressly to Ms Girling, who is no longer in the Chamber: we need to proceed with circumspection in all of these questions and impact assessments are required.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, another word on external affairs: I do not see raw materials policy as neocolonialism. Otherwise the Commission and Parliament would never have recognised the principle of the sovereignty of raw materials. For me it is important that no time should be lost. We need to cooperate with the US and Japan. However we must also recognise, for example, that Japan is currently investing heavily in research aimed at developing substitution strategies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The scarcity of resources has exacerbated the international situation, and has culminated in a scramble for resources and widening divisions between countries with resources and those without. No one has benefited from this. It is therefore necessary to develop new approaches for dealing with the issue of raw materials (RM) – especially those which are most critical – in an innovative and innovation-promoting manner, with a view to ultimately avoiding zero-sum games. We must develop a coherent and focused strategy with priority actions for RM: an industrial innovation strategy to secure RM and our competitiveness. Any strategy on RM will ultimately have to focus on increasing innovation in how European industries use RM as this will make a significant contribution to our competitiveness, sustainability and the security of supply. The RM challenge must be turned into an opportunity to invigorate Europe’s industrial power by tapping our innovation and R&amp;D potential. Besides an industrial innovation strategy that aims to lower resource consumption and increase recycling in addition to the sustainable domestic potential that the EU holds, the European Union will, naturally, have to continue to rely on external suppliers for its RM.</p>

      <p sl="ro">European industry is faced with a delicate situation in terms of its raw materials supply. We currently depend to a large extent on imports, especially for rare earths. These resources are of paramount importance to the EU’s transition towards a sustainable, low-carbon economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the proposal to establish a European raw materials working group that encompasses all the relevant Directorate-Generals may have a positive impact and is an effective measure. This working group should develop priority actions for managing the key elements and ensure strategic cohesion. At the same time, I believe that particular attention must be focused on recovering useful materials from urban waste.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The challenge that we are currently facing must be turned into an opportunity to revitalise Europe’s industrial power by leveraging our research, development and innovation potential. We must keep ourselves at the forefront of the global competitive environment and adopt an industrial innovation strategy which will allow us to streamline the use of resources and recycling processes. Last but not least, we must ensure that the European Union develops lasting, mutually beneficial partnerships with countries rich in resources, as well as strategies based on them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Faced with the continued volatility of prices and the risk of possible raw material shortages, it is important for the European Union to propose a strong and effective strategy that will guarantee the more sustainable use and the improved supply of these precious natural resources. I believe that in a climate of great economic uncertainty around the world, it is necessary to deliver an industrial policy for European businesses that recognises the vital importance of having access to raw materials. Too often, in fact, Europe falls victim to financial speculation by exporting countries that have a monopoly over resources that are crucial to the aerospace, automotive, chemical and construction industries, for example, and therefore cause their prices to become extremely unstable. Some estimates show that demand in the EU for a number of essential raw materials could actually treble by 2030, thus compounding the current situation. We must therefore act fast, strengthen our trade strategy and propose concrete, achievable measures, such as the reintroduction of extraction activities in the EU and recycling. In this connection, I must stress that waste electrical and electronic equipment often conceals a real treasure trove of metals that ought to be made accessible through recycling.</p>

      <p sl="en">Raw materials policy is a vital part of the EU’s industrial policy, ensuring competitiveness of European companies, sustainability of raw materials’ use and security of supply. The Commission had included biotic resources in its communication and thus the raw materials strategy contributes to facing the challenges of Europe, and can be anchored into the other EU policies to tackle them. This report, focusing only on minerals, takes a narrow and short-term approach to tackling the availability of specific raw materials and particularly rare earths. It fails to fulfil the task given and some measures are disproportionate. Article 15 calls for a study on the effects of a tax on water and land use, which would hurt our sustainable forest industries. This would make wood-based products more expensive than metals and minerals, and at times when substituting high-carbon products with low-carbon wood products forms a partial answer in the fight against climate change. I hope the Commission, while taking up proposals from the report, keeps its broad approach including biotic resources (e.g. wood), pushes for the Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, with all raw materials addressed, and recognises the positive contribution to meeting the challenges of forests, forestry and forest-based industries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Today, Europe is certainly facing the challenge of an unprecedented shortage of critical and key raw materials to sustain its technological innovation and production in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is very much due to the very high level of reliance on external supplies, coupled with the recent restrictions on Chinese exports. Indeed, the European Commission estimates that the EU is 97% dependent on rare earth supplies from China, and China on its own produces some 90% of these valuable materials.</p>
      <p sl="en">This tendency is likely to continue with the EU’s shift to a low-carbon economy, with renewable technologies requiring more raw materials, and especially rare earths, inputs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, as to Europe's supply of raw materials, most certainly the resources exist and the dependency on external supply can be reduced.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question is, how can the EU secure a stable supply for our industry, and at what cost? The report that we have prepared offers some elements of a reply. Certainly, today the EU needs a complex, multidimensional common strategy, combining internal and external dimensions, for the supply in raw materials.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The availability of non-energy and non-agricultural raw materials is a key prerequisite for transition to a sustainable economy. At present, for example, China controls 97% of global production of rare earth minerals, and since 2005 has been systematically reducing its exports as growing global demand has pushed up prices. China is probably planning to halt the export of certain strategic raw materials as soon as 2015. It is therefore clear that the strategy on effective use of raw materials will determine the competitiveness of European industry. We must aim above all for the reuse and recycling of material currently available. For example, obtaining aluminium through recycling is 95% cheaper than producing it from virgin material. Millions of tonnes of potentially usable material is lying in European landfills. An effective waste policy is not just an environmental symbol, but above all a fundamental prerequisite for securing independence in terms of raw materials. It is now impossible to guarantee that development policy will not become a diplomatic tool for obtaining raw materials from developing countries that have extensive reserves. So-called raw materials diplomacy threatens to lead to a hidden neocolonialism which sees countries with extensive reserves as mere exporters of raw materials. Europe has been caught napping and we must adopt measures as quickly as possible to ensure sufficient strategic raw materials for information technology and renewable energy facilities and other key sectors. This is no longer just an environmental problem; it is also about the economic freedom of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, on 29 June this year the Majorcan pilot Antonio Planas, who was 49 years old, lost his life, the victim of a Taliban terrorist attack, along with 20 other people in Kabul. Antonio was married and he was the father of an eight-year-old girl. He worked for a Turkish airline and his death took place outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am using this minute to point out that all those Europeans who are the victims of a terrorist attack outside the EU do not qualify for the forms of compensation that they would qualify for if the attack had taken place within a Member State. Imagine the position of Antonio’s daughter and his widow: they are victims of terrorism but they cannot enjoy the same rights as if the attack had taken place in Spain.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, I would like to seek protection for all those Europeans who are the victims of terrorism when the death takes place outside the territory of the EU. In Spain a law is being formulated, the law for the recognition and comprehensive protection of victims of terrorism, which appears to be capable of correcting that grave error and of rehabilitating and protecting all victims of terrorism equally, in favour of memory, dignity, justice and truth, which are doubtless the ideas that underlie the law itself.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I am referring to the unprecedented situation in my county of Teleorman where the prefect is abusing his administrative power to block the activities of the local authorities, in spite of a number of legal judgments already issued in the relevant cases.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One serious example of this is the repeated attacks in court against the decisions approving the budgets for the County Council and in 34 locations, even though the prefect is not granted by law the powers to verify the suitability of administrative acts, but only their legality. The direct result of this is that any local funding is being suspended until the court issues its judgment. Several European projects are also at risk of being permanently compromised due to the accumulation of penalties and missed execution deadlines.</p>

Oil and gas workers in Kazakhstan have been on strike for many months. Some are on hunger strike, their demonstrations are broken up, strikers are arrested and pressure is being put on their families. Natalia Sokolova, a lawyer acting for the strikers’ trade union, has been arrested and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. Trade union activist Akzhanat Aminov has also been sentenced. However, yet worse things are going on there: people associated with the trade union movement have been murdered. Trade union activist Zhaksylyk Turbaev has been killed.

How can we justify such an arrest, when it has been followed by a trial and a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union stipulating that Italy may not arrest an illegal immigrant because illegal immigration is not a crime in itself? Why is the Court of Justice of the European Union intervening in support of illegal immigrants by overturning an Italian law but not intervening by overturning a Swedish law providing for the arrest of an Italian father who committed the crime of smacking his son in public?

Meanwhile, in Romania there is political pressure to force through a mining project that smacks of corruption and risks bringing about an environmental and natural catastrophe.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission has recently replied to my written question, confirming that Commissioners Almunia and Kroes attended the Bilderberg meeting in St Moritz in June.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission cannot give me details of what was discussed, but assures me that the Bilderberg meetings do not take decisions.</p>

      <p sl="en">And what other summit of world leaders in politics, finance and business would go completely unreported in the mainstream media, such as the BBC? It is impossible not to reach the conclusion that the non-reporting of these events is anything other than a conspiracy between the organisers and the media.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it has been well demonstrated that the whole idea of the euro zone – a single currency value for 17 very different economies – is flawed economically. Its purpose, of course, has been to facilitate political integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the euro zone shows signs of unravelling, the logical remedy would be to unravel it completely. However, the chosen remedy is not less Europe, but more Europe. The German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has said that a new constitutional treaty is required. This has been described by Herman Van Rompuy as the establishment of a United States of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The British Conservative leader fantasises about having some sovereignty returned to the United Kingdom as the price for agreeing to federalism being foisted on the euro zone. Such a deal would not only be immoral, it would also be self-defeating in the long term.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, every year September marks the start of another school year. The European Union’s global competitiveness is primarily based on the quality of its human resources. Indeed, the Union is acknowledged as a centre of excellence in the field of education.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States are faced with the impact of the economic and financial crisis. Some Member States, which are in the process of fiscal consolidation, have reduced their education budgets. Regrettably, many schools have been closed in Romania over the last two years, especially in rural areas, with the loss of thousands of teaching jobs. The main effect of these measures is to increase the school dropout rate, particularly in rural areas, thereby jeopardising the future of subsequent generations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The future of Member States and the Union’s competitiveness depend on the quality of and, above all, universal access to education. Education is a right and must not become a luxury. This is why I call on the Commission to ensure that access to education is guaranteed in every Member State and that investment in education becomes a priority.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In addition to this, there are also legislative measures and proposals that are contributing to this financial meltdown, particularly for small wine producers. That is why the Douro designated wine region, which was first established more than 250 years ago and is where the famous port wine is produced, is experiencing a time of anxiety and indignation, as has already been revealed during the two protests that recently took place there. The same thing is happening in other regions; farmers were protesting just last week in Palmela.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, in Europe, citizens of European Union Member States have enjoyed additional Community rights since the Treaty of Maastricht. It was all the more of a shock, therefore, when Slovakia passed legislation last year under which individuals who become citizens of another country, including another EU Member State, will forfeit their Slovak citizenship. No attempt has been made to hide the fact that this legislation is directed primarily against Slovakia’s Hungarian community, to put an obstacle in the way of their adopting Hungarian citizenship, which is legally possible. Political forces driven by nationalist sentiment are ignoring the fact that in the EU this is in breach of Community law and stands in the way of ensuring mobility within Europe. Alongside the rights afforded by EU citizenship, it seems quite natural to express one’s relationship with another Member State by way of citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In addition to a purely legal relationship, moral motives are often another important factor. At an emotional level, an EU citizen who belongs to a minority may wish to be connected to two Member States at once if he believes this is the best way to ensure the preservation of his identity. In my view, the EU cannot simply stand by and watch European integration being distorted in this manner.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, 20.7% of young people in the European Union are unemployed. The numbers are even more disappointing in countries such as Spain, where the unemployment rate among young age groups is close to 46.2%, and in Greece, where the figure is 38.5%. In what is admittedly an unprecedented economic situation, Europe needs a common strategy to reverse unemployment among young people, perhaps even a new pan-European employment pact. There are good examples of useful practices applied both in individual Member States and in third countries. There are the examples of Austria and the Netherlands and there is also the USD 400 billion anti-unemployment campaign currently being run by the Obama administration in the United States.</p>

The removal by the authorities of bilingual street and place names in regions where a minority accounts for a clear majority of the local population in this particular case concerns Poles, and the imposition of fines on these people is a blatant example of this discrimination.

It is a challenge for all of us, so that we may summon up the courage to take significant steps towards European integration. Let us not be intimidated by assertions of a superstate or diktats from Brussels. Close EU integration is the response to the Europe-wide war that lasted throughout the first half of the 20th century. The Balkan wars of the 1990s showed us where Europe might be without the EU. The Lisbon Treaty is an important step forward. The dynamics of world politics and economic globalisation are so rapid that they place new demands on the EU. Our citizens expect us to lend the world rational initiatives, stable economic development and support for democracy and liberation movements. The European Union must be equipped with all the tools of executive power, and must be able to act flexibly and effectively.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to raise a case that has been brought to my attention: that of an Irish citizen detained in Sri Lanka, a Mr Jayasundaram. He was arrested there in September 2007 and, although no warrant was issued or charges brought against him, he was accused of providing support to the militant liberalisation group LTTE. It is a matter of grave concern that no evidence of this charge was ever provided. He has been moved from prison to prison and has suffered from several medical complaints throughout his detention.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I had actually prepared a rather different intervention for today, but things seem to be developing very rapidly.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I think it is regrettable that we are not having a full debate. This is a very important topic. I think this is underlined by the controversy about the report, and therefore I think it would have merited the presence of the responsible Commissioner, the Council and many colleagues, including the shadows.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am rather unpleasantly surprised by the extreme reluctance – both within the European Parliament and the European Commission – to evaluate the EU counter-terrorism policies. As a Democrat, I think evaluation is an essential part of democracy. It is about transparency, accountability to our citizens and making our policies better and more efficient. I think that a democracy that is unable and unwilling to take a critical look at its own policies is not worth the term ‘democracy’. If we are convinced that we have got it right in our policies, I think we can be confident that they will stand the test.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do not only have a duty to our own citizens, we also have to be a moral compass in the world. Frankly, colleagues, I feel that if we are unable to carry out a thorough evaluation of the measures we have taken over the last ten years, we lose all credibility and moral authority, and that is particularly important at the time of the Arab Spring. How can we look the young people in North Africa in the eye and say to them – with credibility – you have to create democracy and the rule of law, respect human rights and live by the principles of accountability and transparency, if we do not live up to that and are unwilling to do it ourselves?</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say that there is a great deal of controversy around this report; I think this is very regrettable and disappointing. I did expect a controversial debate, but I did not expect it to be quite this acrimonious. We voted in July, but ever since the vote, several Members and Groups have changed their positions, in some cases by 180 degrees. Texts that were agreed unanimously are now being put forward for deletion by several Groups. I find that surprising.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now let us have a look at the texts that are so incredibly shocking and radical that they have to be taken out. First there is a paragraph – paragraph 26 – that was agreed unanimously (I underline unanimously) by all the political groups, referring to Article 70 of the Treaty – very shocking, very radical – calling for an evaluation on the basis of that same Treaty. There is, for example, a paragraph saying that we should not only address the consequences of terrorism but also the causes; very radical. There is a paragraph calling for impact assessments and proportionality tests; very radical – except it is already compulsory. There is another paragraph referring to proper access to documents: that is the official position of this House!</p>
      <p sl="en">So I have to say I am very surprised by some of the requests for separate votes. However, I do think that in this case – and I will conclude on that, Chair – it is much more important that we achieve a result. I will try until the very last moment to bring people together and see if we can arrive at some sort of agreement, because we owe it not to this House, but to our citizens and to the rest of the world.</p>

It is the responsibility of the specialised agencies such as Europol and Eurojust but it is also the responsibility of the European Parliament, which is certainly committed to transparency, to political scrutiny and, accordingly, to the evaluation of policies on matters of security which the Treaty of Lisbon entrusts now, from this point in time and into the future, to the EU and also to Parliament. However, the latter also has a commitment to security: it must not only watch over the right to freedom but also over the right to security, and it must issue a message of solidarity with the victims of terrorism, with the countries that fight against terrorism in Europe …</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you, Ms in’t Veld, for your work. We need specific assistance for victims. We have to know what we spend on fighting terrorism, what impact that work has on everyone’s freedoms and how much it costs in human, social, economic and political terms. We owe that transparency to the citizens of Europe if we want to generate trust and consensus.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my country, terrorism has killed almost 900 people and that is an unjustifiable cost in lives, in sorrow. Some thought, moreover, that they were killing in our name and we lived under guard while they accused us of collaborating with ETA. Political prejudices prevented the Basque police from participating in Schengen and that has cost lives. They even closed down a newspaper unjustly and our Parliament has lost legitimacy because some rulings facilitated absolute majorities to those who did not have them at the ballot boxes.</p>
      <p sl="es">Separatism and the defence of the right to self-determination are legitimate ideas. What is dangerous is ETA, which fortunately is coming to an end. It is an expression of violent extremism like others; in order to repress it they must be arrested but in addition we must strengthen democracy with debate, transparency and more respect for the people.</p>

I am a little surprised that some groups want to revisit the issue here. I am also surprised by the reaction of Mr Díaz de Mera.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe it is absolutely essential that we should assess the EU’s anti-terrorism policy, mainly in order to ensure better terrorism-related policies. This means that someone like me, who is absolutely in favour of the surveillance of terrorists and the prevention of terrorist attacks, must support the effective assessment of the 10 years of effort that we have invested, both in relation to the establishment of priorities and the associated costs, and in terms of the extent of the interventions, for example relating to civil rights and the norms of the rule of law, and on the other hand, that we should evaluate the measures that we have implemented. I believe that this is important to our citizens and to this Parliament and that it would be right to do it now. In my opinion it would be highly dangerous to retreat back to camp at this stage.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, by way of introduction I consider it necessary to confirm the finding in paragraph 12 of the report that in the European Union the threat of terrorism is multi-faceted and that many of the dangers also stemming from separatist sentiments are initiated by separatist movements. In the future strategy for EU internal security we must therefore distinguish between international, religiously motivated terrorism and territorial, secessionist-oriented terrorism with several hotspots also within the European Union. Through better coordination between national policies in the fight against terrorism and the policies of the Union we must achieve a level whereby measures and instruments in the fight against terrorism are not unnecessarily duplicated, whilst ensuring that no potential gaps may remain in the system. Given that terrorism is a dynamically evolving phenomenon, the European policy on combating terrorism must be creative so as to eliminate all the threats.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the British-Austrian philosopher Karl Popper once said: ‘We must plan for freedom, and not only for security, if for no other reason than only freedom can make security more secure.’ I believe that the European Union and its Member States are guided by a contrary principle and are gradually transforming the liberal rule of law into a preventionist regime. For example, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research is to spend a total of EUR 1.4 billion in the field of security. Only two of the approximately 120 projects deal with data protection or legal and social issues. That is precisely why it is important to question the fundamental rights critically, as Ms in’t Veld has done, and to include data protection in the report, also embracing those aspects relating to privacy. It is also important to evaluate the last 10 years. That is why I naturally intend supporting the report and will be canvassing for further support over the next few hours.</p>

It is a disappointing outcome. This report does not represent us, it does not represent hopes for justice, or the balance between freedom and security that we talk about so much here.

Despite the fact that the Member States have different experiences of terrorism and that the levels of threat are different, we must work together to prevent the terrorists exploiting the differences within the EU in terms of legislation, capacity to combat terrorism and the abolition of border controls.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I welcome the debate on this report, which marks 10 years since the attacks that changed counter-terrorism policy globally. In the amendments which we tabled, we supported international cooperation on fighting terrorism, however, with respect for human rights. The new European External Action Service plays a key role in this process. Coordination with the Council’s structures and European agencies ensures a single response to the current security challenges.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With regard to the other international organisations, the relevant UN treaties serve as a legal benchmark. I should mention Article 23.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the counter-terrorism policy is coming alarmingly to the fore, bringing with it the increasing need to set clear rules for its application, especially, as the rapporteur stated, with respect for fundamental rights and data protection of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In particular I would like to highlight the need for strengthened judicial and police cooperation within the European Union as an essential and necessary instrument to secure all the attributes of democracy. In my opinion such cooperation should, however, be supervised by the European Parliament and national parliaments, particularly in terms of transparency and access to documents, and also to the entire European counter-terrorism policy. I therefore propose that there should be a strengthening of judicial cooperation, particularly in the field of investigation and prosecution with the possibility of freezing assets, protecting witnesses and the victims of such crimes, and setting the rate of compensation for victims of terrorism and the like. I therefore appeal to all EU institutions to apply the Charter in their work and adhere to the fundamental rights and freedoms associated with such a sensitive area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I wish to thank, on behalf of my colleague Cecilia Malmström, whom I am representing here this evening, the rapporteur and the other Members of this House for their help in drafting this report. The report undoubtedly makes a valuable contribution to the debate on counter-terrorism policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following on from the Commission’s summary communication of July 2010, we now have reports providing for a very ambitious programme to increase the level of knowledge of the counter-terrorism efforts being made in Europe. The Commission supports the measures aimed at improving evaluations and hence policy-making. There is no doubt that imposing heavy economic burdens or unnecessarily restricting fundamental rights and civil liberties would only benefit those whom we are trying to counter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only measured policies can be legitimate, credible and properly understood. They should be supervised, evaluated and applied constantly. However, a simple economic approach, based on a cost-benefit analysis, is not sufficient to appreciate the complex nature of security issues, which are a main concern of our citizens and a key factor in the welfare of our societies. Furthermore, a number of the proposed measures could prove unenforceable, since the scope of some of them has not been clearly defined. It therefore seems unrealistic, in the short term, to envisage an in-depth and detailed 10-year evaluation of counter-terrorism policy in the European Union, not least because of the multitude of actual counter-terrorism policies and measures, or policies and measures relating to it. What is more, the Commission does not have sufficient resources to accomplish such a task at present.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Besides, by taking stock of all the counter-terrorism policies conducted by the Member States, we should be able to see things more clearly. The EU’s counter-terrorism coordinators could play an important role in this regard by contributing to this inventory and carrying out coordination work thanks to this close relationship with the Member States’ administrations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Upon reading Ms in ’t Veld’s report, I was surprised at the naivety of some of its statements and proposals. It is clear that Ms in ’t Veld is no expert in terrorism, or even in counter-terrorism as it is carried out in the Member States. She also has a short memory! An opponent of profiling, she does, however, suggest that some forms of terrorism, which she describes as ‘religiously motivated’, are the work of poorly integrated and disadvantaged minorities. The fact is, most of the perpetrators of the terrorist acts of the last decade were fully integrated, had a university degree, a job and citizenship of an EU country. An advocate of absolute transparency, of cost-benefit analysis and of democratic debate on the policy being pursued, she prefers to ruin all the efforts of the police and intelligence services, the success of which depends precisely on discretion. Her proposals amount to nothing less than informing potential terrorists of our weaknesses and of the best possible targets to aim for. Had I needed any proof that counter-terrorism is one area that must be protected as much as possible from the harmful actions of the EU and its institutions, Ms in ’t Veld’s report would have certainly provided it.</p>

      <p sl="en">During the year-long preparations the EPP Group presented a unanimously firm position by expressing its discontent over the tone and subject matter of the report. I had a negative opinion about the report. Reservations were twofold: a matter of both principle and the practical approach. I was critical of the tone determined by prejudices, an assumption that counter-terrorism keeps violating human rights, operates with excessive budgets and exaggerates threats. These propagandistic assumptions were based on hypotheses for which no evidence was provided by the rapporteur. The goals laid down in the report are hardly feasible in practice but the rapporteur showed no intention of reflecting on this. As data is classified for security reasons, to what extent and on which benchmarks should the proportionality between the cost of a preventive counter-terrorism operation and the threat level be assessed? As supporters of transparency and accountability, the EPP Group stands for overseeing counter-terrorism policies; however, within the established competence of designated authorities, not bodies made up of ambitious civilians or self-declared politicians. Undermining the morale of counter-terrorism, especially nowadays, is proof of irresponsible behaviour, thus the EPP is not in a position to support a report reflecting any political campaign jeopardising security.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Ten years on from the attacks carried out on 11 September 2001, terrorist threats continue to pose serious problems for the European Union and its citizens, with 249 attacks recorded in 2010 on European soil alone. The European Commission must consider increasing the funding for counter-terrorism assistance measures in the future Instrument for Stability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The statements made this year in the European Parliament by the Director of Europol indicate that terrorist groups are becoming increasingly diverse and versatile in the way they operate, with proof available showing an increase in international cooperation between groups. This is precisely the reason why existing counter-terrorism-related strategic partnerships need to be expanded and strengthened, and other new ones established with countries outside Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Russians and Americans sowed the seeds for terrorists like Bin Laden during the Cold War. Bin Laden may now be history, however his legacy remains in a radicalisation of the way in which terrorism is combated. The principles of the rule of law were the first to fall victim to the ‘war on terrorism’. Even within the EU, human rights violations take place and are hushed up in the name of ‘combating terrorism’. The US has often been more concerned with enhancing its leadership role than with cutting off terrorism at its roots. These are national, ethnic and religious conflicts. Now people find themselves under the investigators’ spotlight before they have committed a crime, so that, for example, innocent airline passengers are required to reveal all their personal data. Remember that we have no evidence for the success of these investigations involving a kind of data striptease. Now, following the killings in Norway, there is a suggestion that we should establish our own network for the ‘early detection of possible perpetrators of violent crime’. This is grotesque. Are we to have a situation in which anyone who has ever entertained ‘radical thoughts’, or anyone who fails the political correctness test, is to be monitored as a potential terrorist? Such a development is to be rejected in the strongest terms. In addition, clear separation is essential between members of the police and secret service when it comes to appointments to security bodies. Finally, a thorough review is also required of the role of EU Member States in CIA operations.</p>

      <p sl="et">This report offers a good analysis of the present policy and shortcomings of the EU’s anti-terrorism struggle. I concur that the struggle against terrorism needs a united approach, regardless of the fact that the situation may seem very different from one Member State to another. It is enough for one EU Member State to underestimate the terror threat, and the consequences may be catastrophic. The struggle against terrorism does not, of course, mean that we deal only with consequences; we must invest more in policies countering racism and discrimination. Society must certainly be heedful that the fundamental rights of the members of our civil society not be violated under the banner of the struggle against terrorism. I also perceive a danger in the behaviour of several superpowers, which too lightly label ‘unpleasant persons’ terrorists because they dare to stand up for the human rights of small nations and do not approve of all of the decisions made by the central authorities. Naturally the concept of terrorism and the terrorist should be precisely defined at the European level, to ensure that individual human rights activists who are politically at odds with the authorities are not groundlessly labelled as terrorists or accused of terrorism, as was unfortunately customary in the former Soviet Union.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, confidence is what the European companies and economy needs. Audit companies are currently weighed down by a concentration and lack of independence of auditors, and they do not help to generate the much-desired confidence to get our economy going again.</p>
      <p sl="es">A proposal for eliminating the legal obligation for account auditing cannot be ruled out. Why not? If we want to recover the confidence of the markets and market stability, we must carry out a deep reform of the audits, so that they provide genuine added value, and not merely a legal burden.</p>
      <p sl="es">The big auditing firms use auditing services as a business card for their future customers. Once familiar with the company, they offer more burdensome additional services through which they often compensate for the low prices of auditing itself.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have a price distortion problem within the sector. These additional services already comprise almost 50% of turnover, which is why the big auditing firms do not wish to lose the auditing services, not for the auditing itself, but rather to maintain and increase the additional services.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second major obstacle to free competition in the sector is the oligopoly comprised of the four big firms that account for over 90% of the European market. As an oligopoly, they control prices and place barriers against new competition, using intangible ideas such as the brand’s international image.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that this brand image can provide advantages, but it does not always mean greater efficiency, given the legislative diversity in terms of accounting statements liable to be processed in a special way in each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="es">I share the aims of the Green Paper, in terms of the independence and deconcentration of the sector, and the means to be used: rotation, group audits, tendering, fortifying professional scepticism, prevalence of substance over form, and the separation of auditing services from non-auditing services. I have tried to apply them to my report within what is permitted by the parliamentary majorities and the report’s modest reach.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, this is nothing more than a small step towards achieving new legislation that rights the wrongs in the audit sector, which have led us to this terrible economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, it is indeed a paradox that throughout the debate on the crisis and the anti-crisis measures the scale of the accountability of the banks and the extent of the non-transparency, which increases systemic risk, have been absent.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the period before the crisis the banks were awarded outstanding certificates from their auditors and all of a sudden we hear that many of them have so many worthless assets on their books, that they are at risk of collapse even on small fluctuations. We must consider that fact seriously and we must effectively ensure that such a situation does not re-occur in the future. One of the reasons for the inconsistency of audit reviews and their poor quality is mainly the concentration of large firms in this type of business. Four large companies depend on revenue from the rated financial institutions, and they therefore gave them good ratings regardless of the actual situation. I therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal that this monopoly should be broken up and that real competition should be introduced in the audit market so that smaller companies might get a chance. I would therefore ask the Commission, namely the Directorate-General for Competition, to hold a detailed review of the audit market and to develop a pan-European system of professional liability for auditors.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, numerous banks posted losses both on and off the balance sheet between 2007 and 2009, while still receiving a clean bill of health from the auditors. Auditors are appointed and paid by the audited companies themselves, something that naturally diminishes their independence. On top of this, liability privileges also apply in many European countries. Consequently, I would like to start by making it clear that the Commission has taken a step in the right direction with its Green Paper. This is absolutely essential if we are not just to address the issue of credit rating agencies that are worthy of criticism, but also the role of those auditors who have failed to perform their duties correctly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention one more aspect that I consider to be particularly important, namely external rotation. Again and again we are made aware of how important it is that courtesy audits should not be allowed to take place. This also requires external rotation at regular intervals.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the economic crisis into which we have been driven precisely by the audit system, or in which the audit system has played such a key role, it is symptomatic that this oligopoly of the four credit rating agencies has still not been seriously targeted with legislation by the European institutions. I should therefore like to congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo for having addressed the matter in his report and for having attempted to push forward this issue, which is certainly not taboo. Spending a lifetime waiting for these firms to suddenly meet ethical standards out of the blue that they decide to follow alone is not an option; nor is it a future for our economies or for the credibility of our banking systems or the European markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We can only hope that a public supervisory body will assess the credibility of these audit agencies. However, I believe that even more needs to be done: the audit system itself needs to be pluralistic; the audit firms must not all be stimulated and motivated in the same way, as they are essentially being paid by their customers and speculators; and furthermore they must not be replaced by a mere public system that has little credibility itself. They must be tempered with real pluralism, which emerges, for example, from the academic and university system, from statistical institutes and from European audit agencies, and all of these audit centres must be regulated in order to create a real pluralistic and credible audit system.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to support the various proposals contained in the report by Mr Masip Hidalgo. In particular, the adoption of international auditing standards by the European Commission would allow us to harmonise audits at a European level, which would certainly simplify the work of supervisory bodies. When audits of financial institutions are conducted the reports should also include enhanced disclosure requirements for the valuation of less liquid assets. The auditors should also have an obligation to notify the supervisory authorities of any problems found which may jeopardise the continuation of the activities of an entity being audited. Division of the audit market may also help improve the competitive environment and improve the quality of audit work. I firmly believe that through continual improvement and an increase in the quality of the work of auditors we can also improve correct valuation and property management, and it is therefore good that the European Parliament has addressed this issue once again.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I remember very clearly what I said during my hearing before the European Parliament in January 2010. On that occasion, Ms Flašíková Beňová, I gave an undertaking, in accordance with the G20 road map and with the commitment made by the Heads of State or Government of the European Union, that no sector, product or financial market would escape from intelligent regulation and effective supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since then, Ms Flašíková Beňová, I and all of my teams have been busy drafting legislative texts aimed at establishing – or re-establishing – rules and ensuring transparency and responsibility. I was going to say restoring ethics where they had disappeared, in the financial markets, so that those markets, which we need, really do work for the benefit of the real economy. Rest assured, Ms Flašíková Beňová, that we will be carrying out this work for all the other sectors, in addition to the audit sector being discussed today. We have already done part of it with you, and you have many texts on your legislator’s table that are already being discussed and that will come to fruition by the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are talking today about one of those sectors, about some of its operators, namely external auditors, not all of whom, as we well know, did their job and managed to sound the alarm early enough during the financial crisis – which, incidentally, is not over. We have taken time to reflect because, in this area as in others, I want us to work together, seriously and without improvising. We have done a great deal of consulting and listening on this complex subject, and the European Parliament has been instrumental in this consultation work. For my part, I am very pleased that Parliament, thanks to the very high-quality report by Mr Masip Hidalgo, broadly supports this idea that I myself have of taking determined action at EU level to make up for the failings of the past.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I thank you, Mr Masip Hidalgo, for your personal commitment. I also applaud the work of several of your colleagues: Ms Swinburne, from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who spoke just now, and other Members who contributed to this consultation, Mr Gauzès, Mr Bodu, Mr López-Istúriz and Ms Berès.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report – and I say this in all sincerity – is in my view a very good foundation on which to work on the proposals that we are going to present in November. There are undoubtedly differences on certain points, and I am very much counting – as Ms Swinburne also said just now – on the determination and the contribution of the two committees, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to develop, together and quickly over the coming months, the new regulatory tools that we need. I am not going to respond to all the recommendations in Mr Masip Hidalgo’s report. I would just like to mention briefly three main aspects of our proposals: the independence of this profession, the opening-up of this audit market, and the creation of a large, more integrated European market, with the strengthening of supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, independence. Our main concern, which you also share, is the quality and credibility of audits. We need to restore confidence in companies’ accounts. This means that auditors must be independent from the entities they audit. Too often, we find that many companies keep the same auditing firms for long periods of time, decades even; they have even used them for a century – that has happened before now. The result is less confidence in the accounts of the companies concerned, which harms the profession and the companies being audited alike.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore not ruling out the idea of proposing, in November, the mandatory rotation of auditing firms, a well-managed rotation, after the appropriate period of time. Another factor contributing to the excessive familiarity between auditors and auditees is the provision, by auditors, of too many services described as ancillary or ‘non-audit’ services. For the majority of networks, these services generate more revenue than the audit itself. In these circumstances, are we really certain that objective judgments can be made and that completely independent audits can be carried out on a company that one is also advising on its development strategy? Ms Regner, you highlighted this point very clearly just now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore determined to limit, and indeed to prohibit in certain cases, the ‘non-audit’ services provided to audit clients. I believe in uniform rules for the whole of Europe in this area. I also wonder whether we ought not to go so far as to propose 100% audit firms, which would be unable to provide any other services but audits. This would also offer the advantage of opening up these ‘non-audit’ markets to small and medium-sized enterprises. Without this kind of measure, they have no chance of competing with the might of the major firms, as we can see today. We are still discussing the actual feasibility of this option – I need a few weeks to work on it – and its proportionality with regard to the issues at stake in this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second task is to ensure that the audit market is more open. Barely a generation ago, this market was shared between eight large auditing firms. Today, it is concentrated, and it is even more concentrated because the companies being audited are larger – Mr Tavares, you said this very clearly. Four firms control around 80% of the market in listed companies. This situation is even more concentrated in some countries, where we no longer talk about the ‘Big Four’ but about the ‘Big Three’ or the ‘Big Two’. In Germany, two firms alone hold 90% of the mandates of the main stock market index, the Dax 30. In Spain, we can even talk about the ‘Big One’, since a single firm certifies the accounts of the largest banks and holds 58% of the major listed companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have no ideological position on this subject, nor on any other subject for that matter. I want to be determined and pragmatic. Neither am I on a crusade against the ‘Big Four’, but I do not accept the fact that the market in auditing large companies should be dominated at this point by four large networks alone, when there are at least as many firms that would like to access this market in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want more operators, more competition and more dynamism, especially in this segment of the market. Several courses of action can be adopted, and we are working on this in order to boost the market: one is the joint audit solution. I am pleased to note, in this regard, that your report, Mr Masip Hidalgo, shares our view and that, if they are well balanced, joint audits could inject dynamism into the market. We are analysing the possible extension of this solution in Europe. I am also thinking about mandatory, regular, transparent and fairer calls for competition. In this context, I also hope to prohibit restrictive contractual clauses in favour of the ‘Big Four’. I feel that this current practice is unacceptable in a European market in which competition must be free, fair and genuine.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, my colleague, the Commissioner responsible for competition, Joaquín Almunia, and I are following the efforts of the national competition authorities with interest, and we will certainly also be looking at what other measures can be taken at European level to encourage the emergence of new international auditing firms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third and final task is to create, as Mr Paška mentioned, a large European market and to strengthen supervision. Paradoxically, this market, which is concentrated in too few hands, is still very fragmented in each of our countries. European integration is one solution to that. Common European rules would facilitate the free movement of professionals and improve the quality of audits and their supervision by supervisory authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to make the audit market more European, I intend to promote the idea of a European passport for auditors. We will take our inspiration, among other things, from certain solutions that have been found in the field of professional qualifications. I think it is unacceptable for auditors to have to take exams in every country they wish to work in.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will also be proposing the automatic recognition of firms that have already been approved in other States and the granting of a European quality label demonstrating the ability of all the firms concerned to audit larger companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, lastly, there is another way of contributing to the harmonisation of auditing rules in the European Union and of ensuring professional mobility, and that is – as you said, Ms Flašíková Beňová – by introducing International Standards on Auditing, or ISAs. We are currently examining the best way of doing this, and I agree with the parliamentary report that provisions need to be made for small and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, this is an issue on which my colleague Antonio Tajani focuses every day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to make three final, very important points. They concern the supervision of auditing firms and the transparency of their work. Firstly, we want the authorities supervising auditors to cooperate more. I am pleased that you share our view that this cooperation should take place within the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Now is not the time to create new bodies at European level. Let us use those that exist and make sure that they function properly, and in this way national supervisors – auditors – will also be able to benefit from ESMA’s experience.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I also wish to make national supervisory authorities more independent. They must be completely independent from auditors and their professional organisations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly and finally, as you put it very well in your report, Mr Masip Hidalgo, we will be recommending that audit reports contain more detail and more information. When carrying out their inspections, auditors gain an in-depth knowledge of the company they are auditing, and of its job types, organisation and risks. They have privileged access to a great deal of information. Unfortunately, it is not always reproduced in a structured way in their reports. This also applies to regulators, managers, audit committees and shareholders. This is another point that can be changed and improved, as Mr Masip Hidalgo has proposed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am very grateful to Parliament for its interest in and commitment to this issue. I wanted to give you the updated version of paragraph 13 of my deliberations myself, a few weeks away from the presentation by the Commission – which has been enlightened and encouraged by your report – of its legislative proposals.</p>

      <p sl="es">This report on audit policy, as its title states, aims to analyse lessons from the crisis. Given that one of the causes of that crisis was a loss of trust, which is the most important value for developed economies, with this resolution the European Parliament is proposing to strengthen that trust by means of auditing companies.</p>
      <p sl="es">This report is the result of a convergence of opinions; these may have been divided at the outset, but they have succeeded in establishing clear rules to strengthen the role of auditors. Nevertheless, instead of changing the market structure by penalising some of the major companies, the decision was taken to guarantee free competition and give greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can establish themselves in the market.</p>
      <p sl="es">On that point, may I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo for the work he has carried out in the Committee on Legal Affairs. This is an ambitious report that is going to require considerable development in order to accommodate everything that has been suggested. There were many lessons to be learned from the crisis, and this is a clear example of Europe’s will to draw the necessary impetus from the crisis in order to implement the mechanisms able to restore faith in the global economy. Audit policy is one of those.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my colleagues from the Committee on Fisheries, who have supported me in my work on the resolution we are discussing today. In particular, I should like to express my gratitude to Commissioner Damanaki and the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, with whom we have collaborated in recent months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The resolution is the product of many factors. It is very topical, as we begin the debate on the reform of the common fisheries policy. Moreover, the Black Sea basin, with its specific features and characteristics, will be included in it for the very first time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We already adopted, last year, a resolution on the Commission Green Paper on these reforms, as well as a resolution on integrated maritime policy. We are also currently engaged in a debate on the next budgetary period, for which we will have to decide on the most suitable financial measures for the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ever since Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union in 2007, the waters of the Black Sea have been part of the European maritime space. The other four countries – Turkey, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Georgia – are not part of this policy. Unfortunately, cooperation among these six countries in the area of fisheries had always been very limited in scope, if not non-existent. Furthermore, there is a lack of legal documents to regulate this activity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When drafting the report, I attended meetings in Ankara and Moscow with the institutions responsible for fisheries. The representatives of those two countries assured me that they were going to participate and cooperate in the development of a common agreement. The two countries control the majority of the fisheries and of the fishing industry in the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The data in the report on the ecological state of the Black Sea are very worrying: serious environmental problems, damaged ecosystems, altered flora and fauna, and endangered species. If urgent measures are not taken, we are in danger of having a dead sea.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is an urgent need for scientific research, which is insufficient today due to the lack of coordination among the countries and also because of the lack of funding. Secondly, current quotas are causing problems, because they do not reflect the true situation regarding fish stocks and are therefore creating the conditions for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a common problem and one that is difficult to resolve. Thanks to the excellent report by my colleague Ms Lövin, on which the Committee on Fisheries will be voting, we are going to take a strong stance against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Furthermore, until now, there has been no proper institutional structure for coordinating and managing fishing in the Black Sea, and the discussions and debates on its creation have already been going on for 10 years, without any concrete results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The powers of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean are clearly insufficient. Creating a separate organisation to manage regional fisheries in the Black Sea – as exists for the Baltic Sea for example – may help to manage and resolve the majority of these problems. That organisation should include all the countries in the Black Sea basin, monitor the status of stocks and define the parameters of in-depth scientific research.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Black Sea must take its place in the new common fisheries policy and in the integrated maritime policy. It must also ensure the livelihood of fishermen, and safeguard the industry, fish production and fish processing. These points must be taken into consideration in the new financial framework of the European Fisheries Fund after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I wish to highlight the fact that the report is aimed at establishing a long-term framework for the development of fisheries in the Black Sea. It is an economically, socially and politically important region. Coordinated fisheries management is an important part of the global strategy for the Black Sea and of cooperation within the Eastern Partnership.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor simply in order to lend my support to this report and to highlight two aspects in particular. The first, because it is part of the debate currently under way on the review of the common fisheries policy and on the fundamental decision relating to the regionalisation of a policy – a centralised policy – that has shown how utterly weak it is in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="it">This regionalisation phase is particularly relevant in the case of the Black Sea. I believe that the points contained in Ms Iotova’s report describe a specific situation, but one that is found in the rest of Europe, too: the situations in the Adriatic Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Aegean Sea are no different. In other words, the interaction between European fishing and non-European fishing, in particular, is often very harmful to European markets and to European consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second aspect that I should like to highlight quickly is that of the call for a European coastguard. There can be no policy without controls. Controls are carried out today by different forces in Europe; I believe that the time has come to recognise that one of the main security forces in Europe, namely coastguards, can be managed jointly, can become more interdependent and, indeed, can form a single European body. In the hope that this will happen, I fully support the contents of Ms Iotova’s report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this particularly important report for Black Sea fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I regard it as important for Romania, as a European Union Member State bordering this sea, to take an active part in developing the common fisheries policy, which is an important element at a time when the European Union is the second largest fishing power in the world, after China. In fact, Romania has a direct interest in the principles and action guidelines of this policy being applied to the Black Sea too, and especially in them being compatible with the specific regional features of the European Union states bordering the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this context, in terms of future funding, I think that, in order to fulfil the commitments it has taken on, Romania is interested in retaining a coherent financial instrument in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. To achieve this, a differential approach is required to providing support, in keeping with the convergence criterion and by giving greater consideration to specific regional features.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Iotova who presented this own-initiative report on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, as it makes a point, an example of the need to organise and harmonise fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">A specific policy for the Black Sea is required to harmonise and organise all the countries bordering the basin, whether they be EU or non-EU countries, which applies scientific criteria to determine fishing capacity. Diplomacy should be used as a harmonisation tool in the different countries to defend small-scale fishing, as many families and towns depend on it, and to favour environmental recovery. A regional fisheries organisation needs to be set up that is more in touch with the region and solves the issues. All of that needs to be done, with a budget, so that the Black Sea lives up less to its name and becomes a rather more hospitable environment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in recognition of the importance of the Organisation for Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the Convention on the protection of the Black Sea against pollution, and bearing in mind the Black Sea’s geostrategic importance to the European Union, we call on the Commission to devise an EU Strategy for the Black Sea, which will be integrated with the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Sea fishing is an important economic sector for the countries in the Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, which extended the scope of the common fisheries policy to the Black Sea. Black Sea fisheries face the following challenges: lack of cooperation in regional fisheries management, use of destructive harvesting methods, eutrophication and pollution, pollution from land-based sources and from direct discharges, loss of valuable spawning and breeding grounds and illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the Black Sea should enjoy the appropriate status in EU policies. With this in mind, sufficient diplomatic and scientific efforts should be made and ample financial resources provided to support sustainable fishing in this basin.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Iotova on this very good – and very important – report, which aims to establish a frame for the long-term development of the fisheries in the Black Sea region. It is important to underline that with this report, for the first time, the Black Sea basin will take its rightful place among the rest of the EU waters. Until now, the Black Sea has lacked coordinated action between all actors in the field of fisheries, and the focus on this important economic branch will encourage even further Black Sea cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should make all the necessary diplomatic efforts to attract the Black Sea States outside the EU as closely as possible to the principles of the common fisheries policy. One of the most significant points of the report, therefore, is the creation of a separate regional organisation for the management of fisheries, which would contribute to better policy coordination between the six States bordering the Black Sea. Thanks to the report, the specificities of the Black Sea were also taken into consideration, and improved management of fisheries will lead to further restriction of the illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing from which Bulgarian fishermen suffer greatly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the rapporteur – rightly so – has mentioned the specific ecological characteristics of the Black Sea region, as well as the specific socioeconomic characteristics that naturally also exist there. We have always advocated that local management that takes such characteristics into account and involves local people and communities is the best way to achieve what should be the objectives of a fisheries policy: to ensure the public supply of fish; to promote the development of coastal communities and employment; and to improve the living conditions of fisheries workers within a framework of ensuring resource sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the contrary, the kind of centralised management that has been advocated by the current common fisheries policy, and emphasised by the Treaty of Lisbon, distances us from these objectives, as has been proven in practice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We share many of the concerns expressed by the rapporteur in her report. We also agree with many of the rapporteur’s suggestions, from strengthening cooperation between riparian states to the importance of multiannual management plans and increasing scientific knowledge to support the necessary ecosystem approach to fisheries management.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, there are also certain factors that we cannot agree with, in particular the emphasis placed on a so-called European coastguard. This is not the appropriate framework for the vital development of cooperation among the Member States in the areas tackled in this report, and we do not understand why this issue has been included.</p>

    <intervention id="1-183-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">The Commission agrees with the Iotova report’s overall assessment of the situation: the Black Sea requires an improved and coordinated approach to regional fisheries management, scientific research and surveillance of fishing activities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As part of the integrated maritime policy, the Commission is currently working on a pillar for the Black Sea regional process with the aim of adapting the tools developed at EU level to the challenges faced by the region and to the opportunities for this basin. This strategy will be integrated into the EU Strategy for the Black Sea developed by the European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are pleased to see that the efforts to establish working groups with Russia and Turkey in order to discuss fisheries cooperation in a more detailed manner have been welcomed by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the future of regional governance, we are open to exploring the possibility of a new multilateral convention on fisheries management if the dialogue with the region goes in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, in line with Parliament’s conclusions, we have endeavoured to strengthen, in the short term, the role of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in the light of its existing powers in the region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We agree with the report’s conclusion that a stable, long-term system providing regular scientific opinions needs to be established. In the short term, the Commission has taken steps to ensure that the GFCM’s scientific advisory committee is involved to a greater extent and is kept up to date, and a first meeting on the Black Sea is scheduled for January 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the meantime, the Commission has been engaged in providing regular scientific opinions through the working group of its Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. Scientists from Ukraine, Turkey and the Russian Federation will take part in the meeting of that committee in October.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission shares the view expressed in the report concerning the need to carry out coordinated research and studies. It intends to contribute financially to the Black Sea-Fish project, which will be launched by the Food and Agriculture Organisation soon. Turkey is also one of the most enthusiastic supporters of this project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the most appropriate management measures, I think that we need to look in more detail at the advice on total allowable catches and quotas, as well as the management plans. We feel it is important to stress that they should not be regarded as mutually exclusive measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Cooperation is a key requirement in improving fisheries management in the Black Sea. The Commission is willing to join forces and work with the European Parliament and all the parties involved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you to everyone who has contributed to this report, including colleagues from many committees and industry regulator and environmental organisations. Offshore sources account for over 90% of the oil and 60% of the gas produced in the EU and Norway. This is the world’s fourth largest production area. Offshore is crucial to meeting Europe’s energy needs and its energy security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following last year’s tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico, it has been right to reassess safety regimes. However, much offshore oil development in European seas is off the coast of non-EU countries and it would be unwise if EU legislation pushed exploration out of EU waters into neighbouring areas - especially if a spill could still affect our seas and shores.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our approach to safety in EU Member States must enable inclusion of neighbouring countries and also recognise that issuing licences is a Member State – and not an EU – prerogative. As with many Parliament reports, this one contains some clear messages, but some of the statements are contradictory and a couple are factually incorrect. Hopefully, we can clarify this in tomorrow’s votes.</p>
      <p sl="en">All sites are different; not all deep water is dangerous and not all shallow water is safe. A ‘tick-box’ approach to safety allowed the Gulf of Mexico disaster to happen and we must not have the same in Europe. The report recommends a site-specific approach, with authorities and operators working together to address the individual risks of each installation, not only before drilling but at every stage of its working life. This must be backed up by rigorous independent oversight and inspections.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legislation must not compromise this goal-setting approach or sharing of good practice. Safety is not proprietary, and rapid sharing of information and good practices between operators and regulators is vital, especially in the case of significant incidents or near misses. A true safety culture is one that encourages every worker to put safety first in applying, improving and testing safety procedures. Whistle-blowers must be protected. Inspectors must be qualified and experienced and also understand the specific conditions of each site.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome regional fora that bring together regulators from individual sea areas as well as intra-fora and global coordination, as well as the recent work to build more qualified inspection networks across all seas. However, the report points out that creating a new EU super-regulator would not add value. Indeed, if it drained experienced resources from national inspectorates it could be damaging.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Gulf of Mexico disaster was compounded by the length of time it took to cap, contain and clean up. Recently there has been substantial investment in capping and cleaning equipment. The European Maritime Safety Agency has experience in monitoring and detecting spills and in the supply of clean-up equipment, so should maintain a log of all public and private equipment enabling its rapid deployment. However, EMSA does not have experience in spill prevention nor the expertise to regulate offshore installations.</p>
      <p sl="en">If negligence occurs, those responsible should be held accountable, and operators must be financially liable for costs and damage. They could meet this financial obligation in a number of different ways including, for example, mutual insurance funds which work best in individual sea areas. We know that there is currently not an active market for operators to purchase external insurance. Future legislation regarding financial liability should not exclude smaller operators, especially during the exploratory phases.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a moratorium on new exploration or a ban in the Arctic is not appropriate. Arctic exploration started in the 1920s. I repeat my earlier message: every site, every operation, should be assessed for its specific risks, and informed regulators should only allow drilling if they are comfortable that the risks of that site can be, and are being, managed. This should be the case in the Arctic, and indeed in every sea area.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Ms Ford for her report, which is very good, and I would like to point out that the accident on the Deepwater Horizon rig has also prompted a review of current legislation relating to offshore activities in the oil and gas sector by the European Union. We must reaffirm that responsibility for environmental and material damage lies firmly with the operator. The cost of preventing pollution must in all cases be borne by the operator and not by the public. Priority must always be given to prevention. The precautionary principle must be implemented in practice, but for this to happen we need to integrate the findings of impact studies into disaster prevention action plans.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The remit of the European Maritime Safety Agency needs to be expanded to include providing technical assistance and advice on safety issues relating to key activities in the offshore gas and oil sector. Focused regulation and monitoring must not mean that safety provisions create a more favourable environment for operators in some areas of the sector compared to others. We must also take small and medium-sized operators into account and ensure that they do not end up at a disadvantage.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, domestic oil and gas supplies have significant benefits in terms of energy security and energy consumption in the EU. More than 90% of our oil and 60% of our gas comes from offshore production, however this production is not equally distributed throughout the European Union. In the same way not all offshore activities relating to oil and gas production in European waters take place in waters under the control of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The aforementioned disaster in connection with the Deepwater Horizon platform was an incentive to all those involved in exploration and extraction of offshore oil and gas to re-evaluate the safety of their industries. Even if the oil and gas industries can boast improving results in the health and safety of their workers, focusing on the safety of personnel should not detract from the safety of their procedures, particularly in accident prevention and management. I firmly believe that the time is right to monitor the strict control and continuous testing and assessment of the environmental impacts of substances in order to ensure that they are harmless, even if they escape, thus avoiding an impact on public health and the environment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I must stress that drilling operations off the coast of one state can have a considerable impact on other Member States. This is why I feel it is necessary to set performance criteria for exploitation safety. European citizens, the environment and European industry must enjoy a high level of safety, while the relevant industry must have a simplified legislative framework and fair competitive conditions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I urge the Commission and Member States to examine the state-of-the-art practices used for exploration activities and offshore production and to propose improvements to the legislative framework. I also ask Member States and the Commission to ensure that the licensing system includes suitable financial instruments so that, in the event of major incidents, the necessary financial resources can be mobilised urgently to compensate for the economic, social and environmental losses caused by an oil spill or gas leak.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Before licences are awarded for offshore operations, I think that environmental impact assessments need to be carried out.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, experience and countless accidents have already proven that offshore oil and gas activities cannot continue to be carried out with the sole objective of deriving the maximum profit for the large companies involved in such activities, while jeopardising the safety of their workers and the general public.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is vital that very clear regulations be in place for protecting the environment, public interest, the workers involved and local residents, and that these regulations be complied with. It is vital that there be an effective surveillance procedure in place, that there be rigorous monitoring of what is happening and that public interest take precedence over private interest.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am grateful to Ms Ford for the work she has done, but I would like to point out that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution, one of the key points of which concerns the protection of sensitive natural areas, and specifically the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, granting exploration or exploitation licences means accepting liability, in the event of an accident of the kind we saw in the Gulf of Mexico and also in Scotland, for irreversible or very destructive damage in this unique part of the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, one is entitled to ask who is going to clean up this site in the event of an accident, since it is not an exclusive economic zone, and who defines its borders and hence the responsibilities relating to it: it is an area that belongs to everyone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to a number of points, the first of which is supervision. Supervision needs to be enhanced, but it would be good if it were carried out at European level and if the Maritime Safety Agency were responsible for it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, responsibilities need to be clearly defined. Amendment 76 establishes the full liability of oil companies, without any upper limit. At the same time, Amendment 47 defines civil liability, which covers not only environmental damage, but also social and economic damage, with guaranteed financial capacity to cover mandatory insurance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Including small oil companies in our deliberations is all well and good, but if they do not have any insurance, there is no point in granting them a licence. These points are therefore very important.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, following the accident on the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico, the Commission has presented an action plan aimed at maintaining and ensuring a higher level of safety and environmental protection in offshore gas and oil activities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament has broadly supported the Commission’s objectives. The meticulous, well-documented parliamentary report that we are discussing this evening confirms the complexity of offshore matters. I am particularly pleased to see that there are many similarities between your conclusions and those of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can assure you that the Commission fully shares your concerns regarding the need to avoid destabilising the offshore sector through inappropriate legislation. With that in mind, we are building on the best practices that exist in Europe and maintaining contact with the parties involved to ensure that our future proposals are based on concrete and realistic data.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Offshore gas and oil production has been, and will continue to be, an important source of energy for Europe. It is a large-scale industry whose safety standards are widely accepted to be an example of excellence. In order to maintain the highest level of overall safety, however, we must continue to make progress. Experience shows that one should never rest on one’s laurels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, the recent oil leak in a pipeline in the North Sea has further confirmed the need for measures. There is no easy solution where improving the safety of offshore operations is concerned. We believe that the responsibility for offshore oil and gas operations should rest with the industry and with national authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, our analysis also confirms that the European Union has an important role to play in various sectors. We must ensure that best practices are extended to the entire European Union; we must increase transparency in the industry and encourage the sharing of experiences. We must also improve our contingency plans in the event that our prevention efforts fail.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We see the European Union’s role as one of providing guidance and motivation in the ongoing work on these improvements. Some important work has already been carried out on the basis of the five-point plan on offshore safety. The Commission is currently finalising this proposal on offshore safety, accompanied by an impact assessment, which should be adopted around October time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These proposals are intended to be forward-looking and to offer a comprehensive solution so that we can address the shortcomings and the complexity of the current system and, above all, establish instruments to improve it permanently. These efforts must be shared by all of the parties involved, and the Commission welcomes the industry’s positive response to some of its calls for progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Safety and oil spills know no borders. That is why the Commission is also involved in sharing Europe’s experience of offshore safety with its international partners, notably within the G20.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I should like to thank you for your contribution to the debates on ways of improving the safety of our waters, and to stress that the Commission looks forward to cooperating closely with Parliament on the legislative proposal due this autumn.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which resulted from a huge oil spill, has led to concerns over the risks, responsibilities and legislation surrounding oil exploration and extraction being placed on the agenda. The report on EU action on oil exploration and extraction in Europe highlights the EU’s responsibility to ensure that its coasts are protected and that it has the capacity to respond to this type of natural disaster. I welcome the inclusion of the suggestions I tabled, especially with regard to European coordination and the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). As regards coordination throughout the EU and with neighbouring countries, it is necessary to ensure best practices and the harmonisation of the various approaches to both accident prevention and response used in the various regions of Europe. I would like to highlight the role of EMSA, located in Lisbon, which provides aid and technical assistance in the area of maritime safety and protection from pollution caused by ships. This report proposes extending EMSA’s competencies with regard to monitoring, information sharing and coordinating prevention and response.</p>

      <p sl="en">The committee’s rejection of calls for a moratorium on deep-sea oil and gas exploration was welcomed in the north-east of Scotland. The spectre of such a ban first emerged in the aftermath of last year’s disaster in the Gulf of Mexico; I hope that an overwhelming majority of MEPs will agree that such a move would be a ‘disproportionate reaction’. None of this is to say that MEPs – or people in the north-east of Scotland – should not take safety matters seriously. This summer’s leak from Shell’s Gannet installation shows that accidents can happen and that complacency is not an option. As well as oil, the North Sea provides thousands of jobs in the fishing and tourism sectors – sectors which are heavily dependent upon a clean environment. Scotland’s oil industry remains a vital industry – not solely in terms of Scottish jobs but in terms of European energy security too. An estimated 40% of oil and gas reserves remain to be extracted and the North Sea sector has a good few decades to go – if policy makers allow it to thrive. Political control of the resource must remain at national level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The accident on the drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico was a dangerous reminder. It was made clear that major ecological threats on continental shelves rise disproportionately with a rise in the difficulty of obtaining hydrocarbons from deep-sea wells. This requires new measures to improve monitoring of drilling conditions and to guarantee that uncontrolled leaks of crude oil will be sealed off while still under the sea bed immediately a jump in pressure occurs. Firms which carry out drilling should have to obtain a separate licence for each new well from the countries in whose territory they work. A condition for this should be the submission each time of confirmation that they have the technical capability to close down a well in the case of a sudden jump in pressure in the well, and also of confirmation that the work of the platform will be the subject of full ecological and meteorological monitoring. It is essential to have fire safeguards as well as technical and financial safeguards in the event of an accident. The European Union should support scientific research to enable innovative technical solutions to be found which will improve the reliability of the work of offshore drilling platforms.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In the wake of the US oil rig disaster Europe too wants to tighten up and standardise safety legislation relating to offshore oil and gas production. Ensuring smooth, safe extraction in European waters is also a priority in terms of security of supply, especially as the North Sea fields provide the lion’s share of Europe’s oil and gas. In connection with the report, I would like to highlight four vitally important issues. Firstly, I believe it is crucial that we involve third countries proactively in the process of tightening up safety legislation. Given that a significant portion of the North Sea reserves is controlled by countries outside the European Union, this is the only way to ensure a satisfactory solution. Secondly, I agree that we need sober action rather than a knee-jerk reaction: we need to define responsibilities clearly and implement appropriate preventive measures. Banning hydrocarbon extraction in European waters, on the other hand, would be a superfluous and disproportionate reaction to the events that have taken place. Thirdly, I believe it is the best way forward to take an approach that emphasises prevention rather than sorting out the damage after the event. More rigorous licensing procedures, standardised rules for awarding licences, compulsory independent auditing and training of personnel will all help to ensure that potential accidents are averted. Lastly, I support the fundamental principle that operators must carry the responsibility for any damage caused by them. Only by making operators financially liable will they have an adequate incentive to apply preventive measures and ensure the highest safety standards.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Marina Yannakoudakis, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on women entrepreneurship in small and medium-sized enterprises (2010/2275(INI)) (A7-0207/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="1-198-000" speaker_id="96944" name="Marina YANNAKOUDAKIS" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="United Kingdom" birth_date="16-04-1956" birth_place="London" p_group="European Conservatives and Reformists Group" m_state="GB">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, as governments face economic turmoil it is vital we harness existing resources to the maximum, and one of the best resources we possess are companies and businesses which can help create the wealth that is needed in a successful and vibrant economy. However, when we look at small and medium-sized enterprises today, we find they are still mainly run by men, which means that much of the population fails to reach its potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report recognises the value of women entrepreneurs in SMEs and acknowledges that women face many different problems in different Member States in attaining their objectives. The report also recognises the contribution women in employment can make both to the local community and to the economy of the EU, and points out clearly that women have the right to choose the role they play within the home or the community they live in. Many women have to juggle their own aspirations to succeed alongside their commitment to their family. The aim of the report is to make this choice a reality through practical guidelines and best practice recommendations which Member States could adopt if they so wish.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU Member States differ in their approach to women looking to run their own businesses and in the support they give these women. Whilst researching my report, I found that the difficulties women faced in setting up SMEs within Member States were more or less the same. Often they were unaware of the mechanics needed to start a business, they lacked the confidence or were unsure where to seek advice, and found financial institutions unsympathetic to their specific needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">To address these difficulties I proposed a few amendments such as: firstly, to make better use of funding opportunities that are available to female entrepreneurs which allow fair and equal access to finance; secondly, we need to embrace national education concepts for young entrepreneurship in schools, for example, or to encourage female one-year entrepreneurship or apprenticeship programmes in universities; thirdly, we could recognise the importance of female ambassadors as they help promote competitiveness by inspiring women and young girls to set up their own businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contribution to drafting the report, which I felt strengthened it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are going to be holding separate votes on paragraphs 34, 44 and 46, which relate to Romani women, migrant women and balanced representation on boards. All these topics are very important in their own right, but they are not really relevant in a report that specialises in women and SMEs, so for this reason I am not going to be supporting these separate votes.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a woman who has been running my own company for 25 years, I know first hand the problems women can encounter when trying to establish a viable SME. I hope that this report will be adopted by the European Parliament, and that ultimately Member States will be able to use it as a basis for supporting women who wish to move forward in this field, for in spite of all the constraints and restrictions upon them, women have proved to be more than capable in the workplace when starting a business.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recognising women’s ability in the workplace, and assisting them through media such as an EU report to strengthen their position, is vital. This will not only encourage women to move into the world of business, but will ensure when they move into it there is an even playing field and there is no room for gender discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her work and thanking her for her openness and cooperation in reaching compromises that gained broad support. Today, it is vital to discuss small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurship, with regard to both men and women. Despite the major difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises have been facing over the past few years, they do indeed continue to play an important role in job creation and are a driving force for economic growth in Europe. Female entrepreneurship should be encouraged as it has enormous potential to be exploited and it is a way of increasing employment rates.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this report, the rapporteur requests and recommends that the Member States adopt measures for reconciling family and professional life in order to encourage women to start up their own businesses. We also agree with the recommendations on the need for advice on the methods of funding and financial management available, as well as the importance of accessing finance, particularly microfinance, and to promote, in this respect, the EU Progress programme.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I should like to clarify the position on the content of paragraph 46 by saying that, in the interests of legality, consistency and thoroughness, we shall vote on this paragraph separately as I do not object in the slightest to equal representation of men and women on the boards of large companies and stock exchange-listed companies, which is not currently the case.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President compared to standard employment, self-employment brings more flexibility in relation to working time and the place of employment, and thus allows flexibility to combine work tasks with care for children and family, which is the foundation for a healthily functioning society.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I find it sad that in the European Union only one in 10 women is self-employed, compared with a ratio of 1:4 in men, despite the fact that women make up about 60% of all university graduates. The Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities should, therefore, make better use of the potential of women by creating new financing options designed specifically for women, such as special grants, the adjustment of social security regulations and an improvement in the provision of microcredit to women wishing to start their own small business. In this respect it is necessary to appeal directly to Member States to encourage banks to create business support services geared towards women.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the current economic and financial crisis affecting the states of the European Union has added to the problems women entrepreneurs are already facing, particularly in the early stages after launching an economic venture. We are all aware what an important role micro-enterprises play in the European economy. Around 90% of European businesses have less than 10 employees, with more than a quarter being set up by unemployed people.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I feel it is vital for the Union to retain financial support for women entrepreneurs in the next budget too. Indeed, the tax benefits provided for SMEs should be available to all entrepreneurs without discrimination. It is also important for the participation of women in entrepreneurial activities to be promoted more widely on the European labour market, including with the aim of exchanging experiences and good practices and of streamlining resources.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, it is with regret that we must still even today state that women in the labour market continue to be discriminated against even within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We most commonly hear of differences in salary. However, in practice women have fewer opportunities also when establishing or operating SMEs. Women also face barriers when accessing information support and financial and technological instruments and services, which often limit their opportunities to expand their business and compete for example for governmental or municipal tenders. It is important to recognise that the working and entrepreneurial skills of women are important to us and for society as a whole, and in so doing we would also strengthen their position. Not only does this encourage women to break into the world of business, but by taking properly implemented steps we could ensure that women enjoy truly equal conditions and that gender discrimination is eliminated.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, according to the statistics, the financial and economic crisis has exacerbated the problems for many women entrepreneurs, especially in the first three years of business. This is why we encourage the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities to make better use of the funding opportunities available, such as the European Progress Microfinance Facility, which provides micro-credits of up to EUR 25 000 to micro-enterprises and those wishing to start their own micro-enterprise.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For women to become entrepreneurs, it is important that they have equal access to traditional business networking opportunities and to information and communication technologies. Another key consideration for working women is the availability and quality of care services for children under the age of three.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission and Member States to pay particular attention to the situation of women over the age of 50, to help them set up their own companies and to consider the creation of mentoring and support schemes for them.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the current crisis is having a particularly significant impact on women, particularly those on lower incomes. Growing unemployment among women and the surge in precarious and poorly paid jobs are contributing to an increase in the number of women living in poverty and are creating conditions for greater discrimination and exploitation. It is in this context that many women are forced into false self-employment – a bogus type of self-employment that is only used to circumvent social protection and exclude these workers from basic workers’ rights in order to reduce labour costs. This is an unacceptable practice that must be opposed. It is clear that there are women entrepreneurs in small and medium-sized enterprises who should naturally be supported by ensuring that there is no form of discrimination here either, and, in this respect, we would like to stress the need to adopt certain measures that have already been discussed here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, SMEs make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation. However, one distinctive feature of the European business environment is the inequality between men and women. The latter account for only 30% of all entrepreneurs in Europe. This discrimination is detrimental to both women and the economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Europe must have programmes available to encourage and support women in business. I am in favour of creating an agency for developing businesses set up and run by women. I think that a European database needs to be set up to implement a proper policy for women entrepreneurs. The business potential offered by women must be utilised more effectively at local, regional, national and European level.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, by way of introduction I would like to say that I appreciate the efforts of the European Parliament regarding the targeted gradual improvement of the position of women in European society.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In various reports, recommendations, and regulations we call on the Member States to create better conditions in their legal systems for the employment of women in public administration, the business environment, in management positions, and also in regular employment or work at home. Although it is indisputable that these efforts exerted by the European Parliament bring certain results, I believe that, alongside other proposals for improving the status of our women, such as in this case in their application in the business environment, we should make greater efforts to evaluate the feedback on the proposed measures to see which of the measures are effective and help us meet the expected targets and which measures, for some reason, do not work. We might then be able to more effectively propose further steps to improve the status of our women and possibly also in the business environment.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the financial and economic crisis has worsened the problems faced by entrepreneurs, including many potential women entrepreneurs. Women under the age of 25 and over 50 have been worst affected by the financial crisis, so we need to pay particular attention to these age groups. Despite the tremendous potential represented by women running their own business and women entrepreneurs in SMEs in terms of increasing employment among women, this has not been fully exploited in the European Union. It is vital to encourage women to enter into business, and to provide the sort of support that ensures the most efficient use of EU resources. Member States must continue to implement policies that enable women to balance work and private life appropriately.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is important to recognise the ability and value of women entrepreneurs in SMEs. In order to strengthen their position and ensure continuous improvement of their situation in the workplace, we must find financial resources that can be targeted at this group, both at EU level and in the Member States, even in the present economic climate.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, women have a more difficult labour market situation because of persistent discrimination against gender and age, with still significant wage gaps, concerns about family care and so on. Furthermore, members of the gentler sex have less ambition in times of crisis to launch their own business. I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s own-initiative report, in that today it is essential to support women in business so that they do not lose motivation and that they feel that they have support for their qualifications, abilities, skills and talent. Personally, I very much welcome the initiative of the Erasmus educational programme, which will be dedicated to the support of young women − future entrepreneurs. I also support the appeal made by our rapporteur to the Member States to seek new sources of funding or subsidies for women − entrepreneurs in particular, so that women have equal opportunities and possibilities to access the same finance and grants as men. Women need to feel that they have support also in the form of advice and assistance in the event of business failure. It would therefore be useful to also focus on the building of platforms at a supranational level for the exchange of knowledge and experience when addressing specific problems.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the European Union is right in wanting to develop women entrepreneurship by cofinancing innovative small and medium-sized enterprises with micro-credits. However, it is time to up the ante. Apart from the need to combat gender inequalities and reconcile family and professional obligations, emphasis needs to be placed on economic support and training for women entrepreneurs under business guidance programmes at the start of and during their business activities, on familiarising them with new information and communication technologies – because they open new horizons and opportunities for innovative employment – and, finally, on including special programmes and activities in school and university curricula and highlighting positive standards to stimulate self-confidence and develop business activity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I should like to thank Ms Yannakoudakis for this significant report. It is still the case that there are more male than female entrepreneurs in the EU. An institution like the Office of Women’s Business Ownership in the United States is an absolute necessity for the EU if female entrepreneurs are to receive support throughout the EU. Women are capable of multitasking and usually take a more cautious and prudent approach. It is crucially important for current social development that more women should get involved in the world of business.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Commission has proposed some concrete measures to promote female entrepreneurship within the scope of the Small Business Act for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first measure was the creation of the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors in 2009. We have managed to get entrepreneurs involved in campaigning on the ground in order to encourage women of all ages to set up their own business and become entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Role models are very important when it comes to motivating a person to set up a new business. Today, we have 320 ambassadors in 22 European countries. This network has been a success; in its first year of operating, it has already exceeded its objectives in terms of holding events and meeting the public’s expectations: there are over 7 500 potential female entrepreneurs in 10 countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, many ambassadors have gone beyond the task they were set, which was simply to campaign for female entrepreneurship. They have actively supported the creation of new businesses. Thanks to their work, in the six participating countries – we do not have any data on other countries – more than 110 new female-run businesses have been set up.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is preparing to launch the European Network of Mentors for Women Entrepreneurs on 15 November. This scheme is aimed at women who have already set up their business. We are going to enlist the support of female entrepreneurs so that they can act as mentors to new female entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These mentors will help female entrepreneurs by offering them advice and support on start-ups, management and the development of their business. They will be selected at national level by the contractors participating in the scheme and will be successful, well-known entrepreneurs.</p>

      <p sl="it">Entrepreneurs of both genders are, by definition, focused on their business and committed to making a success of what they do. Although women account for a significant proportion of the labour force in the Member States, men still outnumber women as entrepreneurs in the EU. Currently, in fact, EU Member States have each taken different approaches to supporting and promoting women in decision making and in the boardroom. The different support systems that have been developed over time in the Member States address the cultural and individual needs of the country concerned. Faced with this situation, the Commission is administering a voluntary group of women ambassadors in Member States that provide valuable technical support to female entrepreneurs. I agree with the rapporteur that more support should be given to this initiative and that best practices should be shared. There is no denying the valuable contribution that female workers can make both to the community and to the economy of the European Union. Many of them skilfully juggle their career aspirations with their family commitments, which is not easy. I therefore encourage the Member States in all the initiatives they are taking to support and promote projects aimed at women entrepreneurs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU, but inequalities remain in terms of entrepreneurship or decision-making power in most European states. According to the statistics, the number of women entrepreneurs is considerably lower than that of men, at a rate of around 30%.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Given the major contribution made by small and medium-sized enterprises to economic development, it is important to encourage investment readiness among women, already while they are at school. At the same time, we must fight to get rid of the gender stereotypes which persist from one generation to another. I think that it would also be useful to have an exchange of good practices between more economically developed and poorer regions in the EU, including through Erasmus-type programmes for young entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this same context, I believe that better use must be made of the funding opportunities available to women entrepreneurs, such as the European Progress Microfinance Facility. Last but not least, specific attention must be focused on providing childcare facilities to allow women to continue their career soon after having their children.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The number of women entrepreneurs in the European Union is significantly fewer than the number of men involved in business. However, the former make a significant economic contribution within society. In my view, in order to strengthen their position, it is vital to recognise the skills of women in the workplace and support them through the use of mass media. In doing so, it will not only encourage women to advance in business, but will also provide a fair environment where gender-based discrimination has no place. On the same lines, impetus should be provided for the conclusion of agreements between national governments and banks, with a view to granting favourable loans to encourage women to go into business.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I know from my own experience what it is to be a woman entrepreneur, because I ran my own business before I went into politics. Therefore it is with great enthusiasm that I will vote in favour of this report, which promotes entrepreneurship among women. We need women in business, and particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many young, well-educated women who unfortunately are unemployed. I think that running their own business would for some of them be a very good option. We must encourage and help women in making their first steps towards this goal. What they need most of all is help in the form of information on potential sources of finance for small and medium-sized enterprises and on grants, preferential loans and the possibilities of using the European Progress Microfinance Facility. No less important is training and vocational guidance for those women who do not have practical knowledge about how to understand legislation or how to find investors and create viable business plans. To generate a natural increase of interest among women in running their own business it is necessary to teach entrepreneurship, and to do so in the early years of schooling, which will not only increase the proportion of female entrepreneurs in the market, but will also be useful in the fight against stereotypes, which result in discrimination and the perception of women as being unable to run their own business.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-217-000" speaker_id="23866" name="Edit BAUER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Slovakia" birth_date="30-08-1946" birth_place="Šamorín" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="SK">
      <p sl="hu">Madam President, have you noticed that we almost never see presenters over the age of 50 on our television screens? And if we do, it is more than likely to be a man. Have you ever noticed that there are far fewer women in their 50s than men in the workplace? The statistics show that 55% of men in their 50s are engaged in the labour market, compared with only 37% of women of the same age. Statistics on this age group are thin on the ground, and most of the available data you will find if you look on the Internet, for example, are American or Australian. European data are harder to find. Meanwhile, governments and parliaments are taking steps to increase the retirement age – I just heard today about British government plans relating to this. If you analyse the evidence, however, it shows that people are leaving the world of work much earlier.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One of the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy is to raise employment levels for both men and women to 75%. This begs the question: what can we do, and what must we do to prevent people from leaving the labour market prematurely? Of course, to be able to answer this question we also need to know the reasons why people are leaving early. There may be many reasons why women leave the world of work earlier than men. Let us look at a few examples. In many career paths, women face discrimination. Indeed, the discrimination they face is often not straightforward, but complex. The absence of older women from our TV screens can be put down to age-related discrimination, or ‘ageism’. And this of course is not the only field where ageism is blatantly in evidence.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Often it is social necessity that drives women out of the labour market, or it may be a voluntary response to a situation in which a family member needs looking after. Other reasons include illnesses, some of which could be avoided given adequate preventive health care. Think, for example, of breast cancer or osteoporosis. The working environment, conditions in the workplace, occupational health and safety, all of these of course fall into the same category. Designating 2012 as the European Year of Active Ageing opens the way for action aimed at improving this situation. The consequences of the current situation of women over 50 are undeniably serious: the gender pay gap is widest at this time in women’s working lives; the discrepancy between men’s and women’s pay is at its peak in this age group.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This, along with more frequent career interruptions, a higher incidence of part-time work and slower career progression all result in much lower average pensions for women. The number of older women at risk of poverty is therefore disproportionately high. The aim of this report is clear: to set out steps to improve this situation – not only to tackle discrimination, although this too is a real problem. Indeed, when questioned, a majority responded that age-related discrimination is very real, based on their own experience. The report sets out other lessons too: prevention costs less than tackling the consequences, and this is equally true in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One of the most important conclusions is that the long-awaited white paper on pension reform must take account of the issues that are specific to women’s lives. Any period or periods spent raising children or caring for family members should not mean a loss of social security entitlements. Both of these care-giving activities are likely to become increasingly important in society with time and demographic changes. Unless we create appropriate employment opportunities and social conditions more generally, we stand no chance of fulfilling the Europe 2020 strategy targets relating to employment or combating poverty.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I welcome Ms Bauer’s report. It describes the situation in very specific terms: ongoing demographic change continues to bring with it a dramatic deterioration in the situation of older women. Older women are more likely to suffer poverty. Women have a shorter professional career, which is interrupted by the need to bring up children and care for relatives. On average they also earn less than men. Unemployment is higher among women than men and women are four times more likely to be employed on a part-time basis. They certainly work for a living, but do not always receive payment in return. Low income levels among women also impact on their pension rights and increase the risk of poverty in old age.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the report also points to some positive aspects. Older people are an enormous source of cultural, social and professional enrichment. Their contribution to society is all too often ignored and their involvement is not sufficiently encouraged. The challenge to society is to respect people’s capabilities, to keep them in the labour market for longer and to ensure that they remain healthy, active and independent long after they have entered retirement.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, economic competitiveness and prosperity in Europe increasingly depend on the effective use of the workforce. The unavoidable extension of working life must be done sensitively and together with the creation of decent age-appropriate working conditions and social security systems. In the name of solidarity between the generations, Member States should, in particular by means of regional and local authorities, create support programmes for women – entrepreneurs in synergy with the active aging programmes that would directly involve experts from among the ranks of entrepreneurs currently at pre-retirement and retirement age in the creation of new jobs and opportunities. I would like to highlight the remarkable and praiseworthy work carried out by carers and nurses who, despite the often unfavourable legal framework and financial remuneration, assist the most vulnerable members of our society and the fight against the social exclusion of people with disabilities so as to enable them to lead a dignified life.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in a world of globalisation, intergenerational solidarity is important in terms of professional development of the younger generations, especially through tapping the potential offered by older people. The example and experience offered by older women is a valuable economic resource, providing a proper font of experience that can offer real support to the community. I think that any measures which help enhance equal opportunities policies must be encouraged so as to prevent, as far as possible, the prevalence of certain discriminatory attitudes towards women approaching retirement age.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also believe that women need to be encouraged to resume their professional career after maternity leave and to retrain for a different career so as to avoid breaks in their promotion and career development path and having an inadequate pension at the end of their career.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, discrimination among older women is one of the major social problems we are facing, and it is one of the fundamental causes of poverty and social exclusion. These women have often been victims of low wages, of unemployment, and of part-time and precarious work, which is reflected in very low pensions, putting them in a position of great social vulnerability and at risk of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In a period of worsening unemployment, such as now, there should be a particular focus on the situation of women approaching retirement age. Firstly, the retirement age should not be raised, to ensure women are not discriminated against on the basis of parenthood and age. Secondly, women’s work should be promoted, equal pay should be enforced and the procedure for calculating pensions and benefits should be revised to ensure that ageing is a dignified process that is free from humiliation, discrimination or any form of violence towards older women. That also requires quality public services at affordable prices, particularly in the areas of health, social protection and decent housing.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, this report focuses on women approaching pre-retirement age, the age between 55 and 64 years. It is alarming that in 21 Member States of the European Union the employment of women in pre-retirement age compared to the employment of males of the same age is up to 20% lower. The existence of such gender inequality against women nearing the end of their careers is a possible cause of a number of negative social impacts. Overcoming gender discrimination, particularly after the age of 50, should therefore be a priority for Member States with regard to the social and legal protection of their citizens so as not to weaken the role of women in the labour market. I therefore call on the Commission to ensure the establishment of rules for Member States which will help women remain in the labour market and which will also consistently modify social systems by eliminating gender discrimination, particularly in the area of pension systems.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the labour market is certainly one of the areas where there is discrimination against women. Women are not adequately guaranteed the right to work and the percentage of unemployed women in Europe is increasing. Young women entering the labour market and women at pre-retirement age who are pushed into part-time work are discriminated against most. Women over 50 are discriminated against most purely on account of their age, gender and health. However, let us not forget that older women provide a huge benefit to society. They take care of their families, children and grandchildren, and often take part in voluntary activities. Most European women have worked all their lives and it is unfair that they are denied this right, if they are not prevented from working by their health in old age, and if they have decades of experience. It is precisely for this growing population group that the risk of poverty and social exclusion is growing. I therefore urge the Commission, in the spirit of the upcoming Year for Active Aging, to take the necessary measures to keep them in the labour market, including the provision of social security, pensions and health care.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, it is a fact that elderly people aged between 55 and 64 are subject to ageism, to age discrimination. Women in particular experience this discrimination, as well as other forms of gender discrimination due to their sex, preconceived notions, poor health or disability. The fact that 2012 will be a year of active support is encouraging, because it provides a unique opportunity for further awareness-raising about the need to mainstream the gender and age dimension in all policies, in order to prevent social exclusion and any form of racism towards the elderly.</p>
      <p sl="el">In an ageing Europe, we cannot afford to look on the ageing population as a social and economic burden. On the contrary, we have a duty to combat prejudice, to support active ageing with programmes and activities and to safeguard equal access for everyone to health care and long-term care.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking the MEPs, and in particular Ms Bauer, for drafting this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Equal economic independence for women and men is one of the priority areas of our Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015. We will achieve the objective of a 75% employment rate for women and men only if we adopt national policies aimed specifically at increasing women’s participation in the labour market and reducing the disparities between women and men, particularly among women over 50.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission fully appreciates that women approaching retirement age find themselves in an unusual situation, since they may help their adult children to bring up their family, or they may care for their elderly parents. A better work-life balance is crucial if we want to see an increase in the number of women in work and an extension of their pension rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission recognises the major role that paternal leave and care leave, alongside the other available instruments, play in the achievement of these objectives. It has therefore commissioned some studies to evaluate the costs and benefits of these two types of leave. The results are due at the end of the year. On the basis of these two studies, the Commission will decide what action to take in respect of these measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report rightly emphasises that women over 75 are more exposed to the risk of poverty than men in the same age bracket. Poverty among women may certainly be the result of insufficient pension cover, but more often than not it is also due to the shortness of their careers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore vital that women’s careers are just as long as those of men. Setting the same retirement age for women and men is one way of achieving this. Measures need to be taken, within the scope of the pension system, to compensate for career breaks. Current legislation guarantees that women will accrue pension rights during their maternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our White Paper on pensions is still being drafted, and the Commission will be considering the options for improving pension provisions for women. Next year we will examine, together with the Member States, the fitness for purpose of the pension system, and we will publish a report on this subject at the same time as the report on ageing. This report will focus on the situation of retired women who suffer from poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over the next few months we will continue to work closely with the parties concerned in drafting the White Paper, and we are counting on your active involvement, which will enable us to base the measures that we will be proposing on the best possible evidence and the best possible contributions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union is faced with a significantly ageing population due to the low birth rate, the increase in life expectancy and the forthcoming retirement of the baby-boom generation. The European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations will be an important opportunity to demolish the argument that an ageing population is a social and economic burden, and to show how much of an asset women and men of this age group are.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to warmly congratulate Ms Bauer for her excellent report on the situation of women approaching retirement age. Our continent has the highest proportion of elderly women in the world, who frequently face double discrimination in the labour market, based both on age and gender. As a consequence of the rising divorce rates and the shorter life-expectancy of men, women are often and increasingly over-represented among the isolated elderly. Widows and lone elderly women in general are at a higher risk of poverty, isolation and social exclusion. Yet elderly women approaching retirement age represent a significant resource for tackling the ingravescent demographic challenges the EU must face, so we must ensure that they can stay healthy and active as well as remain in the labour market if they wish. Member States need to adequately address the multiple discrimination that older women are facing in seeking access to employment, also by exchanging best practices in improving the quality of working conditions of older women in order to create for them a sustainable and healthy workplace.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The group of women to whom in official documents we refer diplomatically as ‘approaching retirement age’, or for media purposes as ‘50+’, were once called by the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk ‘invisible in society’. Therefore, I am very pleased that next year the ‘invisible’ will become visible, thanks to the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations. Employment levels of women over 55 are too low today in Europe for the Union to be able to achieve the target of 75% employment of women and men between the ages of 20 and 64 which we set ourselves in the Europe 2020 strategy. We will not achieve this target if employment among women does not rise. In Poland, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy is running a programme entitled ‘Solidarity between the Generations’ – a package of government measures intended to increase employment in Poland among people who are over 50. It is shocking that in the labour market women who are many years younger than men are often considered to be too ‘old’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I have read the motion for a resolution on the situation of women approaching retirement age, and would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur. It is a significant and very important subject, because an ever increasing number of women over the age of 50 are being affected by the double problem of discrimination on the basis of their age and their sex, and they are more and more often becoming part of a group of isolated older people. In the light of the facts and statistics referred to by the rapporteur, the fact that the year 2012 has been designated as the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations should be all the more welcomed. In Poland, too, action is being taken to raise the vocational qualifications of women and enable them to begin an active life at a more advanced age. In many towns and cities, training is being held for older women, including training in computer skills and bookkeeping skills, and careers advice is being offered. Considering the fact that the proportion of the population aged 65+ is projected to increase from 17.4% in 2010 to 30% in 2060, such action should be intensified yet further, so as to make it possible for every woman to improve her vocational qualifications and sustain an active life.</p>

      <p sl="de">Older women are discriminated against on two counts on the labour market: because of their gender on the one hand, and because of their age on the other. The consequence for women aged 65 and over is the prospect of a poverty-stricken old age. The increase in atypical, precarious employment, mostly involving women, is a growing problem in Europe. We must ensure that women aged between 55 and 64 remain in the labour market and are not sidelined. We must also to create the conditions that allow them to return to work. In the context of 2012 as the Year for Active Ageing, it is particularly important that the European Commission should redouble its efforts to improve the situation of older women and increase their participation in the labour market. Strengthening equality policy and increasing training opportunities are just two ways in which we can improve the situation of older women in the labour market in the long term. A good work-life balance is the key here. Different phases in life are associated with different demands on women in terms of family and professional commitments and should not be punished with pension reductions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In accordance with the approach contained in the Europe 2020 strategy, the most important social objectives are now the fight against poverty, discrimination and the ageing of society, while at the same time striving to avoid or ease tensions between generations. This is why it is so important to introduce specific, long-term measures for the labour market and the pensions system. In many EU Member States, this will involve a considerable number of changes. The common practice of discrimination based on age and sex means that only one in three women approaching retirement age can count on having a job, and this is often a part-time and poorly-paid job. Often their good state of health, their willingness to work and particularly their skills and qualifications would allow them to have a full-time job for many years to come. The rapporteur has rightly drawn attention to the need for lifelong education and the creation of opportunities for obtaining new qualifications to enable people to stay in the labour market. It is essential to put in place measures to popularise flexible forms of employment, which will allow women to reconcile their working lives with their personal lives. The greatest challenge is to work on changing the attitude of employers to older people and to remove the pressure to retire at a fixed age. Let us remember that older people have full rights, and, as is shown by research, are the most loyal employees. Particularly when faced by problems with having to pay the benefits guaranteed to citizens in many of the EU’s Member States, we should take notice of the potential of the 50+ generation.</p>
