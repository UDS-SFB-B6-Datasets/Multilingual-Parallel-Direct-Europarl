    <intervention id="2-011" speaker_id="1295" name="Terence WYNN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="United Kingdom" birth_date="27-06-1946" birth_place="Wigan" p_group="Socialist Group in the European Parliament" m_state="GB">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I consider this report, which we will vote on later today, to be one of the most important reports that this Parliament will vote on during this session. I say that not because it is in my name, but because of its content and the great deal of hard work that has gone into it. I thank those from the Court, the Commission, those Member States with which I have had dealings and also the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Without them this report would not be the document that it is, and I give them heartfelt thanks.</p>
      <p sl="en">If its recommendations are implemented by the institutions, then the Holy Grail of a positive Statement of Assurance – DAS – will be in sight. However, to get to that point we will need some real commitment and cooperation from the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">From paragraph 25 onwards, the report outlines the lack of perfection within the DAS methodology. It makes the point that the money within our accounts can be totally legal and regular but that, at the same time, it can be absolutely wasted. That is one of the main failings of the DAS and why the report’s recommendations encourage the Court to improve upon the changes it has already made.</p>
      <p sl="en">From the Commission’s point of view, whatever the DAS methodology improvements may be, the Commission and the Member States still need to make changes. The Commissioner must do several things. As with every report this Parliament votes on, we always ask the Commission to do extra things. And apart from such items as implementing a Community internal control framework, we are asking that. Here, however, a contentious matter in certain areas, certainly within the Commission itself, is an issue raised in paragraph 8 and Amendment 4. I would wholeheartedly call on Members to support this amendment, which calls on the Accounting Officer to sign off the Commission accounts. It must be said that until that is agreed, the Commission will always be attacked, and Amendment 4 spells that out quite clearly. I have a lot of respect and regard for Commissioner Kallas and I am encouraged by his positive attitude. I call on him not to let the battle of hierarchies within the directorates-general prevent this from being implemented. It is a key part of these recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, whatever we ask the Court and the Commission to do, the positive DAS will not be attainable unless the Member States accept their responsibilities, which include their political responsibilities in the control and management of European Union funds. Paragraph 16 outlines the problems quite clearly. The Disclosure Statement, as described in paragraph 19, shows how the problems can be solved.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is trying to anchor the Member States’ responsibilities not only at administrative level but also at a political level. This is, after all, a shared management process. It is about time that the other half of this shared management began taking its responsibilities more seriously. In that context, the report states – near the end of my section – that progress is not possible without Member States’ active participation. That is why the committee and the report, if it is adopted, proposes to invite you, Mr President, in your speech to the next European Council, to address the need to improve Member States’ financial management of funds from the European Union. I hope you can do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">For me, this report has been a fascinating exercise. It is the culmination of ten years of trying to see a positive Statement of Assurance. Ten years ago I said that there would never be a positive DAS with the systems that were in place, and these included the DAS methodology. Today I can say that if this report is adopted, then I am confident that a positive DAS, that Holy Grail I mentioned before, is certainly within reach.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank you for entrusting me to express an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control about a matter which is very important to us all.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today with our vote on the approval of the European Parliament's 2003 budget we shall give our position. A position as to whether our institution, the European Parliament, is using funds, money given by all the citizens of Europe, our electors, correctly and transparently. I would also like to thank my colleagues who have actively contributed to the preparation of this report with their advice and efforts. They presented their proposals and amendments and participated in discussions. There were discussions in the Committee on Budgetary Control and lively debate in my own political group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Liberals and democrats have always defended and will continue to defend people's right to truthful information, to openness and transparency, as this is the basis of democracy. We know that openness and transparency are not ends in themselves. They are means of ensuring the efficiency of the institution and, most importantly, its accountability to the people. To those people for whom this institution works. The citizens of Europe are becoming increasingly intolerant of ignorance and a lack of information, and are becoming more demanding of those who they entrusted with their votes, those who they elected to this House. They want the money they have paid to bring surplus value, that is to be used purposefully and effectively.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Let me briefly present my report that is the report approved by the Committee on Budgetary Control. This report differs from previous reports in that 2003 saw the introduction of a new finance management system together with the establishment in the European Parliament of an internal audit system. This is a giant step towards more sound and more transparent budget planning and utilisation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Thus we would like to congratulate you, Mr President, and the services of the Bureau. Another new development is that from this year onwards the task of approving budget implementation shall be given to the President of the European Parliament, not the Secretariat of the Bureau, as was done previously. In the report attention is mainly devoted to four topics.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Firstly, management, how the main decision makers report, that is the Bureau and Quaestors. Here the rotation principle is proposed.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The second topic is the utilisation of money allocated to political groups. It should be pointed out that certain progress has been achieved in this regard, that is transparency in the utilisation of funds, by publishing information on the web. Areas for improvement, however, are also indicated: in the report it is proposed that political groups should draw up standard annual accounts and declare the utilisation of funds publicly.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Thirdly, payments to Members of Parliament. This is a long-standing debate. Then there are the arguments between institutions and, most importantly, various interpretations and suspicions as regards the non-transparent system. The news that following the accession of the new countries, some Members' salaries are 12 times higher than others’ is an unpleasant fact. I believe this is unfair – we all work in the same European institution and we should be paid the same for doing the same job.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I believe that it is wrong not to account for funds used for general expenditure. Those funds must also be calculated.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Another sensitive topic is our working place in Brussels and Strasbourg. This and how you will vote are matters for your wisdom. I believe that the Constitution is right to state that there are two places for the European Parliament to work. As early as 1952 Jean Monnet said that we want to unite people, not states. The European Parliament is the House in which we work and through which the citizens of Europe may be united. They will only be united if we are open to one another, if we work transparently and ensure the correct utilisation and planning of the European budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start, much like Mr Wynn, by thanking the secretariats of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the PPE-DE Group and my colleagues for helping to push through this report. I would now like to raise five points in five minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first point is that the aim of all these reports we are pushing through in the Committee on Budgetary Control is to improve the control environment. Having worked in a national administration myself, I can honestly say that I do not think that the control environment in any national administration is as strict and as tough as that which we have in the European Parliament or in the European Union in general. For example, I could easily find out what kind of wine Commissioner Kallas was drinking at a luncheon on 12 December: that is how much detail we can go into! I therefore find it a little sad that some people in this House are trying to use this report for populist means and are trying to dig up all the dirt. We tried to dig up all the dirt we possibly could and fortunately we did not find very much.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second point is that the report that I was pushing through dealt with six other ‘institutions’: the Council, the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman. They all passed with flying colours. I would nevertheless like to make two remarks, the first concerning the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the first time, we had a structured dialogue with the Council in an informal setting and it worked out quite well. We obtained the information we needed and we can be thankful for that. However, I have a slight word of warning for the future: we are getting to a stage in European integration where external relations, especially the common foreign and security policy, are getting more important. This means that, in future, the CFSP budget of the Council will not only be administrative but also executive. It will be particularly important for us to have a very close look at that when we start building the external relations service, to see how we can control it a little bit better.</p>
      <p sl="en">My other comment about the institutions relates to the Court of Auditors. A specific personnel case was dealt with there. My approach, and I think the approach of all the major groupings in the House, was not to humiliate the person in question and we wanted, therefore, to keep a low profile on it. We had a very good dialogue with the institution in question and the compromise we have put on the table hopefully satisfies all parties involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">My third point is that we had a very good dialogue with all the institutions. We obtained the information we needed and it worked out in many ways, but there is one thing I would particularly like to improve on and that is the timing of the report. The Court of Auditors came out with the report five minutes before our committee meeting and then we were supposed to have a discussion on it. It simply does not work. The President of the Court of Auditors comes and gives a 45-minute written statement and it is not necessarily the best way to start the dialogue, so perhaps we could improve on that just a little bit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming to my final two points, the first is that the discussion we had in committee was very constructive and the report as such passed with flying colours. There are not many amendments to the particular report I presented, only three in fact. As rapporteur, I would like to reject them. I do not think that they reflect the discussion we had in the group.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, there should be a fairly good agreement amongst the biggest groups in Parliament on adopting this report. Once again, I would like to thank all those involved in pushing it through.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I agree with my colleague Mr Wynn that this year has been truly exciting. We have had immense communication, both with the Commission and, in particular, with the directors of the agencies, who have provided us with all the necessary information throughout the procedure, and also with the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="es">The creation of the agencies, which right now are carrying out a series of important actions, such as the regulation or implementation of certain actions or promotion, lead us to ask the question whether there are too many of them or whether there are too many different models for them and whether they are all necessary, although Parliament has been involved in many of them, particularly in terms of demand.</p>
      <p sl="es">In some ways, this decentralisation of Community actions via its agencies is extremely positive, in that it gives the European Union accessibility, proximity and visibility in the Member States, and also, therefore, better knowledge of its citizens and, in this regard, we propose that the global communication strategy for these agencies be enhanced, and there is also greater speed and capacity for manoeuvre. But we must also acknowledge that there are enormous risks, in the sense that decentralisation may lead to a reduction in the control of budgetary execution or an overlapping of activities with those of the Commission or times when there is a lack of coordination or when national interests are put before the Community interest.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why our report calls for specific and in-depth reports from the Commission and a series of proposals and common guidelines to prevent these risks. And we would like these common guidelines to be reflected in the Interinstitutional Agreement and not just to refer to the mechanisms for strengthening control and budgetary responsibility in the execution of budgets, but also to everything affecting the harmonisation of its staff and the application of all the Community rules relating to its staff.</p>
      <p sl="es">We would also like the Commission to carry out an examination and assessment of the structure in particular, since the regulations are already being reviewed, particularly in view of the European added value of these agencies, in other words essentially their need for European action.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the Court of Auditors, we have also raised the need for greater coordination to increase transparency in the contradictory procedure prior to its report, because we have found that in the application of the timetable there had been problems at certain times which prevented Parliament from knowing exactly whether or not – and in this case at what point – the problems that had been noted had been improved and whether, in the relationship between the Court and the agencies or the Commission, a positive conclusion had been reached. All of this, of course, depends on a positive statement of assurance.</p>

    <intervention id="2-015" speaker_id="28139" name="Carl SCHLYTER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Sweden" birth_date="07-01-1968" birth_place="Danderyd" p_group="Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance" m_state="SE">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I wish firstly to thank everyone involved for the work they have helped us with and the desire for cooperation that has existed among the bodies concerned.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Discharge is not only an issue concerning the correct use of money. It is also about the way in which the objectives of the programmes are achieved and about the way in which efficiency in general is to be obtained. I therefore wish to emphasise the aspect of gender equality. We have an obligation to achieve the goals we have set in terms of equality. I have to say that it is a scandal that only half of the agencies have plans regarding equality. That is something they must correct before next year. Otherwise, I shall not be giving them discharge.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The reforms will proceed more quickly if we introduce thoroughgoing gender equality. Old hierarchical and patriarchal decision-making systems and working methods will be broken down. In the case of almost all organisations, four fifths of the people at the top are at present men and four fifths or more in the lowest positions are women. I have to say that we in the European Parliament are no better. What is more, we now have a situation in many countries in which more women than men embark upon university studies. There needs to be a sound recruiting basis for the purpose of changing the employment situation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another issue I wish to address is that of the European Agency for Reconstruction. As is well known, it was one of this agency’s officials that was suspected of helping a company purchase energy infrastructure. This is an example of how a scandal should, in actual fact, be dealt with. The director immediately suspended the official and lost no time in passing the document concerned on to OLAF, which began its investigation quickly and had completed it within ten months. The legal authorities were given the information, and it was possible for the proceedings to begin quickly. Now, we are also waiting for the Commission to complete the disciplinary procedure. If we could deal with scandals in this way and stop keeping things secret or trying to conceal them, our institutions would operate better. This shows how important public scrutiny is. However efficient the Court of Auditors may be, it can never discover everything. If, however, we were to have a principle of transparency, we should have 450 million inhabitants able to monitor what everyone did. That is the best method of preventing fraud and corruption.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I too should like to start by taking my turn to thank our general rapporteur, Terry Wynn, all my honourable friends on the Committee on Budgetary Control and the committee secretariat for their cooperation and support during the preparation of this report.</p>
      <p sl="el">Development policy is an essential component of the European Union's external action. It is a policy which we all hope will efficiently target the eradication of poverty and the bolstering of social infrastructures, education, health and the local development of the countries which we want to support in their efforts to achieve progress and social prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Development Fund is an important tool for carrying out this policy in the ACP countries. However, it needs to be made more effective through a greater focus on actions aimed at poverty eradication and through better and faster implementation.</p>
      <p sl="el">According to the Court of Auditors' statement of assurance, the accounts reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure relating to the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds, which is what we are examining today. The Court of Auditors points out certain problems, mainly in relation to use of the Stabex funds, the funds transferred to the European Investment Bank and not utilised and the amounts payable to the European Development Funds and not included in the balance sheet at 31 December 2003. The European Commission should step up its efforts to address the weaknesses identified in supervisory systems and controls.</p>
      <p sl="el">One issue which also attracted a great deal of our attention was the responsibilities of the Commissioners and, more importantly, the confusion between the responsibilities of the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, who is responsible for the policy of the European Development Fund, and the Commissioner for External Relations, who is responsible for the functioning of EuropeAide. During discussions with Commissioner Michel, who also wrote to us and we thank him for that, he assured us that there would be coordinated cooperation in the Commission on this issue. We thank him for their efforts but, as the Committee on Budgetary Control and as the European Parliament, we shall continue to monitor this issue, so that there are no problems in the future.</p>
      <p sl="el">Another issue to which particular attention needs to be paid concerns the RAL. A detailed study is needed on the part of the European Commission into the origin of this high level of unspent resources, together with a method to speed up the implementation of these resources, which will also result in the improved implementation of the European Development Fund overall.</p>
      <p sl="el">The decentralisation of resources to the Commission's representations, which was an ambitious plan and is at the completion stage, is moving in a positive direction and we are optimistic. However, we want an assurance that this procedure, which is under way, will also be accompanied by commensurate controls. This is another issue that we shall continue to monitor with a great deal of interest in the immediate future.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as far as the integration of the European Development Fund into the Community budget is concerned, the European Parliament has also discussed this issue in the past. The view taken by Parliament is that budgetisation will remove the complications which we presently encounter with the implementation of the European Development Fund and will contribute to better financial management and transparency. However, as the issue of the budgetisation of the EDF is a broader issue which touches on the debate on the new financial perspectives, we reserve Parliament's right to take a final stand on this issue when we take a stand on the new financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="el">With these general comments and taking account of the Court of Auditors' report, I should like to recommend that you give discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds for the financial year 2003.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the quality of the dialogue for this discharge procedure has been excellent. My fellow Commissioners and I were very happy to participate and I warmly thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Fazakas, for the kind and efficient way he led the proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the resolution adopted in the Committee on Budgetary Control, its broad support for the Commission’s efforts and achievements and its very constructive approach. It deals with the core political issue of the Statement of Assurance – DAS.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Commission, I congratulate you once more, Mr Wynn, for having contributed so well to bringing so much progress on the Statement of Assurance in so short a time. You, and the Court of Auditors with its opinion on the ‘Single Audit’, have served an excellent first service. The ball is now in our court and, together with the Council, we will try to return it with both speed and precision. Fortunately, contrary to tennis, this is a game where everybody wins. Indeed, we all win if the four relevant institutions – the Commission, the Council, the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament – are able to agree on a roadmap towards a positive DAS in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The key element in the roadmap, as in the resolution you are adopting today, will be how Member States can provide reasonable assurance to the Commission that adequate supervisory and control systems are in place. The Commission will present a proposal for a roadmap to a positive DAS before July 2005. I hope and expect that the United Kingdom’s presidency will pick up the proposals and lead trialogue negotiations towards an Interinstitutional Agreement in the autumn. Time presses, as legal changes may be needed, both in the legislative package of the new Financial Perspective and in the Financial Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mobilising and motivating the Member States will not be easy and the Commission continues to need your support. We can demonstrate that we are doing our part and are prepared to do it better. For instance, the Commission’s accounting system has been successfully converted and is now fully operational. In addition to this, the previous Commission achieved a great deal through its administrative reform and the Committee on Budgetary Control’s resolution is a welcome recognition of this. However, our roadmap will announce further steps the Commission will take to strengthen the Community control framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy to inform you that our roadmap has strong links with another initiative, the ‘transparency’ initiative, the purpose of which is to make more data about EU finances available to a wider section of the Union’s population.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not comment on the sectoral sections of the Committee on Budgetary Control’s resolution, although I am prepared to respond to any particular questions you may wish to raise. Nonetheless, I would like to add a few words on the four amendments to the Committee on Budgetary Control’s resolution to be put to your vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I would welcome your support for the amendments proposed by Mr Casaca to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. Indeed, the Court of Auditors’ statement that outstanding commitments for the Structural Funds represented ‘five years’ worth’ of spending is misleading, since the Court included commitments to be made until 2006 under the seven-year programming of the Structural Funds. The outstanding commitments were, in fact, less than two and a half years’ spending. This is normal, as spending is intended to continue up to the end of 2008 and the final payment is due in 2010. It is therefore incorrect to conclude that the programme was not well managed or that funds will remain unused. I hope you will be able to correct this important point today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to comment briefly on the amendment relating to the role of the accounting officer. What is my answer today? Firstly, that we will take this very seriously. I have had numerous meetings at different levels and with various well-known critics of the Commission’s accounting system. We consider this a very important issue and one of the key elements in our roadmap.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are studying the implication of the proposal for the accountant to sign off the accounts. We welcome the fact that Parliament has raised this issue and we will come back with specific proposals. You are right: there are supporters and opponents of the views presented in Parliament’s amendment. In my view, there are many questions of this kind where we can say that the matter lies in the details or beyond the details. The main question, in my view, is how to guarantee the right balance between policy-making and financial or fiscal management. Contradictions arise here between the view that the units and directorates-general are responsible for policy-making and the concern that this approach should be balanced so that the financial management will support this policy-making and not interfere with it. It is clear to me, therefore, that this would be one of the most important points and I promise that we do not underestimate this issue but take it very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would now like to add a few words on the specific discharges related to the European Development Fund – EDF – and the Agencies. As regards the EDF, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Xenogiannakopoulou, for a good report and for her open and constructive attitude during the discharge procedure. The Commission was, of course, pleased that the Court was able to give a positive DAS for the EDF.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report contains recommendations on many important issues. The Commission will follow up these recommendations in the months to come, but I can say already that we are in agreement on the main issues. We will, of course, keep Parliament informed on developments relating to the new accounting system, budgetary support and devolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me thank Parliament once more for its support for the Commission’s proposal to budgetise the EDF. We believe this is a one-off opportunity to achieve better, simpler and more efficient implementation of the EDF, which will be of great benefit for the ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the Agencies, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Ayala Sender and Mr Schlyter. The Agencies are autonomous bodies and it is the directors of the Agencies, not the Commission, that receive discharge from the European Parliament. However, since all the 14 Agencies concerned by the 2003 discharge receive grants charged to the general budget, the Commission notes with satisfaction that Parliament proposes to give discharge to the directors of all 14 Agencies for the financial year 2003.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to do its utmost to provide all necessary assistance to the Agencies in the future, in particular as regards budgetary, financial and accounting issues. Moreover, within its area of responsibility, the Commission will follow up the requests addressed to it by Parliament in the discharge resolutions for the Agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will conclude by encouraging Parliament to support the Committee on Budgetary Control’s proposals. I can assure you that the Commission will forward the recommendations upon which you will decide. Finally, it is a unique opportunity for all institutions to go ahead with creating more trust in European institutions. We must escape from under the shadow of suspicions, the shadow of the collapse of a certain Commission several years ago, and reassure citizens that we deal with all matters, including wrongdoing, in the proper way, so that we can create for the European institutions a reputation for reliability.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. In evaluating the utilisation of the general budget for 2003, it can be said that much effort has been made in terms of the implementation of development policy, in particular in striving for the Millennium Development Goals. The European Commission has improved its accounting system and has established ten basic indicators to evaluate the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We believe, however, that the Commission is not giving enough attention or support to the European Union candidate countries, which became Members ill-prepared to implement the European Union's development policy. This shortfall must be eliminated, by devoting attention and resources to education about development in the new Member States and by encouraging old and new Members to exchange experiences.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As the next stage of expansion nears with Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia preparing to become EU Members, it is necessary to pay proper attention to development policy obligations. When evaluating the implementation of the budget of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds for 2003, it must be stressed that the Commission did not manage to introduce suitable procedures for evaluating Community aid. The decentralisation of the Commission's representatives in Western countries is not supported by organisational means, it remains necessary to improve management and decision-making efficiency control. The way budget aid is rendered facilitates the work of the Commission, but in the absence of a suitable control mechanism, does not realistically encourage the governments of the countries receiving aid to be accountable to their citizens and this allows the implementation of an uncoordinated development policy. For example, the exhaustion of natural resources through deforestation driven by consumer demand.</p>
      <p sl="lt">With the new financial outlook the ‘budgetisation’ of the European Development Fund would only facilitate aid management, however like budget aid, this in itself would not guarantee aid efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Thus effort is required to further improve management and control instruments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is not happy, but largely satisfied with the implementation of the 2003 budget in the sphere of the environment, public health and food safety. While noting the Commission’s intention to improve the implementation cycle of multi-annual programmes, we do want it to target its invitations to tender more and to give applicants rather more intensive support.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission must, however, stop justifying dilatory implementation by reference to the new administrative and financial provisions. It is a defence that we will no longer accept in future. We believe that the European Environment Agency, the Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and the Food Safety Authority have worked well and intelligently, and we expect more of the same in future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would first of all like to express my pleasure at the progress that was made in 2003 in the implementation of the budget in the area of freedom, security and justice, even though the payment implementation level was still much too low. I would, however, like to draw attention to the remarks made by the Court of Auditors concerning the use of European Refugee Fund credits.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More generally, I would like to stress that the development of shared management between the Commission and the Member States in budget matters will require the latter to make serious additional efforts. In this respect, I agree with our rapporteur, Mr Wynn, when he writes in paragraph 104 of his report that the European Parliament deplores the failure of some Member States to control and manage taxpayers' money for which they are responsible, and points to the hypocrisy of some Member States in blaming the Commission for failing to control expenditure for which those Member States are responsible.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I am going to speak on the general report and I shall start by offering my compliments to Commissioner Kallas for the correct way he has set about doing his job, both as regards his responsibility as well as for the way he collaborates with us in the European Parliament. However I would like to inform the Commissioner from the start, that this year we are perhaps being too soft in his regard also because this is his first year in office and it is difficult to blame him for something which was done by his predecessors. In the general budget report, we are making a favourable recommendation. This does not mean that we are satisfied about everything. On the contrary. We think that there is still much more to do in order to have stricter controls in the budget of the European Union. After all, here, we are not talking about funds which have fallen down from the sky but about funds which come from people's taxes. In this year’s general report we are saying that the DAS system should be reformed so that it would no longer remain a frustrating target that can never be reached. But we are also making a strong emphasis on the controls being made not so much at a European level but at a national level.</p>
      <p sl="mt">There is the need for national authorities to give a more detailed account of how the funds of the European Union are being spent, when these are spent in different countries or in different regions. I am much afraid that when making use of the European Union’s funds, the governments are not being serious enough in the controls that they are carrying out. It is not right that while the national authorities take great care when spending national financial resources, they do not take equally great care when they spend money passed on to them by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="mt">National authorities should therefore realise that if they will not introduce the necessary controls they will be risking losing the funds. On our part we are making a series of clear and detailed recommendations in our report to ensure that the money which is spent at national level is spent in a serious way and with all the necessary controls. We are also reminding the Commission that even when European funds are spent by national authorities, it still cannot shirk all responsibility. After all, it is the Commission that is still responsible for the budget. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I would like to use the short time allocated to me by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control to thank the rapporteur and all the members of the Committee and its secretariat for their unstinting hard work, the result of which we are now able to debate.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The present discharge procedure differs from earlier ones in two respects. On the one hand this is the first occasion where representatives of the new Member States were able to participate actively in the work and were thus able to get firsthand experience in one of the European Parliament’s most important activities. I mean this not only from an accounting point of view, but also in terms of the politics affecting Europe’s current and future operation. The other, even more important change, is that this year, building on the experience and renown of the rapporteur Terence Wynn, we reformed the procedure itself, doing away with the earlier written question-and-response format and instead generating direct dialogue with the Commission, the relevant institutions and the European Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We were pleased to find that this reform was positively received by all parties concerned. We both came to the conclusion that through such a reform, the discharge procedure would no longer be viewed as something of a nightmare, but as a joint task for Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors with the aim of ensuring that the EU operates better, more efficiently and more transparently in the eyes of the public. I would especially like to thank Commissioner Siim Kallas, who is here today, and Mr Hubert Weber, President of the European Court of Auditors, for their contribution to our work, and I look forward to working with them again in the future in this important field.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteurs, more specifically Mr Wynn and Mrs Juknevičienė from our group. I think it must have been a particular delight for Mr Wynn to be a rapporteur for the discharge after having been on the Committee on Budgets for so many years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Although we have a new Commission and we cannot hold this Commission responsible for the events in 2003, we still need to learn from everything that has happened during that year. Given that the most striking thing is that there is once again no positive Statement of Assurance (DAS), I welcome the Commissioner’s statement this morning that he intends to present us, by July this year, with a proposal for a roadmap of some kind towards a positive DAS, which is of crucial importance. It is also essential to have in-depth discussions with the Court of Auditors in order to establish in what way we can get one, because it is unacceptable for the Court of Auditors to keep changing the rules of the game throughout the whole period. We have to know how a positive DAS can be achieved. Public opinion demands that we join with this new Commission and this new Commissioner in order finally to achieve a positive DAS.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The responsibility lies with the Member States. One of the paragraphs in the resolution stipulating that in the Member States, the person with the highest political responsibility must stand surety for European money being spent wisely, represents an important new departure in the entire discussion with the Member States. As the Council of Finance Ministers set great store, in any case, by economic policy and related matters, I hope they will adopt it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One final word for my colleague, Mrs Juknevičienė. It is very admirable that someone from a new Member State should draft such a thorough report. I hope that the amendments will be adopted.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will confine my speech to the discharge of the European Parliament, as other colleagues will be dealing with the other reports. We should be able to say it here too: Parliament’s budget is in good shape. Enormous efforts are being made by our Administration under the leadership of Secretary-General Priestley to manage Parliament’s budget correctly, and they deserve our appreciation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should nevertheless like to mention two bottlenecks, namely the fact that we are operating from three locations and the voluntary pension fund. Our working from three locations, namely Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, is in fact required of us by the EU Treaty. That is already costing us, as taxpayers, more than EUR 200 million a year. Apart from the money aspect, there is also the time factor, which we can no longer justify to our electorate. During previous discharge procedures, we asked the Convention to delete this article in the Treaty from the Constitution, but without success. We, the new Parliament, should therefore make it quite clear that we disapprove of this situation and can no longer accept it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should also like to draw your attention to the paragraphs in the report on the European Parliament’s discharge relating to the voluntary pension fund. There is obviously ambiguity surrounding the responsibility of this House and the participants in this voluntary pension fund. As long as nearly ten years ago, Parliament made up a shortfall of EUR 9 million. Although it was decided then that a clear line should be drawn between this voluntary pension fund and the European Parliament’s official bodies, a twilight area continued to exist. This pension fund is going from bad to worse. There is already a shortage to the tune of EUR 42 million. We should therefore stress that the European budget, this Parliament’s budget, should not under any circumstances be used to plug this hole. It would be unethical and irresponsible. Taxpayers’ money may not be used to fill a deficit of EUR 42 million in a voluntary pension fund. I thank you for your attention and hope, above all, that we can, when we vote, ensure that these arrangements are in place.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Mr Wynn has done a brilliant job, as has, for example, his fellow rapporteur Mr Schlyter.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our parliamentary monitoring system is inadequate, however. The EU has very little standing and legitimacy in the eyes of Europeans, and understandably so. The key words that come to mind in the case of an ordinary European are control from the top, Establishment thinking, waste and corruption. Why are things that way? Evidently, institutional control via the Court of Auditors, OLAF and the Committee on Budgetary Control is not enough. It is not working. Our system continues to be full of irregularities and corruption. Nor, evidently, do freedom of expression, democratic debate, investigative journalism and other such external controls operate. They are not enough. What is required? What, also, are required are what we usually call whistle blowers. Throughout the EU’s machinery and in all bodies and at all levels, officials are required who are loyal not to their superiors but to European citizens and taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have had well-known whistle blowers, discussed all over the world: van Buitenen, Mart Andreasen, Hans-Peter Martin etc. The list is long. What has happened to those who have revealed fraud in the system and directed attention to it? Normally, they have lost their jobs. Now, we have another example of a case like this in the Committee of the Regions. I would therefore request Parliament to support our Amendment 2 to Title VII, paragraph 12, tabled by Mr Titford, Mr Bonde and myself. All this must be put a stop to.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, we have here a number of very thorough and very perceptive reports for which I would like to thank the rapporteurs, notwithstanding the fact that in a number of cases I can only express wonder that, after such striking and precise criticism of entirely unacceptable states of affairs, they end by recommending discharge – in other words, release from liability for the administration.</p>
      <p sl="da">I must emphasise that it is not of course Mr Kallas’s fault. We are talking about something that happened in the past, before this Commission. The fact that we are holding others responsible for the past actually distances us somewhat from the matter.</p>
      <p sl="da">Mr Wynn writes that he finds it disappointing that the Court of Auditors ‘has no reasonable assurance that the supervisory systems and controls of significant areas of the budget are effectively implemented so as to manage the risks concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying operations’. In other words, we again have no positive Statement of Assurance. We have discussed this problem time and time again over the years. We know all too well that there are many different countries with different administrative cultures, but, when it comes down to it, the problems are due to the fact that the legislation drawn up is inappropriate and often does not even achieve the specified aims. On the contrary, the procedure is based on a method that encourages fraud and evasion, and the failure to comply with the budget is in many areas an expression of the fact that the intended policy is not being implemented.</p>
      <p sl="da">Moreover, we still do not have a modern, acceptable accounting system in a number of areas – that was what Mrs Andreasen was fired for pointing out some time ago – and the conditions for this are still not in place.</p>
      <p sl="da">When I read the report, I could not help but think of the libretto of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s opera Evita, which is about Evita Peron, wife of the deceased Argentinean president, General Peron. Talking about a charitable foundation she had established, the lyrics say: ‘A little of the cash has gone astray’. It is a bit like that in the EU. The opera’s lyrics also include the words: ‘When the money keeps rolling out, you don’t keep books’. That was in Argentina in the 1950s, but now it is the EU in 2005. It would never be acceptable in the national states, and it ought not to be acceptable here, either. That is why I am going to vote against the budgetary discharge in certain cases, but in favour of a number of the very sensible amendments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, please allow me to concentrate in this debate on the issues relating to this House and to start by yet again pointing out how dire are the consequences of the gentlemen’s agreement between the Council and Parliament not to check up on each other, in that we see in this House a constant striving for ‘more’. That is apparent when we look back at 2003, but particularly so when we look into the future. I find it very regrettable that Mrs Juknevičienė’s report was further diluted in committee; we have less control over travel expenses than we otherwise might, and we are being presented with new openings as regards pension provision and the gold-plated supplementary pensions for MEPs. In the form of the Liberal Group’s important amendments, an attempt is now being made to curb that, but these deal only with the formalities involved in paying these pensions rather than with the scandal that the system represents.</p>
      <p sl="de">Rather than at last learning something from the situation in which we find ourselves, we again, yesterday, had the spooky experience of the Committee on Budgets discussing what we are going to do with the EUR 90 million to which this House will have access in 2006, with nobody being quite sure what the money is going to be spent on. Although someone resurrected the idea of setting up a television channel for broadcasting this House’s debates, the best way of investing these EUR 90 million in an information campaign would be to give it all back to the taxpayers. That way, we would be sure of favourable coverage, and no more of these resources would need to be wasted.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to greet Terry Wynn and congratulate him on the excellent work he has done on his report. He has demonstrated his experience and he has used it to ensure that our Committee could work much better this time than in previous years. I agree with him that it is scandalous to hear once again from the Court of Auditors that the accounts of our institution, of the European Union, are not reliable. This is a procedural problem and all of us here agree that the system must be changed so that we may finally see the Holy Grail; a positive discharge of our accounts. There is a fundamental problem: the immense number of controls that make spending inefficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Alexander Stubb, who has had control responsibilities in Finland, as I have in Spain, has said, there are greater controls in the European Union than there are in the Member States or in other institutions. And inevitably ever greater controls only mean that spending is less efficient, that opportunities are missed, that officials do not want to take any responsibility and efficiency is reduced. We shall have to see how much control we want. The public interest does not necessarily benefit because cars travel at 20 km per hour in order to prevent accidents. We shall therefore have to see how we can promote initiative and put more thought into efficiency than into controls.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the report on the accounts of the European Parliament, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and I would like to say that we Members of the European Parliament effectively have hardly any say over our Statute. We cannot decide where we want to meet nor where we do not want to meet. We are hostages to the decisions of the Council, and it is now time for it to take them. But there is no question that, until it does so, it is better not to touch anything and to leave things as they are.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need a Statute providing for the same fiscal treatment for everybody, and we must not forget that this argument is a substantial element of our Statute and is the way forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Ona Juknevičienė, for her excellent work on Parliament’s discharge, which is an important one. The rapporteur pointed out that the report has been the subject of lively debate in the ALDE Group. I can say that the same applies to my own Group. If these discussions prove anything it is the need for a single Members’ Statute, which would solve many of the problems discussed in this discharge. Therefore I call on the Council to reach a compromise. Parliament has already done so.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to focus attention on two separate issues. Firstly, the amendments concerning the voluntary pension fund and in particular the estimated deficit have led to much discussion among my colleagues. The majority of my Group has decided not to support the extra amendments put forward, but instead to support the critical text already in the report. I, however, support these amendments, as will the rest of my delegation. Again, I ask my colleagues to do the same.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue is the need for a single working place for this House. In my view this issue reaches to the core of Parliament’s credibility. The amount of public funds spent annually on this dispersion to multiple working places is immense and the general public neither understands nor supports this inefficient way of working. I believe that we need a single seat. I also believe that Brussels would be the most logical choice as the other institutions are already based there. However, I recognise the historic value of Strasbourg and I understand the value of this Parliament to the city. Therefore I call on the Council and the Commission to offer the city a high-level alternative for the future, on which I have some ideas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commission President Barroso has expressed ideas on the need for a European institute for technology as a part of the Lisbon Agenda. I support that idea and this building would be perfect for a high-level university and technological research centre where Europe’s best and brightest could be assembled for the ambitious future of this Union, instead of its troubled past. Therefore I call on this House to support the amendments. I call on the Council to take them seriously and solve this issue once and for all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Parliament grows in authority, but allows its reputation and that of its Members to be dragged through the mire by its failure to ensure that arrangements are put in place for the payment of expenses and allowances that are of a kind that would be expected in any private business. I recognise that some of the problems in securing reform come from the unjust arrangements for the payment of Members’ salaries, but that cannot excuse the fact that at this time there are no arrangements in place for the auditing of Members’ general expenditure allowances. As things stand, it is possible for those who belong to the voluntary pension funds to allow their private contributions to be met out of public funds, without making reimbursement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a practice, if it occurs, would be wholly indefensible. It would amount to embezzlement of public funds. All of us are tarnished by the suggestion – and perhaps the reality – of such practices. We should today take the opportunity to vote for reform and transparency. We should take the initiative and ensure that this House sets high standards for the whole of Europe. We should not wait for changes to be forced upon us by the pressure of public scandal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Commission’s Internal Auditor does not know whether the accounts are complete or correct. The accounting system does not automatically include all the facts and figures. The Internal Auditor’s department literally says that interested parties do not know whether the Commission’s figures reflect reality. Parliament has not gained any access to the important information required if it is to give discharge; there was only a summary of the original report by the former Internal Auditor, Jules Muis. Mr Muis left the Commission on 1 April 2004. His recommendations fell on deaf ears. Even the chef de cabinet warned Mr Muis, telling him: ‘We know how to break people like you’. The final report by the Internal Audit Service on Eurostat was made available to only three Members of this House for their inspection; as only one of them was re-elected, only one Member has access now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Committee on Budgetary Control does not accept this revenue and expenditure account, because the figures have not been signed off by the person responsible for doing so. In any other business, this would mean that this revenue and expenditure account could not be used as a basis for a discharge. Mr Wynn was right in identifying this shortcoming and we, as representatives of the people, now have the duty to postpone the grant of discharge until such time as the person responsible has summoned up the nerve to add his signature. The person responsible for this in 2002, Mrs Andreasen, has just filed a petition to Parliament on this very subject. Although her petition is admissible, Parliament has so far refused to hear her. The Court of Auditors is equally doubtful of the effect of the controls within the Commission’s accounting system and of the legitimacy of expenditure for each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My endorsement of Mr Stubb’s report will depend on whether the amendments of the Independence and Democracy Group with regard to the Committee on the Regions are adopted. The former Internal Auditor and now unfortunately whistleblower, Robert McCoy, did his duty as auditor, but was destroyed. He did not fall to his knees before Parliament, which was a condition for discharge. In addition, in one of the amendments tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group, it is stated, and rightly, that OLAF failed to submit its enquiry report to the Belgian courts. Once again, the whistleblower was prevented from giving his side of the story in the Committee on Budgetary Control.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control has attempted not only to brush under the carpet serious allegations of financial discrepancies at the Committee of the Regions, but also to wash its hands, like Pontius Pilate, over yet another whistleblower left to face appalling and unjust treatment for being brave enough to tell the truth. It beggars belief that Mr Stubb could have drawn up any report, let alone one of such a sensitive nature, without making sure he interviewed all the key players. Yet it seems he could not, or would not, see the Committee of the Regions’ former Internal Auditor.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the back of this shocking disregard, it is little surprise that Mr Stubb’s report contains so many howlers. The original draft claimed that the then Internal Auditor had not been subject to an internal inquiry, when the Committee of the Regions’ Secretary-General had admitted in writing that he had been. Mr Stubb claims that: ‘ … none of the officials who were the subject of the administrative inquiry has been promoted since the completion of the report’. However, he omits to mention that several of them were allegedly put forward for promotion. Most nauseatingly, the report states that the former Internal Auditor was assured that he had ‘the full support and cooperation of both CoR members and staff’. That man has since been locked out of his office and hounded out of his job for telling the truth. Mr Stubb’s report is rotten to the core, just like the EU institutions it represents.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control on which I sit does not budget in any meaningful sense and shows very little control. I would just like to remind this House of some of the fundamentals. The European Union’s income comes in an endless stream: percentages of VAT, customs duty and GDP from the Member States. There is no means of stopping this flood of cash and no means of returning it either. If this were an elected government as opposed to a bureaucracy, the very use of this vast sum of money, let alone its distribution, would be far more critically analysed, and accountable democracy demands that surpluses be refunded by the reduction in taxation.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the Court of Auditors, the EU has lost some EUR 600 billion over the time since the UK joined, which is more than four times the total net contribution my country has made to this place. Nothing will adequately deal with these problems until and unless the Member States themselves independently set up a genuinely separate, full auditing procedure over the management of all EU funds. The Member States are the paymasters.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteurs, because they have done a careful and systematic job, taking account of the positions and comments of the members of our committee, which has resulted in a broadly acceptable text. The competent parliamentary committee therefore proposes discharge for all the agencies. However, the comments it has formulated require examination, because they will be useful for the policy of the European Commission in respect of these agencies and to the agencies themselves in their daily management.</p>
      <p sl="el">We all agree that the agencies must have suitable financial resources, so that they can function, and that their objective must be transparency, efficiency and added value to the work of the central institutions of the European Union. That is why the Committee on Budgetary Control, apart from specific comments on certain agencies, expressed its views on a framework of management rules based on common, harmonised guidelines, which will emerge following substantive dialogue with the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="el">We believe that it would be exceptionally useful if a more careful study were carried out of synergies between the actions of certain agencies and the action of certain sections or directorates of the European Commission. We believe there should be better communication and cooperation, so that, instead of overlapping objectives and work, we have complementarity and enhanced European added value.</p>
      <p sl="el">We agree with the rapporteurs' views that, in certain agencies, there needs to be better utilisation of human resources, together with systematic information on the need to apply equality in the agencies. They must set an example for our action and policies on gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as they are decentralised, the agencies have an excellent opportunity to get close to the citizens and their actions must also be visible in the Member States in which they are established.</p>

I also wish to mention our colleagues Mrs Ayala Sender and Mrs Xenogiannakopoulou who, along with our chairman Mr Fazakas, have formed a team in which the socialists have come to the fore and can have great pride in their work.</p>

I must say to you, however, that I am not particularly interested to know which wine you drank on 12 December, based on a note presented by Mr Stubb, but I am certainly very interested to know which companies were funded by export subsidies and pastry subsidies from the Community budget to dispose of 30 000 tonnes of adulterated butter. The problem is that, after six years, the Commission still tells me that it cannot disclose such confidential data, and that Members of Parliament and the European public do not have access to this information. This strikes me as the biggest problem that we face.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, most languages have proverbs to the effect that people should put their own houses in order before requiring others to do so.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is therefore important for us to get our benefits in order. Travel allowances are emphatically not there for the purpose of adjusting incomes. Rather, they are straightforward travel expenses that should be paid out on the basis of actual costs. If we want to adjust salaries, we need an extra budgetary item which is publicly accounted for. My colleague, Mr Staes, explained the problems involving the pension fund or supplementary pension. It should be self-funded, with the deficits covered by those who are in the scheme. It is unfair that taxpayers should shoulder the loss when share speculation goes wrong and that those who are in the scheme should take the profit in the event of successful speculation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our ordinary travel allowances are generous. People wishing to claim the full amount should account for how they have used it. Those who cannot do so should receive a lower refund. Certainly, it takes time to account for expenses, but it is time well spent if it leads to increased credibility for Parliament. In the election campaign, I discovered that the publicly available web site no longer contained information about the rules governing our benefits. Since it is not secret, this information should be published there immediately. This is an area subject to voters’ most frequent questions. I hope that the rapporteur’s Amendment 6 and the other amendments that strengthen the wording are supported.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, there is a lot I should like to emphasise in connection with the matter we are now to address, namely discharge for the 2003 budget. This includes shortcomings in the accounting system, the Member States’ unwillingness to claim back funds paid out in error, the European Development Fund and excessive travel allowances paid to MEPs. In view of the limited time I have to speak, I wish, however, to focus upon a smaller but, in terms of principle, important part of the EU budget, and one that is quite incomprehensible from our citizens’ point of view: the subsidies for tobacco cultivation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Every year, European taxpayers are forced to pay out close to SEK 10 billion in subsidies for tobacco cultivation. That is a terrible waste and a quite disgusting way of dealing with people’s tax money. To cap it all, the tobacco subsidised by the EU is of such very poor quality that no European manufacturers want to use it. Instead, this very same tobacco is used to drive tobacco manufacturers in poor countries out of business.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The subsidies for tobacco cultivation are no less bizarre in view of the fact that the Commission has now launched an anti-smoking campaign estimated to cost SEK 700 million. May I say that this is the height of hypocrisy. In debating the Commission’s discharge, Parliament can make it clear that tobacco subsidies must be abolished. With his casting vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the June List’s Mr Lundgren has, unfortunately, ensured that we now have a parliamentary situation in which the European Parliament is supposed to defend the most shameful agricultural subsidies. I appreciate the fact that Mr Lundgren stated publicly yesterday that he had made a mistake. The only problem is that the damage has already been done. It remains the case that, despite the fact that, before the elections for the European Parliament, the June List promised to work towards phasing out tobacco subsidies, the most abiding result to date of that self-same June List having been elected to Parliament is its having contributed to ensuring the very survival of the tobacco subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I hope and believe that, in plenary, Parliament will do everything it can to correct Mr Lundgren’s gaffe and vote in favour of an opinion stating that Parliament wants to see tobacco subsidies abolished.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wynn, the general rapporteur, has touched on something fundamental in the shape of the issue of the Member States’ share in responsibility. We know that, of the funds in the European Budget, some 80% flow out via the Member States. Another aspect I want to touch on here is one that has come to light in a report just published by the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="de">Between 1971 and September 2004, irregularities in the agricultural sector totalled some EUR 3.1 billion; 30 years on, some 20.2% have been collected from the recipients of funding, while 5% had to be borne by EAGGF, and EUR 144 million by the Member States. EUR 2.2 billion, equivalent to 70%, are still outstanding and will not be recovered. It follows from this that the Member States are quite simply paying too little attention to the European Budget and to the money that flows back to them via Europe. I am not entirely sure whether a statement by the finance ministers is the most appropriate way to deal with this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee on Budgetary Control, and this House too, have had some success in getting what is termed the n+2 rule introduced into the Structural Funds. The introduction of a similar rule for the recovery of funds will end up being inevitable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for the discharge reports that have been presented, which show that this House takes very seriously the scrutiny of whether the extensive funds, nearly 95% of which are disbursed in the form of subsidies – which itself shows what is problematic about the EU Budget – are actually properly utilised. I very much want to thank Mr Wynn, who has come up with a range of workable proposals, and I can do no other than urge you, Commissioner, to act on them. Your predecessor was a great one for announcing things, but when I see what she promised to implement as long ago as 2000 and set it against what you have to get through, Commissioner Kallas, what becomes clear to me is that there is still room for improvement here.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may take a very practical example, something had to be done about the accounting system even before Commissioner Schreyer took office, and it is to you that the honour now falls of actually doing it. I hope you will waste no time in doing so. The report gives good guidance as to how to go about it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The purpose of the discharge reports is not, however, to make statements on every conceivable problem. I am also addressing my fellow-Members in this group when I say that, where the Tobacco Regulation is concerned, our job is not to examine the legality or otherwise of paying bonuses, but rather whether they have all been paid in a lawful manner. Those are the ground rules, whether we like them or not.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to the discharge of this House, I do not know whether it is the greatest problem in the world whether people do or do not smoke in individual offices. It does not affect the Budget and must therefore be sorted out elsewhere, so let us concentrate on things that really do have to do with the budget and with money and its disappearance, things about which Mr Bösch has had something to say and where there is much to be done. The President is about to cut me off, so I will now finish by saying ‘thank you’ to the rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have three very brief points to make. Firstly, I agree entirely with the annual Statement of Assurance submitted by the Member States, given that this statement fully embodies the principle of shared management, already duly defined.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My second comment concerns own resources. I also agree with the observation made in Mr Wynn’s report on this matter, namely that the Commission should be concerned with the benchmarking criteria and national accounting calculations of each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My third and final observation concerns the issue of how to disclose any technical irregularities to the general public, thereby giving people the idea that irregularities and fraud do take place in the implementation of Community funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To conclude, I should like to make one final point. I endorse the implementation of the budget by the agencies, although I regret that no mention was made of the Maritime Safety Agency, and more specifically to the process of putting this agency in place.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I also wish to congratulate our rapporteurs, in particular Mr Wynn, on their reports on the budgetary discharges. I remember that the first one Mr Wynn produced in 1994, and my own in 1996, produced a different type of debate on discharges than the one we are having today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Undoubtedly, as Mr Wynn has indicated to us, should the recommendations of his report be accepted and implemented then we would see a significant step towards getting the Statement of Assurance – DAS – which most of us in this House want. This would give greater credibility to management of funds by European institutions. This means greater responsibilities will have to be taken by all concerned, including responsibilities for the Chief Accounting Officer to sign off the accounts. The Commissioner has shown that he wants to go that way, but I strongly urge that Amendment 4 be adopted. We need Commissioners to take individual responsibility for ensuring directorates-general effectively manage the funds under their responsibilities. We also need to ensure that whistleblowers are properly protected should they wish to come forward with information about the operation of Community policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Above all, we need implementation with regard to the issue of shared management that Marta Andreasen mentioned. Shared management is no management unless there is a proper internal control framework to ensure that monies are properly accounted for in Member States. That is why we as Conservatives strongly support the move towards the greater involvement of Member States in the way in which things should be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, we welcome very strongly the idea of having proposals by July, with a view to having an interinstitutional agreement by the end of this year. However, they are still just intentions and, therefore, Conservatives will be voting against discharge because, for the tenth year running, we note that there is no positive Statement of Assurance available.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to remind ourselves what a discharge is. A discharge must allow us to say that the European budget has been properly implemented and to guarantee the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the transactions. A discharge must also allow us to assess the progress made in implementing the recommendations contained in the previous discharge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must therefore express my surprise as to the substance and form of this report, especially the European Parliament section. I do not understand the highly disagreeable tone taken by the rapporteur and the authors of certain amendments concerning all the Members of this Institution. The list of criticisms in fact implies a kind of dishonesty, and I absolutely will not endorse it. I do not think you can heap opprobrium on the Members of the European Parliament in this way. I would like to add that it is inconceivable that we should change the current rules on allowances until we have a single Statute for Members of the European Parliament. Incidentally, is this discharge the right place to talk about the use of tobacco and cigarettes on our premises? It is totally off-subject, though I grant it is a real problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, and in particular, what can I say about the calling into question, once again, of the European Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg? May I first of all remind you that, contrary to what the report before us today says about it, Parliament is not competent in the matter. Apart from the 1992 Edinburgh European Council, which decided by unanimous vote of the Heads of State or Government that the European Parliament’s seat should be in Strasbourg for political reasons, that decision was also set forth in Protocol No 12 to the Treaty of Amsterdam so that it could be guaranteed by the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A year ago, a similar proposal was made to abolish Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg and transfer completely to Brussels, and the Members of the European Parliament in their great wisdom rejected that proposal in plenary session; moreover, the members of the Convention pointed this out when discussing the Constitutional Treaty. The opponents of Strasbourg must not be allowed to use the 2003 discharge to make a renewed attempt to change Parliament’s seat. This question is off-subject and outside our legal competence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was responsible for the Committee on Regional Development’s opinion on this discharge. The Court of Auditors gave a relatively clean bill of health to the internal organisation administration of the structural funds, but that was not the case in relation to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the fundamental problems we have with the whole system is that of shared responsibility. When the Member States fail, the Commission gets the blame. Until we sort out that issue we will not get very far. Therefore I suggested that we should not agree to sign the interinstitutional agreement until the Member States agree to sign annual statements of assurance. I am sorry that some of the other parties did not agree to pre-empt that situation in this report. I hope they will show more backbone when it comes to the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important that we have more preventive measures in order to stop fraud and mismanagement. It is essential that the Commission use the Court of Auditors a bit more in terms of giving opinion on the development of policy. Will the Commissioner give a commitment to ensure that, in future, there is a systematic policy of asking the Court of Auditors for its advice during the development of policy? There is a real opportunity now, in particular with the new seven-year programmes coming up.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank you all for these contributions and for the very constructive and good mood in which you are discussing what could be termed not so attractive issues. These issues become more unattractive when something is going wrong, and so if we can approach this work in a positive way then we will have a quiet and calm attitude.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say that we have a unique momentum. We have had good discussions with the Council. The Council has expressed its readiness to discuss these issues of shared responsibility, although it is too early to set out the details. We also had good discussions with the Court of Auditors. It too is ready to discuss all the methodology questions and the question of the reliability of ‘audit evidence’. The point is that if we propose some ideas by the summer, that does not mean that we will necessarily get a positive Statement of Assurance – DAS – this year, but at least we will manage do so within a short period of time. So the momentum is unique and I hope that we can propose adequate details and solutions to meet these expectations. I fully agree with what Mr Elles said. This is a very good approach today, a good attitude, but the details must also be expanded upon in an adequate manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also find responses to certain demands for simplification, because, being extremely concerned about serious financial control and about surveillance mechanisms, we have introduced enormous amounts of rules, documents and applications. As one honourable Member said, these enormous amounts of rules still do not mean we can fulfil the requirements of all documents in an absolutely legal and correct way. We still waste money and this serious control is still not there.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must fulfil programmes. We must implement decisions and we must not have long delays due to the enormous amount of documents and to the need to follow bureaucratic rules. So in parallel with the clear need – especially with regard to the discharge issue – to strengthen and clarify the control and surveillance systems, we must also seriously address the question of dynamism in decision-making, so as not to have a system in which control is impossible.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that we will meet soon to discuss possible proposals on how to achieve a more reliable and more transparent control and discharge system for the Community budget.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report by Glenys Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the role of the European Union in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) [2004/2252(INI)] (A6-0075/2005).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Millennium Declaration adopted by world leaders in 2000 represents an unprecedented declaration of solidarity. It is evidence that there is real determination to achieve the Millennium Development Goal targets, which would lift 500 million people out of extreme poverty, would save 30 million children who would otherwise die before their fifth birthday, and would save more than 2 million mothers who would otherwise not have survived pregnancy and childbirth. Hundreds of millions of women and girls would be educated, and millions would have access to clean water and sanitation. The world has the technologies, the policies and the financial resources to deliver the promise and vision of the MDGs.</p>
      <p sl="en">On aid, MDG8 highlights the need for substantial increases in ODA. Only four Member States have already reached the 0.7% target. Others have set timetables. Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Portugal, meanwhile, are all far off target. At the current rate, Germany will not reach its target until 2087. Italy, one of the world’s wealthiest countries and a G-8 member, gives only a miserly 0.17% of its GNI in aid. There has to be close monitoring of annual intermediate targets by EU finance ministers and foreign ministers. I should like to ask the Commissioner to respond to that part of our resolution. The financial perspective suggests that further squeezing of development spending by other categories, as well as within the external relations category, threatens the likelihood of us contributing as we should to meeting the MDG targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission must continue to work to improve the quality and effectiveness of our aid using the MDGs as the tool to guide our policies. Member States should collaborate and coordinate in a coherent way more than they do currently with the Commission, in order to tackle how aid can be best used to serve and fulfil the MDGs.</p>
      <p sl="en">On unsustainable debt, most EU Member States are committed to cancelling the bilateral debts of the world’s poorest countries. Again, I am afraid that Italy must be singled out and named and shamed as a country continuing to make progress at a snail’s pace on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">On trade, I totally agree and concur with the opinion presented by the Committee on International Trade, which covers a number of our concerns as far as the European Union’s role as the world’s biggest trading bloc is concerned: our role in dealing with access to markets, building capacity and other aspects of trade and trade liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union negotiates in a way that sometimes calls into question whether there is a clear enough understanding of the pro-development objectives that are referred to on so many occasions. This is true of both the WTO negotiations and the EPA negotiations where I can confirm that, as far as ACP countries are concerned, there is the sense of a need to feel that closer consultation has occurred and that there is greater understanding by DG Trade of the development aspects to which they give such high priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the common agricultural policy, Member States must urgently tackle the practices that depress world prices, distort poor-country markets and undermine earning opportunities for their farmers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the amendments on trade and agriculture policies, which we will vote on later, are in all cases inappropriate and, in a number of cases, propose totally unrealistic options.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, Parliament should reject Amendments 10 to 16, which reflect unacceptable conservative views on essential aspects of MDG targets. The supply of condoms for the treatment of sexually-transmitted diseases and access to safe and legal abortion must remain as clear priorities if the over-arching goal of poverty eradication is to be achieved. Five hundred and thirty thousand women died in pregnancy or childbirth last year. There were more than 3 million stillborn births. Four million infants did not survive their first year of life. We should support the real need to facilitate access to responsive post-abortion procedures. There is also a need to facilitate access to high-quality and safe services to the fullest extent provided and allowed for by the laws in the countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the WHO reported only yesterday, 78 000 deaths occur as a result of unsafe abortions. Millions of women in desperate need resort to unsafe induced abortion. I would contradict those people who believe that any woman takes the decision to terminate a pregnancy lightly, and say very firmly that it is not and never would be the case. She has the right to choose good-quality responsive abortion and post-abortion care under the law. A woman has the right to choose.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission of course warmly welcomes Mrs Kinnock’s report on the role of the European Union in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I would like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock and the Committee on Development on this report, which ought to stimulate discussion and negotiation on the measures required to achieve the MDGs.</p>

The European Union has on a number of occasions underlined that the review of the Millennium Goals at the United Nations summit in September 2005 will be crucial for accelerating progress towards the achievement of the MDGs. With a view to the European Union’s contribution to the summit, in November 2004 the Council invited the Commission to prepare specific ambitious proposals for action to be taken, in particular for development financing, the coherence of development policies and the priority to be given to Africa.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will today be adopting a number of communications constituting its response to the Council’s invitation. This global political package summarises the EU’s contribution to development and identifies the measures to be taken to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In many respects, your report and our communications share the same concerns and the same recommendations. I would like to mention a few of your report’s conclusions which we believe are very important and which are key points in the package of communications we will be presenting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, as you underline, it is essential that we continue increasing development aid. The Commission is proposing new intermediate targets for 2010 in this regard; additional new sources of financing must be considered alongside the public aid budgets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also welcome the attention you pay to the coherence of development policies; it is in fact essential that we look at how policies other than aid can help in achieving the Millennium Goals. The communication on the coherence of development policies identifies no fewer than 11 priority areas where the challenge of achieving synergy with the development policy objectives is considered particularly relevant, in trade, for example – that goes without saying – in research, the environment, agriculture, fishing, to name but a few. Major synergies are possible with these different competences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of your report’s recommendations are included in the EU Synthesis Report on the Millennium Goals, for example – as you rightly mention – the special attention that must be paid to the education of girls, to the necessity of meeting the needs of the most vulnerable groups, especially children, orphans, young women and the elderly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In response to the challenges Africa has to face, it is essential that the development partners give that continent priority. The European Union must do more, and wants to, to enable Africa to achieve the Millennium Goals. Africa must be the focus of our attention and it is vital that aid resources for Sub-Saharan Africa be increased. The European Union must ensure that a major proportion of the additional public development aid is directed towards Africa. Our proposals in the matter of coherence must also apply first and foremost to the African continent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in addition to all our existing programmes, especially under the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission is proposing new commitments in fields with an obvious multiplier effect. I am thinking of governance, interconnection and equity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Preparations for the New York summit are quickening apace. I also want to thank you for your contribution and I hope to continue working with you to ensure that Europe’s position is equal to the challenge of achieving the Millennium Goals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, Mrs Kinnock, I would like to say a few words about the communications which I shall shortly be submitting to the College of Commissioners. The process of preparation for the September summit has shown the progress made in many poor countries and the importance of the efforts made by the international community, and by the European Union in particular, for achieving the Millennium Goals. All the reports, the Secretary-General’s report, the Millennium Project report written under the direction of Professor Sachs, also show that the goals that were set for 2015 can still be achieved if we want to. As you said, however, this will require major investment by the developing countries as much as, obviously, by the donor countries. As the poor countries’ largest international donor and largest trading partner, the European Union therefore has a particular responsibility towards our own citizens, who expect us to set an example at international level, because it is an imperative of human solidarity, but one which is also in our own interests. If we want a more stable and a safer world, we must invest more massively in development. The EU also has a responsibility towards partners who often see Europe as a model: consider the African Union, for example, which has taken the European Union a benchmark. I believe the proposals I will be presenting this afternoon are equal to this challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those proposals have three main parts: first of all, development finance and aid effectiveness; secondly, policy coherence and, thirdly, priority for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On financing – and this will answer your question – the European Union has stuck to its commitments, and in 2006 its aid effort will probably exceed the joint target of 0.39% of the Member States’ gross national income. Obviously, this effort will have to continue, and I am proposing that the Member States set themselves a new individual intermediate target of at least 0.51% in 2010, corresponding to a collective effort of 0.56%. That would allow us to achieve the rate of 0.7% in 2015; that rate was set by the United Nations a long time ago and the Millennium Project experts believe it is necessary in order to achieve the MDGs. In terms of annual aid, that would be an increase of no less than EUR 20 billion per year in 2010, with EU aid rising from EUR 46 billion in 2006 to 66 billion in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, new sources of finance must also be encouraged. I forgot to say that I am going to suggest that the new Member States reach 0.17% in 2010; the difference is because they have much further to go; that should allow us to reach 0.7% in 2015. Additionally, then, new sources of finance must be encouraged, but that should on no account be a pretext for delaying or reducing the EU’s commitments for 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second aspect is improving aid effectiveness, another important task. The last few years have seen substantial progress in the management of Community aid. At EU level, the main challenge today is to implement the commitments given by the EU for better policy coordination, complementarity on the ground and procedural harmonisation. Europe must be much more than the mere sum of our States’ individual budgets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second aspect is the use of budget aid – to which I want to give priority – although aid effectiveness would gain much from it. It is not just a question of money, however. The real challenge is to contain globalisation by exercising a solidarity that will lay the foundations for a world social contract; that will involve not only an increase in public development aid but also global public policies that will allow the benefits of globalisation to be shared out more equitably.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Likewise, I am quite pleased to say that the Commission has for the first time agreed to talk about coherence and to identify, in competences other than development aid, no fewer than 11 areas that are development-related and may give it added value. I believe this is important. It is the first time the College has taken up this challenge and I think it is worth pointing that out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third component of our proposals is the priority given to Africa. There are three reasons for this. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most backward region. Europe is a weighty partner and Africa is a geopolitical partner that will assume increasing importance. The United States and China have already understood this, which explains their growing interest in that part of the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I propose stepping up our action in areas that have an obvious multiplier effect. There are three lines of approach here. Firstly, in the area of governance, we must support the implementation of the reforms emerging from the African peer review mechanism. We must also provide refinancing for the peace facility, to support the African Union and sub-regional organisations in conflict-prevention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would describe this first line as the political line, in the general sense of the term. The second line is the economic line. Infrastructures and network interconnections must be supported on the basis of the African Union’s and NEPAD’s strategies to facilitate South-South trade. I am in fact thinking here of really getting the large Trans-African networks off the ground as we had to do in Europe with the large Trans-European networks. We must make the construction and implementation of these large Trans-African networks a definite priority objective. That is the economic line. I am thinking of all the infrastructures, of everything associated with communications, of technology transfer, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third line is the social line. It is obviously the politics of equity. The European Union must develop incentives and support the African countries in their efforts to promote social cohesion, employment and environmental protection. I am thinking more specifically of education, health and culture. During my hearing, I said that culture was a far more important vector of development than people think and I would like to make the most of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This set of communications seeks to unite the Member States around a European vision that would give the EU the influence, credibility and visibility it needs in order to make an effective contribution to the September 2005 summit. At present, I am touring the capitals to mobilise the national parliaments and the Member States on this question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that in September these three communications will result in the complete redefinition of development policy, as I said, in the form of a new development policy statement, which I intend to translate into a common European development strategy. I see absolutely no reason why we cannot do for development what we have succeeded in doing for the common security strategy. I would also like to come up with a real plan of campaign for Africa based on the three lines of approach I have just mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, Mr President, Mrs Kinnock, honourable Members, is the reply I wanted to give you. I hope I have been complete. If there are other questions or if I have inadvertently failed to answer any of your questions, do not hesitate to ask me. I am of course at your disposal to answer them.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, we are discussing the Millennium Development Goals which are the very heart, the guiding principle and goal of the EU’s development policy. Central to these goals is the elimination of poverty. The rapporteur is right to emphasise three areas where the European Union should really do better: delivering on promises, closer policy coordination, and the more efficient deployment of resources. I am pleased that the Commissioner afforded ample consideration to this in his speech. Indeed, the pledge to set aside 0.7% of the GDP for development aid is as yet being met by only five Member States. Both policy coordination and our assistance to developing countries in developing their local and regional economies lack credibility if we, at the same time, sabotage these via our agricultural and trade policy. I am pleased that this is a major consideration for the Commissioner. Thirdly, as regards the efficient deployment of resources, we can achieve much more if we work more efficiently and make more use of the possible ‘quick wins’, such as the distribution of mosquito nets in the fight against malaria.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should also like to stress a few items of importance, which are also covered in the report. As regards the importance of education for girls, it cannot be emphasised enough that girls and women often suffer disproportionately from hunger and other problems, of which the lack of access to education is certainly one. Moreover, research shows that the education of girls has a positive bearing on the whole of society, including the fight against poverty as such.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, it is important to diversify the cultivation of products and attain a firm foothold for small and medium-sized enterprises, with a view to creating a stable economy. Thirdly, there is the need for what is termed special and differential treatment of poor countries, which will also be an important consideration for the WTO. Fourthly, the availability of, and access to, basic health care, on which any health policy depends. Finally, there is a need for the reinforcement of capacities on all fronts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In short, there is much to be done and fortunately, Europe does do a great deal. As the largest donor, Europe faces a huge challenge, as the Commissioner already stated, if it is to be the largest player in terms of vision, coherence and decisiveness.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the world leaders have the enormous responsibility of giving the agreements reached in 2000 real substance, by halving poverty, sending children to school and eliminating illness. If we apply this to Africa, we have to conclude that the situation is tragic in all these respects, because instead of bringing those goals towards 2015 closer, we are moving further away from them. At this rate, we will not achieve them in 100 years. This creates an image of incompetence on the part of world leadership, especially where Africa is concerned. That there is no need for this is clear from Mr Geoffrey Sachs’ recent report. Given sufficient funding, sound priorities in place and a sufficiently campaign-based focus, malaria could, for example, be eradicated, children – particularly girls – could go to school, and poverty could be halved.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As the Commissioner has already said, the UN Summit in September will offer the opportunity to clinch millennium deals. That is why it is, of course, extremely important that the Commission and the Council should translate the agreements reached at that Summit into European objectives for the EU. As the Commissioner said, we can do this by means of funding at Member State level, but also by this House and the Council giving multi-annual funding sufficient priority, and this being reflected in the percentage for social expenditure of the millennium goals, including, in particular, this 20% for basic education and basic health care. The current figures – 2% for education, 6% for health care, also in the European Development Fund figures – are alarming.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would urge not only the Commission and the Council, but also Parliament, to really take these requirements on board, so that we can avoid a confrontation and can together back this initiative all the way. We are prepared to give the Commission leeway in the implementation, provided that the agreements are uncompromising; above all, they need to be laid down clearly and effectively, because the current levels of 2% and 6% are really unacceptable. We would have to wait for another 100 years, and that we refuse to do.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Michel for his favourable reception of Mrs Kinnock’s report. I believe it is important that the Commission and Parliament should coordinate their positions and present a united vision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you say, the European Union is the largest donor, with 55% of world public aid. We therefore need to keep ourselves in first position and keeping promises is something that is rather well regarded in politics. I have noted the step-by-step increases you propose; the targets are both praiseworthy and achievable – Mrs Kinnock spelled them out, so I will not repeat them. An overall 0.7 is achievable, and with the stages you mention we will rise to 0.51 in 2010 and reach 0.7 in 2015.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would simply like to point out that the EUR 20 billion a year increase you mentioned is more or less the equivalent of one and a half European Development Funds a year, whereas the European Development Fund is a five-year programme. A great deal of money could therefore be paid out if we want to make that kind of effort.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I would like to draw your attention very quickly to four small points: first, the absolute necessity of policy coordination, which you illustrated with your 11 areas, also applies for agricultural subsidies if we are not going to ruin with one hand what we are giving with the other; the same is true between European countries if we are to avoid the healthy emulation that is sometimes found on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, our partners must assume some responsibility; this of course involves a governance requirement and a requirement for budget aid to be verified, which seems to be another good method, and finally, as you stressed, Mr Michel, the accompaniment of large regional projects, in particular for large Trans-African networks. We already have the possibility of using the balance of the EDF to finance some of these large networks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is the control of public money. It is essential that the way taxpayers’ money is used should be entirely visible. If we want to be able to ask for even more, we must have identifiable and demonstrable objectives for our friends in the European countries who are giving public money for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the place of the private sector. We will achieve nothing without political security, without legal security, without infrastructures and without a market. Public aid is no substitute for development involving the private sector. Let us therefore be exemplary donors, but let us be lucid partners.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in order to eradicate famine in the world, many things must be changed in the European Union. The common agricultural policy, which is not very accurate in the allocation of funds, has made things difficult in Europe and in many developing countries, especially in ACP countries. On the one hand, Europe should guarantee that the common agricultural policy is not being used to increase the benefits of large producers while small producers are in a very complicated situation. On the other hand, it should be guaranteed that product subsidies by the EU will not be an obstacle for the developing and ACP countries. Theoretically, the EU could help to eradicate poverty and famine in the world if it changed its agricultural policy. Better conditions in the developing countries should mean benefits for Europe and for the whole world. But before that, we also need to eradicate the very clear discrimination in the EU, which favours the big producers while small ones and thousands of farmers have to leave agriculture every year.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Kinnock's thorough report, with which we are in agreement, states that achievement of the Millennium Development Goals will require a change of system, a change involving the governments of countries in both the northern and southern hemispheres, as well as international financial institutions. We need to overturn the rules of international trade, rejecting the imposition of trade agreements and indiscriminate liberalisation and, instead, support fair trade and a culture based on rights – the right of access to education, water, food and healthcare. Today is the start of the Global Week of Action to deliver those rights and control international trade, and there are people here in Parliament, today, who are emphasising that need.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not the first time that the United Nations and the international community have attempted to launch a programme to eradicate poverty. However, there have been 15 years of broken promises, while the aim of devoting 0.7% of the GDP of more developed countries to the poor nations is still a remote one. Mrs Kinnock is right when she says that the policy of Italy – my country – is shameful; I share her view, although I believe that the UK’s involvement in the Iraq war is also shameful.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EU and the Member States must not fail in their moral responsibilities and obligations. Alternative sources of finance must be discussed. We must prevent spurious accounting, avoid expenditure on security being classed as development spending and stop budget figures being inflated by debt cancellation measures. The debt must be cancelled.</p>
      <p sl="it">True development cooperation can be achieved by equipping those countries with the infrastructure and tools needed for them to organise their own economic and social development. Human rights, gender, the environment, children’s rights: the issues have all been identified.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating an issue that reveals the true nature of the world about us. An attempt is being made to close the yawning gaps that currently exist between the living conditions of the people inhabiting this planet. This can also be regarded as a practical test of our understanding of the word ‘neighbour’, in relation to both individuals and nations. Speaking in this House and at this point in time, I feel obliged to mention the Holy Father John Paul II, whose memory this House honoured yesterday, as this issue was one of particular concern to him, and he appealed to the consciences of people all over the world. The history of humanity shows us that the Millennium Development Goals, which as we know were adopted in the Jubilee Year 2000, are indeed worthy of their name, as we should not forget that the fight against poverty has been waged on Earth for millennia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Millennium Goals must be implemented effectively and as rapidly as possible. I should therefore like to thank Mrs Kinnock for the effort she has put into drafting a report setting out the European Union’s role in achieving these goals. At the same time, however, I am unable to consent to pro-abortion measures masquerading under the name of reproductive health rights being termed progress, as is the case in paragraph 15.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The short speaking time available to me makes it impossible for me to examine this issue in full, even though it is of enormous significance. I should, however, like to share some thoughts on the matter with you. It is sometimes said that people are poor because they are stupid, and it is also said that they are stupid because they are poor. This vicious circle of helplessness must be broken, and aid must be given to poor countries and regions in the form of large-scale investment in education. It is true that primary education is mentioned in the second of the Millennium Goals, but in my opinion this falls a long way short of what is needed. Good secondary schools and universities must be built in these countries and regions. I would particularly like to stress that the schools and universities must be situated in the countries and regions in question, in order to ensure that these nations produce educated people who wish to help their fellow citizens. We must therefore pay close attention to the needs of local communities, instead of attempting to bestow happiness in line with someone else’s ideas, however noble they may be. Otherwise we will be building houses on sand, and our actions will amount to giving people fish rather than teaching them how to fish for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to touch upon one more issue, namely that appropriate funding is needed to solve these problems properly. This will involve a great deal of money, but no more than the richer countries, which include the European Union, can afford. The funding currently available is by no means adequate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should also like to alert the House to the fact that quite considerable funding could be obtained for this universal cause by introducing a tax on foreign exchange transactions, or in other words a Tobin tax.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it goes without saying that no one in their right minds would object to something actually being done in order to structurally reduce global poverty and hunger by 2015. In order to actually achieve this, we will need to look beyond the present report’s unilateral measures, and, above all, to admit that massive development aid of the past 30 years has in the final analysis, all things considered, had very little impact.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For example, what destroyed the favourable infrastructural and trade position in black Africa in the sixties was general corruption, ethnic conflicts and the devastating ideological hair-splitting on the part of the ruling elites. Why is it, for example, that Zimbabwe, in a matter of a few decades, has been transformed from the granary and storehouse of the whole of southern Africa into a land ravaged by terrible starvation? We should therefore have the courage to spell out the two major obstacles to lasting development of the poor countries; they are corruption and bad governance, and they are hardly our fault.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Millennium Goals are of concern to us all. It is true that development is a global concept for the all-round promotion of the welfare and dignity of human beings, but the means for achieving that can be summed up in one word: solidarity. It is therefore remarkable that the European Union provides more than 50% of world development aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union, however, does not promote respect for cultural diversity and different traditions in its external relations, even though they are the key to European integration. Financial aid conceals issues of geopolitical power and cultural influence, and the European Union sometimes buys the votes of the developing countries in the United Nations General Assembly. If we are to take joint decisions, we must listen to and respect every one, and even more so when we are looking to define positions affecting fundamental cultural and moral values. The nations of the UN who are mentioned in the Preamble to the Charter are entitled to have their dignity and their traditions respected regardless of their economic level. So far as human rights are concerned, they must be strengthened by giving them a sound ethical basis, otherwise they will remain weak and without foundations. We must reaffirm that human rights are not created or granted by anyone but that they are inherent in human nature.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The resolution on which we are being asked to vote shows the gap between how the wealth that the family represents is understood in the developing countries and in the European Union. Would we not be very much open to criticism if we were to use such important issues as the achievement of the Millennium Goals for our own ends? There cannot be real peace until donors fully respect the cultural context of the developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am convinced that Mrs Kinnock’s report makes a very considerable contribution to examining the European Union’s achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, or its progress towards doing so. As regards our chances of achieving these objectives, we are in a very, very sad state, and Mrs Kinnock’s report shows what changes in policy are needed if we are to achieve them.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say something about debt relief policy as well as about the report that we will be voting on tomorrow. It may have escaped a number of Members of this House that, when discussing debt relief policy, it has to be said that two thirds of the developing countries spend more on servicing their debts than they do on social services. That this has an effect on the achievement of – or failure to achieve – the Development Goals hardly needs to be said.</p>
      <p sl="de">What this means is that there is a need for change in many policy areas, but also for a doubling of the aid we currently give, and for the resultant amount to be sustained for at least 10 years – hence the commendation for those Member States that have already reached the 0.7% mark.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Kinnock’s report stresses the need for the 0.7% mark for bilateral development cooperation to be achieved. I regret that this cannot be the occasion for ‘naming and shaming’, but Mrs Kinnock’s explanatory statement lists the states that are a long way from reaching the 0.7% mark: Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Portugal. I would ask the Commission to perhaps produce a timetable for all the Member States or bring pressure to bear on them to get them to achieve this target.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. On the subject of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, it is proposed that the aid given to developing countries should be doubled for a period of at least a decade, that all debts should be written off until 2015, and that new additional sources of aid should be sought, by introducing new taxes for EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="lt">There is, however, very little talk of aid efficiency. By not imposing conditions such as the efficiency of the utilisation of loans given, positive tendencies for social and economic development, and requirements for the implementation of democracy and human rights, developing states will not be encouraged to accept responsibility for the social and economic development of their countries and will not feel accountable to their citizens.</p>
      <p sl="lt">When talking about aid for developing countries we ought to rethink the European Union's aid policy and offer measures by not only confining ourselves to the Millennium Goals, but by looking for ways of encouraging economic growth in developing countries, in particular investment, and especially in small and medium-sized businesses, thereby giving developing countries the opportunity to rise to a more developed level and a developed state level.

That is why we must also look at other sources of funding.</p>

Such a levy would both provide money for the poor – assuming the money is used for this, of course – and would at the same time be in harmony with the Kyoto Protocol. Quite a few governments have, to put it mildly, been hesitant to adopt this proposal, and I include my own Danish Government here. I very much hope, however, that the European Parliament will push ahead with this development.</p>
      <p sl="da">Allow me simply to mention another proposed source, namely the enormous amounts spent on our agricultural subsidies that are destroying things for the developing countries. At the very least, the damaging export subsidy should, in any case, be phased out as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, while giving my support to Mrs Kinnock’s report, I would also like to refer to Geoffrey Sachs’ statement to the effect that the achievement of the Millennium Goals requires that the EU’s strengths be combined. It is therefore necessary that we earnestly strive towards the 0.7% of GDP for development aid without further delay, and also that we ensure that the whole of the poorest countries’ debts are written off. I therefore call upon the Council to take up the opportunity presented to it this week to use the gold reserves within the IMF for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I would like to point out that the Commission for Africa has urged the necessity of a further USD 25 billion per annum being allocated in order to resolve Africa’s life-and-death problems, to which – and I would also like to draw your attention to this fact – both the IMF and the World Bank must, once and for all, give their attention, particularly in view of Paul Wolfowitz’ presidency of the latter.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, because of a late flight, I was unable to listen to most of the debate, but I am of course very familiar with the arguments and want to begin by congratulating Mrs Kinnock on an excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Millennium Development Goals are first and foremost a moral issue. The huge differences in standards of living that exist in today’s world are becoming evermore absurd. We have both the knowledge and the resources to eradicate poverty now, and there is no excuse for not stepping up our efforts. I welcome this report which contains a series of constructive proposals that I hope will influence the Commission’s work during the next few months. Certainly, the Millennium Development Goals are not easy to achieve. Increased efforts are needed not only in the industrialised countries but also on the part of the recipients. We must bring about a fairer trade system. Corruption is a major problem and must be combated vigorously. We need more money, but we also need more effective aid. The lack of coordination of donors’ contributions is a major problem. In the same way, the lack of dialogue so far within the EU about who is to do what among the Member States and in the Commission is a great problem.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The content is also crucial, of course. Allow me just to mention one area that is too often neglected within development cooperation. I am thinking of the management of natural resources. The poor majority in rural areas are completely dependent upon what is produced by the countryside. A development in which forests, pasture land, soil for cultivation and fresh water resources are decimated and reduced in quality is therefore extremely serious. A major analysis of this development, known as the millennium assessment, was presented last week and makes for depressing reading. The destruction of basic natural resources is generally accelerating throughout the world and constitutes a major obstacle to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I assume that significantly more attention will be given to this aspect of development cooperation in the Commission’s forthcoming work.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would once again thank Mrs Kinnock.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome Glenys Kinnock’s report. It is a comprehensive, practical and indeed pragmatic approach to a very serious and horrific situation. I also welcome the Commissioner’s intention to develop a common development strategy and I would urge him to engage with national parliaments, as well as with others in the Member States. I am quite sure he will find a groundswell of support for his approach to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The statistics for poverty and mortality are quite horrific. Every time this electronic clock in front of me ticks, a child dies needlessly. Every minute the clock ticks, three women die needlessly in pregnancy or childbirth. Yet there are people here who would have this Parliament decide against allowing those women to exercise their choice on their health, on the kind of contraception they might use, and whether or not they should choose abortion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge this Parliament to reject the amendments which seek to do that. This Parliament has no place dictating to women in the developing world as to how they should address their health needs.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in this brief speech, I will confine myself to one aspect in this connection, but one that is to my mind an important one, namely the role of international trade, of fair trade, in the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. I do not think that anyone stands to benefit more from promoting world trade than do the developing countries. If sub-Saharan Africa were to increase its share in world trade by 1%, its revenue from exports would increase by 60 billion. Following the ‘everything but arms’ campaign, the European Union, being the world’s largest trade bloc, should be able to make it clear that it is being serious about this by setting a date by which all export subsidies for agricultural products must be cancelled. Surely it is no longer acceptable to be given a daily subsidy of USD 2 for every cow, while half of the world population has to survive on less than that. If we abolished these unfair agricultural subsidies, it would add to the EU’s credibility in this policy area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock on an excellent report. I am very happy to introduce the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, which was passed unanimously and adopted en bloc by the Committee on Development. That demonstrates the growing consensus that while trade clearly has a role in poverty eradication, the current trends and institutions of trade policy will need urgent reform if they are genuinely to lead to poverty eradication and sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our opinion notes the recent report by UNCTAD and others that demonstrates that unfettered and extensive trade liberalisation does not necessarily translate into significant poverty eradication, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. I quote from the UNCTAD 2004 report on least-developed countries, which says: ‘The emerging post-liberal trends do not indicate that substantial and sustained poverty reduction will occur. On balance, future poverty reduction seems to have worsened’. So our first point in this opinion is to ask the Commission and Council to note that analysis and to modify trade policy accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first place they could apply that reformed trade policy is on the EU proposals for economic partnership agreements, because again increasing evidence suggests that if economic partnership agreements are to become genuine instruments of development, they have to offer non-reciprocal market access for as long as developing countries require it. I welcome recent statements from my own government in the UK that appear to guarantee poorest countries as much time as they need before acquiring that reciprocity. I urge the Council to adopt that position but warn that it will not be credible unless Article 24 of the GATT is revised accordingly as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally we call on the Council and Commission to address the almost forgotten issue of commodity prices, which is strangely absent from the WTO agenda. According to Oxfam, developing countries would have earned USD 243 billion more in 2002 if the real prices of ten key commodities had remained at their 1980 levels. That is almost five times the world’s annual aid budget. We desperately need urgent action on this issue if we are to have any chance of meeting the MDG goals.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to begin by thanking everyone who has spoken, or rather most of them, for their remarks. I think most of what has been said will be reflected in the communications which I will be asking the Commission to adopt, most probably in a few minutes’ time, and which I outlined to you a few moments ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Most of the other remarks that have been made will be debated and, I hope, decided, in the development policy statement I announced, which is being opened for very wide discussion, consultation and debate today and should therefore be ready when we reconvene in September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to highlight one fundamental topic: market liberalisation; the last speaker raised this question, and as a liberal I am sure I will surprise you here. I, too, think that market liberalisation can only be beneficial if there is a State capable of enforcing the rules. I believe that in the 1990s we were wrong to think that total market liberalisation, even where there was no State, would spontaneously create wealth for distribution. I am in broad agreement with the limits you place on market liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There will be more debates of this kind over the next few weeks and months. However, I would like to take the opportunity now to ask you whether the time for action has not now come. There have been plenty of studies, consultations and findings. We can of course continue to reflect, to debate concepts, categories and principles: all that is very important; but I would like my policy to be above all a policy of implementation, of getting things done. I am therefore appealing to you – speakers have made a number of specific proposals today: if you have definite ideas about how our development policy can be implemented effectively, I am obviously interested to hear them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Without in any way disputing the validity of some of the rules governing development, I have to say to you that when some of those rules are given a strictly technocratic application, they make the achievement of certain goals virtually impossible. That is a question I would like to be able to debate with you from time to time. In any case, I promise I will place a number of proposals before you in the next few weeks to try to be more effective. Ensuring that there is coherence between different policies is in fact one way of being more effective. Well-managed budgetary aid, sectorally oriented, for example, may obviously make us more effective; better coordination, greater harmonisation between national rules, is obviously another way of being more effective. Those are just a few examples. Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for all these comments and considerations. I promise to make best use of them.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement on the fight against malaria.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-072" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, malaria remains a disease closely associated with poverty. Every year, more than a million people die after contracting it, most of them children below the age of five. Malaria is therefore still the main cause of infant mortality in Africa. The disease affects mainly Africa, although other continents are also affected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fight against malaria continues to be under-funded, even though the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to which the European Union is the main contributor, has made more resources available to the countries concerned in the last few years. Despite these efforts at world level and despite the efforts made by the countries of the South, the annual shortfall in resources at world level will probably reach USD 2.6 billion in 2007. Given that the countries most seriously affected by this disease are also among the poorest, most of the necessary resources will have to come from external partners, if the countries concerned are to be able to fight malaria and achieve the sixth Millennium Development Goal. The European Union must therefore increase its contribution through bilateral programmes and through the Global Fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We do nevertheless have effective instruments for fighting malaria. In 2001, the Commission formulated a policy and an action programme to fight the three main diseases of poverty, that is HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In 2004, the Commission presented a review of its work, showing, among other things, that it had increased its financial contribution to the fight against these diseases four fold. This contribution includes in particular an increased allocation to research. The Commission’s annual contribution to the Global Fund is EUR 259 million for the period 2003-2006. This will enable it to support programmes proposed by the countries concerned for the production of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide that is effective long term and the production of medicines. The Commission has also adopted a new policy framework for continuing the fight against these diseases beyond 2007. That policy will be implemented in cooperation with the Member States of the European Union, with multilateral partners like the World Health Organisation, the ‘Roll Back Malaria’ programme, and with the countries of the South, including the African Union, civil society and the private sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main activities will remain essentially the same. A strong emphasis on prevention, in particular mosquito nets impregnated with long-term insecticide and the introduction of new anti-malarial drugs such as artemisinin-based combination therapies in countries where there is resistance to existing drugs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will also continue to invest in research and development of preventive vaccines, diagnostic tools and new curative drugs. If the efforts to develop new tools and drugs are to allow those that need them to have access to them on an equitable basis, the social sectors, health in particular, will obviously have to be strengthened with greater investment and more human resources in the health services.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I welcome this Commission Statement on malaria, because three years ago, by approving our contribution to the budget of the Global Fund to Fight Malaria, Tuberculosis and AIDS, the Commission accepted Parliament’s request that it report to us regularly, and the previous Commission did not always do so. Furthermore, because in the fight against contagious diseases linked to poverty, AIDS is often the focus of attention, despite the fact that tuberculosis and malaria claim more victims every year and there is more chance of their being eradicated.</p>
      <p sl="es">Just a few years ago, malaria seemed close to eradication in many countries; today it is the most frequent cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting more people and regions in which it had been eradicated. Recent figures suggest that there are more than 3 million direct and indirect victims of malaria each year. It is good that the Commission should promote the debate on the national protocols on the treatment of malaria, but that is not the most important thing if the objective is to include new therapeutic combinations, such as artemisinin and other therapeutic drugs. Mosquito nets treated with insecticides and intermittent preventive treatments significantly reduce morbimortality, but so far only Vietnam and certain countries in Latin America are showing encouraging results. In Africa, less than 10% of exposed children sleep protected by mosquito nets and the systematic use of those nets only protects 1% of the population at risk.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission, as a member of the governing council of the United Nations Fund for fighting these diseases, should increase the attention paid to malaria and, in view of experience, it should do the same with the sixth and seventh framework programmes for research and technological development, to which we provide EUR 400 million for research into these diseases, and thereby assist greater numbers of people at less economic cost, although that means fewer profits for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

      <p sl="nl">In view of a death toll of 2 million people annually, 3 000 children daily and Africa being a hotbed of it, the need to fight malaria is self-evident. It is, of course, a crying shame to realise that we have both the expertise and the means, yet nevertheless this situation persists. The medication is available and the illness is curable. Simple, impregnated bed nets are the most effective and cheapest way of preventing infection, but the reality is that only 2% of children in Africa sleep under them. That is mainly attributable to organisational blockages and bottlenecks in their distribution. Geoffrey Sachs has brought us back to face the facts. The means are there; we are now waiting for the political will. He mentions quick wins, but I can see only structural benefits if these are underpinned by real campaigns and if we set clear priorities. We have proved to the world once before that we are up to this, having managed, for example, to eradicate nearly 99% of the incidence of polio.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What matters now is not to get various poverty-related illnesses competing against each other, but to tackle the root of basic health provisions in Africa together. Naturally, as the Commissioner already said, priority should be given to the most vulnerable areas that lack basic provisions or regional structures, and where hygiene is poor. Moreover, we should not forget that 50% of Africa’s population lives in urban areas, so the problem is not only a rural one; it is also very much present in the cities, which require yet another form of organisation. It is always local organisers, those basic health provisions, and the bottlenecks in the systems that lead to problems, and I hope that, with his strategy, the Commissioner will be able to make some changes in those areas. People on the ground will be keen to lend a hand, for it is they, of course, whose parents have children who will die of malaria. They know how serious this is and will certainly want to give their full cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, Commissioner. As the unprecedented outpouring of assistance brought about by the Asian tsunami – which showed that the globalising world is able to devote significant resources to a common cause and also achieve positive results – gradually begins to recede, we must nevertheless recognise that every month smaller ‘tsunamis’ take place, and that the relief offered for dealing with them is clearly insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="et">Commissioner, malaria kills 3 million people every year, and each month this disease causes the death of 150 000 innocent children, most of whom never celebrate their fifth birthday. It is a fact that 40% of the world’s population, who live in extremely poor areas, are threatened by malaria. 90% of malaria deaths occur in the sub-Saharan region, specifically among children. In these areas, malaria kills one child every 30 seconds, and every minute of inactivity on our part leads to the death of two children.</p>
      <p sl="et">Today malaria is becoming a negative catchword worldwide, and Jeffrey Sacks, the Head of the UN Millennium Project, recently stated that if we can allocate 2-3 billion USD, it is in our power to save the 3 million victims of malaria. This money would be needed to buy or subsidise mosquito nets and insecticides, and to solve problems of immunisation.</p>
      <p sl="et">At the same time, Jeffrey Sacks has noted that it is time for Europe to take the initiative in a global sense, since the European Union is the primary donor to the global fund, and is bound by the Cotonou Agreement until the year 2020.</p>
      <p sl="et">Considering all of these facts, I had intended to present a verbal question to the commission, which – for reasons I cannot understand – was unsuccessful.</p>
      <p sl="et">Since significant advances have been made in the treatment of malaria in recent years, the Commission could ascertain what specific initiatives the European Union might adopt in order to liquidate this pandemic disease, concentrating especially on malaria prevention. Secondly, would it not be worthwhile considering how, in addition to existing public sector investment, we could also involve more private sector investment in the development of malaria vaccines?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, more than a million people die of malaria every year and at least five hundred million people contract the disease, most of them in Africa. Children and pregnant women are worst affected by the disease.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The fight against malaria is connected with the fight against poverty, but we must remember that the threat of malaria is predicted to grow with climate change. The fear is that due to global warming the malarial mosquito will spread, for example, to the southern parts of Europe and the United States. The prevention of climate change is therefore also the fight against malaria.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Recently, the role of DDT in the fight against malaria has been discussed. The use of DDT in the fight against malaria is permitted, but we must not close our eyes to the harmful effects of DDT. DDT is damaging to human reproduction, it hampers the development of children’s brains, causes nervous system disorders and weakens our resistance to diseases. Therefore, in the fight against malaria we have to do our utmost to promote the use of less harmful methods, such as its natural enemies and bed nets containing DDT and insecticides.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, while I support what the Commissioner has said in his statement, I believe that this debate concerns an immense scandal taking place in the world and in our societies. The figures provided by my fellow Members are sufficiently clear: 3 000 children die each day, particularly in the sub-Saharan countries, as a result of the disease which has been fully studied and the prevention and treatment for which is entirely within our capacity.</p>
      <p sl="es">To meet the challenge to our countries represented by this scourge is an issue on which the consistency, credibility and, of course, dignity of the European Union and the developed north in general is at stake. I therefore believe that if we are not able to deal with this problem effectively, we will not have the moral authority to talk about values or human rights; specifically, to talk about human rights in Geneva to a country such as Cuba, which has been able to eradicate this disease in its territory and which has more doctors in sub-Saharan Africa fighting this disease than the 25 states of the European Union put together.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I welcome Mr Michel’s statement that funding is to be increased in the fight against malaria, a disease that is intrinsically linked with poverty and a fresh outbreak of which has led to child deaths. We want more, though. We want the EU to take up the suggestion made by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, and to launch and play a leading role in a world anti-malaria programme, given that, owing to a lack of political will and of adequate public funding, there is still no vaccine and not even widespread distribution of insecticide-treated bed-nets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU can make the difference in the fight against poverty if it succeeds in raising funds and taking the lead in positive and far-reaching projects, as in the malaria prevention project before us. If so, the EU will be making a decisive contribution towards achieving the millennium goals, which are in fact more than goals – they are commitments that must be honoured by the Union and its Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the World Science Forum has shown that a mere 10% of the world’s research is being directed at 90% of diseases – which, being the diseases of the poor, have no market and are therefore ignored by science. It is vital, above all, to reverse the priorities of scientific research and to target diseases affecting the vast majority of the world’s population. Commissioner Michel, if Europe and the rest of the world fail to make their contribution to this effort, malaria will continue to kill and the Millennium Goals will not be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, to take up an idea from one of the other members of my Group, I simply wanted to say that in this matter of malaria we have a unique opportunity to put into practice what I said just now about the Millennium Goals: the absolute necessity that the European Union should act visibly so that our compatriots, who are the taxpayers who pay for public aid, can have something to feel proud of.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have a unique opportunity to tackle the problem of malaria and say that the European Union is assuming responsibility for that. We have the scientific resources, we have the logistical resources, we have the financial resources, and it will give us an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to development aid and to increasing happiness in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore asking the Commissioner to kindly think about the possibility, not of our being one of the main players, which I think we already will be, but of our being if necessary the only player.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank most of the speakers for their support for the European Union’s perspectives as I explained them a few moments ago. It is clear that the fight against malaria deserves Europe’s support more than ever. The Commission wants to ensure that this disease remains a political priority at global level and in our dialogue with the countries affected. As I said in my opening remarks, the fight against malaria requires efforts and resources in various areas of policy, such as research, trade and, of course, development cooperation and humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will be presenting an action programme for continuing the fight against malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS through external action. We will be working in close cooperation with the Council, with the Member States, with you and with our strategic partner, the World Health Organisation. Europe must continue to help the countries affected to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the one concerning malaria. You can be sure that the European Union will make this fight one of its policy priorities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU has gradually been adapting its structures to the new realities of the enlargement.

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of this report is to amend Regulation (EC) 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council on the establishment of territorial units for statistics (NUTS), in light of the most recent enlargement, with the aim of providing a single, uniform means of subdividing territorial units when drawing up regional statistics for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The opportunity created by EU enlargement has facilitated the introduction of necessary amendments aimed at making the system more efficient, of which I should like to highlight the redefinition of the framework of the existing administrative units and the provision relating to a category of smaller administrative units.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The provision of smaller administrative units will enable us to remedy the lack of uniformity that has characterised the NUTS classification, with the same level applying, for instance, to the whole of Sweden and to the Brussels region.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis could be placed on certain elements. He says, for example, that it is not desirable at the moment to change the legal basis of the proposal amending the regulation and he calls on the Commission to issue a communication on the matter.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There has been an alarming rise in the amount of euro counterfeiting. The euro is one of the main targets of organised criminals, who are highly sophisticated and take advantage both of the fact that the EU no longer has any internal borders and of the lack of technical and operational resources in some of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What we need are joint, harmonised and effective responses, which must involve close cooperation with Europol.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The proposal tabled by six Member States, however, enabling Europol to be designated as the EU's Central Office for combating euro counterfeiting, is not realistic, owing to its limited capacity to carry out its duties.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In spite of its good intentions, the proposal does not solve the underlying problems of Europol’s structure. Europol must be communitarised, provided with Community funding and given a more easily amendable legal basis. It must also be subject to qualified majority rule and the codecision process, and be under the democratic control of Parliament and the Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I endorse this report because, as things stand, the euro can only be adequately protected if the national central offices currently in existence retain their powers to protect the euro. As such, a mechanism must be established aimed at close cooperation and exchange of information between those offices and Europol.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the designation of Europol as the Central Office for combating euro counterfeiting, which is surely a problem we can only effectively tackle collectively rather than an individual member states.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to maintain the current downward trend in counterfeiting statistics, such as the respective 5% and 38% decline in false 50 and 100 euro notes, we must continue to take further steps towards an appropriate collective legal framework, within which euro counterfeiting can be clearly criminalised and information centralised to make anti-fraud action more effective.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Given its value, the territory it covers and the importance attached to it by economies outside the Community as a monetary unit of reference, the euro is now one of the most sought-after currencies among counterfeiters, who are using increasingly sophisticated techniques and methods that the authorities of individual Member States are often unable to combat.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Consequently, we must always be on the lookout for the best ways of protecting the euro and of establishing effective Europe-wide combat against euro counterfeiting.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this regard, I believe that Europol can play an important role in centralising and disseminating information, thereby contributing towards the effectiveness of the national offices in charge of fighting this type of crime. If it is to take on this role, however, its capacity to interact and its operational capability must be enhanced. Unless such changes take place, and in light of its budgetary and legal limitations, as the rapporteur rightly points out, one is entitled to raise doubts as to its ability to accomplish that task.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome the Demetriou report on the European Police College and voted in favour of it, even though it does not go far enough for my liking. I did of course have the honour of floating the idea of a European Police College back in 1998, following which the idea was taken up at the Tampere Summit. It was originally set up as a network of national colleges, and this report represents the final step in its becoming an institution.</p>
      <p sl="de">That said, I have to say that we need to press on down this road if this college is to become a real institution serving – as was Parliament’s intention from the very outset – the training of national and European police units, and the training of police officers from every nation in accordance with European standards.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Police cooperation is a key factor in providing European citizens with a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice. Accordingly, the police services must be continually developed and a wide range of common quality standards for policing methods throughout Europe must be adopted.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The balance sheet on the first three years of the European Police College (CEPOL) is clearly positive – considerable advances have been made. This is in spite of the difficulties caused by the absence of legal status and of a seat, and by the fact that its budget has been financed by Member State contributions. Decisions on the issues of the seat and the legal personality were adopted in 2004.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The purpose of the proposal before use is to transform CEPOL into a Union body with legal personality and status; to accord it increased powers and Community funding; to provide it with its own seat, departments and staff, who will be subjected to EU rules and regulations; to replace voting by unanimity with voting by majority; and to provide for the use of all official languages and access to documents.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I endorse the Demetriou report and the amendments tabled by the rapporteur aimed at minimising the risks involved in centralising the system. I must also highlight that training provided by CEPOL is to be complemented at national level and that the national institutions must continue to work as a network.</p>

      <p sl="el">The objective in establishing and upgrading the European Police College is to speed up the adaptation of the national law-enforcement authorities in each country to the fight against the grass-roots movements threatening the policy of the EU. It forms part of the more general effort to adapt the repressive mechanisms of each Member State of the EU to the so-called fight against terrorism. It aspires to provide a uniform 'education' for the police forces of the Member States, so that they will be more effective in guarding the interests of big business and in preventing and suppressing grass-roots fights and demonstrations. In the face of this requirement, national sovereign rights are being ceded so that the common interest of the plutocracy in each country can be served by yet another repressive mechanism which requires extended jurisdiction, a legal personality and the capacity to interfere in the internal affairs of all the countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, the aim is to train police forces in 'non-military crisis management', in other words in combating grass-roots demonstrations in non-EU countries as well.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Commission’s proposal is of major importance in the times in which we live. Crime is, broadly speaking, on the rise throughout Europe, and a more effective European Police College (CEPOL) will help the public to feel safer.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The amendments tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and by the Committee on Budgets, adopted unanimously in committee, have improved the original proposal significantly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">CEPOL was conferred legal personality in 2004 and now requires further development.

      <p sl="pt">Coming from Portugal as I do, and speaking as the vice-chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I have significant concerns, you will appreciate, about the future of maritime transport. As I have said before, I believe in the virtues of increasing the use of sea and river transport for both passengers and goods. I also believe, along with the Commission communication and the report before us, that this will only happen if we work at various levels, for example by removing bureaucracy, by streamlining administration and by striving to improve the infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Along with inland water transport, which is a secure, environment-friendly means of transport and which accounts for around 7% of the goods traffic of the former 15 Member States, coastal shipping also deserves greater attention and promotion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the proposal before us, which takes a significant step towards the ‘motorways of the sea’ that we wish to see. I should like to highlight the introduction of coordinated measures in the areas of shipping, ports and intermodality policy in order to boost the role of ports as transport network hubs, along with measures to ease administrative and customs formalities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I feel that this resource, which is valuable and sustainable over the medium and long term, remains under-funded. As the report points out, it will only be profitable to make the heavy investment needed to provide regular, frequent and varied services if there is sufficient concentration of tonnes transported. For this to happen, port facilities must be improved and the possibilities offered by new technologies must be exploited.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In line with the targets set in the 2001 White Paper, the ‘motorways of the sea’ should be made part of the trans-European transport network in the same way as motorways or railways.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of the proposal before us is to introduce new measures concerning the European research area intended to help meet the target set at Lisbon of the EU becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is particularly important that this legal instrument be adopted, because in order to achieve this goal Europe will need some 700 000 more researchers by 2010. Accordingly, it is essential to facilitate, by means of a specific simplified procedure, the admission and mobility of third-country nationals for the purpose of scientific research, to make the Union’s labour market more attractive to researchers from around the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nonetheless, whereas the aim is to foster the admission and mobility of researchers, it is also essential that monitoring measures be put in place to ensure that this does not lead to a brain drain in the least developed countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">in writing. I welcome this report as a step closer towards the goals of the Lisbon Strategy. The Kok report identifies ‘increasing Europe's attractiveness for researchers and scientists’ and ‘making R[amp]D a top priority’ among the policy areas requiring urgent action.</p>
      <p sl="en">These Commission proposals further the establishment of a European research area, aimed at breaking down the barriers between national research systems and enhancing the mobility of researchers, thus promoting the transfer of expertise and the formation of scientists' networks.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential for non-EU researchers to be taken in if we wish to meet the Barcelona target of investing 3% of the Member States’ GDP in research and technological development. In order to do so the EU will need to recruit 700 000 researchers by 2010 and it will not be able to produce this number of researchers itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore essential to remove the barriers preventing scientists from coming to the EU. However, I appreciate that a balance must be struck between the need to give the European research area a boost and immigration and security concerns.

It is also essential to bear in mind, however, that it is difficult to see the removal of human capital from developing countries as a way of helping or cooperating. Policies of this nature must therefore always be properly thought through and well balanced.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The need for more researchers must be filled initially by adopting a range of integrated measures, such as boosting the appeal of science to young people, improving career prospects for researchers in the EU and increasing opportunities for training and mobility.

      <p sl="sv">The fact that the EU is to define common minimum standards governing basic common procedural rights for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings may appear laudable. The proposal is, however, part and parcel of setting up a common criminal justice system. Guarantees of these minimum rights already exist in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed by all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is doubtful whether the principle of subsidiarity has been observed and whether there is any legal basis in the Treaty for harmonising the Member States’ criminal justice systems. Legal uncertainty will, moreover, arise as to whether the European Court of Human Rights or the Court of Justice of the European Communities has the preferential right of interpretation.</p>

We have recently seen whistleblowers hounded out of their jobs, and the charter that Mr Kinnock set out for whistleblowers is simply not working. We have no decent benchmarks from the Court of Auditors, so Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control cannot judge whether things are improving within the Commission’s accounts. And the buck does not seem to stop with the Commission, even though the Treaties say that it does: the Commission is always pointing the finger at the Member States saying that is where the money goes missing and it is not its problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted against the Parliament’s reports on the budgetary discharge because, for the tenth year running, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance for the EU accounts. Conservatives believe that this must be tackled as a matter of urgency by the Commission, with zero tolerance of all cases of mismanagement and fraud, focusing on three main areas:</p>
      <p sl="en">1. The accounting systems must be improved. The new system must be monitored closely to ensure that it is delivering the world class standard of accounts that we are promised.</p>
      <p sl="en">2. Whistleblowers must actually be positively encouraged to come forward. To achieve this all whistleblowers must be treated fairly and must be seen to be treated fairly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I welcome the support for the discharge in committee. It is now up to the Commission to monitor the implementation of the general budget. The conclusion that one can draw from Mr Wynn’s excellent report is that levels of implementation were broadly positive. The rapporteur does say, however, that this was in contrast to the worrying discrepancy between amounts made available and implementation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I feel that this warning is more than appropriate. As such, we will be able to strike a better balance, in the new financial perspectives for 2007-2013, between drawing up policy and the process of ensuring that it is implemented correctly. It is therefore all the more important that we re-examine the governance set-up in the Commission and the distribution of administrative processes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Without prejudice to each Member State’s responsibility to implement each budget, which I wish to highlight (and which I support), it is important to remedy the organisational and bureaucratic problems that had hampered it (research and consumer protection being glaring examples) and had led to low implementation levels (68%) in an area as crucial as that of freedom, security and justice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I very much regret that Parliament has voted for discharge in spite of the fact that there is an outstanding claim against one of its former Members for falsely claiming allowances. I am not going to comment in this speech on whether the former British Conservative MEP, Mr Bashir Khanbhai, was responsible for falsely claiming expenses. However, I note that, as long ago as July 2004, the Quaestors concluded that he had done so, and here we are, nearly ten months later in April 2005, and no money has been repaid. The protracted length of this matter is bringing this Parliament into disrepute. I hope that next year, when we come to the discharge of Parliament’s budget, this matter will be long concluded.</p>

They need to be able to protect their sources and contacts among the electorate. In the light of this, we have voted against the demands for annual audits of MEPs’ office expenditure allowances. In the case of one item, we have, for technical reasons, been forced to vote in favour of an annual audit because we support the requirement that the deficit of the European Parliament’s pension fund should not be covered by public funds.</p>

      <p sl="de">I cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control, full as it is of unreasonable assertions, misrepresentations and false suppositions as regards Members’ remuneration, the reimbursement of their travelling and general expenses, and the rules on voluntary pension arrangements. It is positively repugnant how individual Members attempt to make a name for themselves using disinformation and defamation in some of the media, all of which ends up doing harm to the good name of this House and of the EU as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">The irresponsible attempt by various self-appointed clean-up operators to depict as fiddlers the generality of MEPs who keep to the rules and are guilty of not one single breach of them can no longer be tolerated. My abstention from voting on this report – even though I voted in favour of the considerable improvements made to it – is intended to make that a matter of record.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another reason why I am unable to vote in favour of this report is that its statements concerning Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg and its places of work in Luxembourg and Brussels quite simply go against the Treaty currently in force and the decisions that have been taken on where Parliament should sit. The additional costs that it denounces as a consequence of our working in three places are largely the result of a wildly inaccurate calculation which takes no account of the advantages of these decentralised arrangements, and behind which – I would add – lies the unwarranted egoism of the Brussels lobby.</p>

Otherwise, the report contains certain points and recommendations that completely justify my vote in favour. In this context, I wish to express my support for single status for MEPs, which would put an end to the unacceptable inequality between people elected by equal citizens. I also endorse the objective of turning Brussels into Parliament’s sole, permanent seat in order to make best use of human and financial resources; after all, for Parliament to have two seats implies twice the cost, which is burdensome and absurd.

      <p sl="pt">I welcome the good results obtained in 2003, the first financial year for which the Directors-General have drawn up annual activity reports. The Secretary-General subsequently forwarded them to the President and to the Committee on Budgetary Control, with a declaration offering reasonable assurance that Parliament’s budget was implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, and as to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. A high level of budgetary implementation was also achieved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I regret the fact that this report has been seen as an opportunity for further attacks on Strasbourg as a seat of Parliament. It is true that having two seats generates high and unnecessary costs, as well as great inconvenience. Opting for Brussels, however, is not the only way forward and would be a divisive and short-sighted move. Alternatively, we could hold every sitting in Strasbourg, which, as much as anything, would strengthen Parliament’s day-to-day practical and functional independence from the Council, the Commission and their bureaucracies. This, to my mind, is the right response to the situation. It is only if we take such a decision – a permanent seat in Strasbourg and an end to the moveable feast – that the French authorities and the local authorities in Strasbourg will make the necessary investment and will justify lasting modifications to the transport system.</p>

From the creation of the first agency, in the 1970s, until the most recent – the European Network and Information Security Agency, set up in March 2004 – the execution of specific tasks of a technical, scientific or management nature has effectively become visible, which was among the guiding objectives of their creation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have drawn on the experience gained in order to find new methods and make improvements, both in terms of their integration and the transparency of their activities and in terms of enhancing complementary action, whereby the necessary resources are better organised and geared more efficiently towards achieving results and a communication strategy is devised to disseminate those results. These are some of the methods suggested in the report, to which I would add that we must scrutinise the day-to-day running of the projects and the actual relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of each agency model in terms of how it is implemented and of its contribution to Community policies.</p>

Against this backdrop, as I said in the other parliamentary seat, I feel it is essential that 20% of EU expenses earmarked for development cooperation should be channelled into basic education and health in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Development Fund (EDF) is a key instrument in implementing such policies in the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Consequently, as this report proposes, the Commission must speed up disbursement of EDF aid in order to prevent resources not being used, an alarming tendency that has come to light.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President. I would like to make a couple of comments on Article 47 of Glenys Kinnock's report. It presents a superficial and inhuman attitude to the question of abortion. In the text abortion is viewed as a technical procedure, where the only concern is for the woman's physical safety, nothing is said about mental factors and only the woman is discussed, not that person who could be born. It also approves in essence any legal regulation, by stating that there must be some sort of legal regulation. In some countries, particularly beyond the borders of the European Union, this may be entirely unacceptable. Thus with such an attitude to abortion not only the initiators, but the European Parliament itself, help cruelty take root in our society.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the past five years under various governments we have seen an intensification of political, economic and social reform in Bulgaria during its negotiations for European Union membership. I have had the honour and pleasure of acting as Parliament’s rapporteur for Bulgaria throughout this period. Bulgaria is now on the brink of accession. The most important role now to be performed by Parliament is to give its assent to Bulgaria’s application to become a Member State of the European Union. I trust that tomorrow Parliament will warmly endorse the recommendation for accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">The process of modernisation does not stop with the signature of the Accession Treaty, which we hope will take place on 25 April.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note that the Accession Treaty for Bulgaria, and, indeed, Romania, differs from the treaties with the previous group of accession countries in two important respects. Firstly, there are the ‘safeguard clauses’, which would allow accession to be delayed by up to a year in certain circumstances. To my mind it is unfortunate that Bulgaria has been caught in the wake of concerns that are more acute in relation to another country. I have always insisted that Bulgaria should be judged on its own merits, in which case the invocation of safeguard clauses should be seen as a remote possibility. Nevertheless, they are a reminder that much still remains to be done in terms of modernisation and the practical implementation of legislation. It is only right that Parliament be fully involved in any consideration of application of the safeguard clauses. The Commission, therefore, must take full account of Parliament’s views and I understand that Commissioner Rehn will give us further reassurance on this point.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second difference is that ratification of the European Constitution becomes concurrent with ratification of the Accession Treaty. On a personal note, I should point out that my reservations about this are mollified by my expectation that the Constitution will fail, and so blushes will be spared.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have just returned from Sofia. There is a pre-election mood in the country. All the political parties are in favour of EU accession and well understand that there is much work still to be done. The next government will have to mobilise resources and demonstrate real political determination to bring about the necessary reforms, in particular of the judiciary and the police services. There must be public confidence in the effectiveness and impartiality of the fight against corruption, organised crime and trafficking. The pre-trial phase and the role of the Public Prosecutor are two particular concerns that must be further addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many other issues. The integration of the Roma community remains a priority. This is a matter of resources and political will on the part of government and motivation on the part of the Roma community to adapt to the norms of mainstream society. I am not convinced by an amendment to my report calling for some new regulatory body with all its inevitable bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the subject of Kozloduy, the Bulgarian authorities, assisted by the international community, have introduced exceptional safety measures and responded positively to the requirement for closure of certain units. A little flexibility should now be shown in return, bearing in mind the important contribution Bulgaria makes to regional energy needs. I am encouraged by the decision of the Bulgarian Government to relaunch the construction of the second nuclear power plant at Belene.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 30 March members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted overwhelmingly for the text of my report as it now stands and I, therefore, do not recommend further amendment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on a separate but nevertheless important matter, I welcome the invitation by Libya for a visit by the President of Bulgaria. I hope this will lead to the early release of the Bulgarian and Palestinian health workers arrested in 1999 and now under sentence of death. At the same time, we strongly support the practical assistance being given by the European Union to help relieve the suffering of children affected by HIV.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an exciting time for Bulgaria. We are on the eve of the assent vote for Bulgaria’s accession and I strongly urge the House to vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I have said to you on several previous occasions, following the negotiation of the accession conclusions with Bulgaria and Romania at the European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004, the Commission issued an opinion in favour of this accession on 22 February 2005. It is now Parliament’s turn to give its assent to the applications of the two countries. In this context, I think it is important – and I believe that Mr Van Orden shares this point of view – to avoid dissociating the votes on Bulgaria and Romania. We should therefore be equally welcoming in both cases, and resoundingly so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Committee on Foreign Affairs also voted in favour of Romania’s accession by a very substantial majority, and today I am asking you to give your assent to Romania’s accession. Why should you do so? I am doing so because I continue to champion a positive, clear and rigorous attitude. Positive because Romania’s accession is a political objective of the European Union and is what the Romanians want. Positive because a great deal of effort and a great deal of progress have been made on the road to accession, and I believe that this has acted as a catalyst on Romanian society: the previous government had started to work, the present one is continuing the job and we are on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, I suggest being clear and rigorous because, let us not deny it, problems remain, and we are familiar with them. Much remains to be done in the field of justice and home affairs, in particular in connection with the fight against corruption, organised crime, border controls, and the recognition and protection of minorities, including the Roma and the Hungarian minorities, as well as in the fields of competition and the environment. The Romanian Government must, we will continue to say, focus in particular on actually implementing administrative and judicial reform, on the fight against corruption, on the fight against social exclusion and poverty, on freedom of information, which is of course decisive for us, and on strengthening local and regional governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add finally that there are safeguards or instruments that mean that we can continue to act. I am thinking, for example, of the possible recourse to the safeguard clauses, which should not be seen as a sanction but rather as a lever for action, as a way of exerting positive pressure to ensure that matters move in the right direction, particularly in the areas that I have just mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this in mind, the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs focused on an absolutely decisive point, that is the role of our Parliament. You see, one question concerns us in this assent procedure: what is going to happen once the Accession Treaty is signed, since the Council is asking the European Parliament to give its assent to an accession that will not take place for another twenty months? This procedure is actually unusual, since as a rule we give our assent further down the line. Many Members are concerned about this situation. They fear that by, as it were, signing a blank cheque, they will forgo any capacity to act in the period of time that separates us from the actual accession, and this when problems exist – and may even increase – and when there is a possibility of a safeguard clause being invoked. It is therefore important for the Commission and the Council to involve the European Parliament fully in monitoring the situation to ensure that Romania respects its commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a meeting of the committee concerned, Commissioner Rehn gave a political undertaking to involve Parliament in preparing for the accession of the two countries, and in particular to consult Parliament should the safeguard clauses be used. Several Members have worked on this issue and we have had amendments tabled on the citations and recommendations made in the reports on Bulgaria and Romania, because essentially Parliament has a role to play as a partner in these two situations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President Borrell, who has been very active on this matter, has moreover written a letter to President Barroso on the subject, asking him to confirm the position adopted by Commissioner Rehn on 30 March, which he has done, but I imagine that he will mention this himself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, has also had an exchange of letters on this subject with President Borrell. What can we expect today therefore, if not a confirmation of this undertaking not only from the Commission but also from the Council Presidency today or tomorrow? I hope, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office, that you will be able to give us some reassurance on this point so that we can all vote in favour of this assent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It will then be incumbent on the European Parliament, when the Commission publishes its next report in November, to assess whether this undertaking has been respected and to draw the necessary conclusions. In any case, what we want is for Parliament to be able to adopt this report by as large a majority as possible, for it to do so in an awareness that this marks a new phase in the enlargement of the European Union and in the completion of a joint project, but also for it do so with the feeling that I detected when I spoke to many Members, the feeling that Europe needs to be protected, that it should be possible to vote in safety and that this Parliament should also be one of the guarantors of that protection and that safety.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the European Parliament report approved unanimously last night has two fundamental origins. Firstly, the Council’s statement in March 2004 that the financial package proposed by the Commission for Bulgaria and Romania is fair and balanced, entirely excluding the other arm of the budgetary authority.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, the Council intends to include fixed sums in the annex to the Accession Treaty, for 2007 to 2009, for non-obligatory expenses which are to become obligatory, thereby violating the institutional and budgetary competences of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Parliament profoundly regrets that the Council has systematically refused to reach an agreement in order to produce a joint declaration with Parliament on the financial implications of the accession of these two countries. For Parliament, the lack of will on the part of the Council demonstrates a lack of honest cooperation within the spirit of the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament firmly rejects this violation of its budgetary competences.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this annex, in which the figures will be established, items that are entirely the competence of the European Parliament are becoming obligatory. So Parliament is calling on the Council to agree to this joint declaration. We are leaving this door open until the signature of accession: for the Council to agree to draw up this joint declaration.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, it should be emphasised that the Council should be in no doubt that its refusal is sending a horrendous signal for the future negotiations on the financial perspectives.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and I would actually have preferred to put before you today a joint negotiated statement that would secure Parliament’s rights in matters of budgetary policy and present a credible financial package in respect of Romania and Bulgaria. I would also have hoped that the Council would have learned something from the many and varied difficulties that we had with the last enlargement round, but, lamentably, the efforts of this House’s delegation to the negotiations and also of the Luxembourg Presidency have not been crowned with success in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may allude to what Mrs Dührkop Dührkop said, Parliament’s rights, whether in relation to the Budget or to anything else, are not peanuts; they may not just be infringed at any appropriate opportunity. To do so puts the next packages, on which – in the interests not only of the European Union’s capacity to act – we are to negotiate together, in a poor and unfavourable light. For that reason, I want to reiterate, for the record, that we, on the basis of the figures and estimates that the Commission has made available to us, as well as of our own investigations, are taking it as read that the total sum of money set aside for Bulgaria and Romania from 2007 to 2013 is likely to amount to some EUR 44.3 billion, including EUR 16 billion in the period prior to 2009 – some EUR 12.5 billion has been agreed in the Accession Treaty – and EUR 28 billion for the period from 2010 to 2013. That is one thing. The problem with it, though, is that, if there is no Financial Perspective, these agreements infringe the European Parliament’s budgetary prerogative, as they make non-obligatory expenditure into commitments and hence interfere to some degree with Parliament’s room for manoeuvre and structuring options in the event of the failure of the Financial Perspective, especially in the areas of internal and foreign policy, in subsequent financial planning. With such a poor outcome to negotiations, that is something that every Member and every political group should consider very carefully.</p>

    <intervention id="2-176" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Schmit" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the founding fathers of the Community clearly stated in 1957 in the Treaty of Rome that they were, ‘determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe’. In the preamble to this Treaty, the Member States call upon the other peoples of Europe – including the countries that were separated from it at the time – who share the same ideals of peace and liberty, to join in their project to build a united Europe. Tomorrow, by adopting the assents marking the completion of the Union’s fifth enlargement, comprising Bulgaria and Romania, the European Parliament will enable the Union to take a decisive step forward in the process of unifying our continent. This is a further stage in the unification process, the Bulgarian and Romanian nations thus regaining their place within this Europe, whose history, heritage and culture they share. These two countries will thus find their proper place in a continent open to culture, learning and social progress, as the preamble to the Constitution underlines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By giving your assent, you are making a vital contribution to a Europe without demarcation lines, a Europe of democracy, freedom, peace and progress, sharing the same values that have been embedded in the Constitution for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the accession of these two countries to the Union is first and foremost an accession to these values, to this European model to which the citizens of Europe, all European citizens, are attached.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our most noble ambition, shared by the citizens of these two countries, who have won back their freedom after almost five decades of sometimes terrible oppression, is precisely to anchor these countries in these values.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will ask a simple question, which is also addressed to the honourable Member: can any convinced European who wishes to move Europe forward along the path of democracy and human rights, but also of social rights, reasonably take the risk of rejecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, an integral part of the Constitution, which marks a fundamental milestone in the building of our Europe, of a Europe based on common values?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">These two countries have moreover been fully involved in drafting this Constitution, which will give Europe more solid foundations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The success of this enlargement depends not only on the practical efforts made by Bulgaria and Romania in the process of reforming their societies. It also needs the support of our citizens, who must understand the significance of this enlargement for the stability of our continent. The European Parliament has a vital role to play in lending its political legitimacy and credibility to this process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This fifth enlargement process, which was launched in 1997 by the Luxembourg European Council, has been comprehensive, inclusive and progressive. The twelve countries involved have all undergone the process under the same conditions and have been called on to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria. It has taken place in phases, at each candidate country’s own pace, depending on its degree of preparation. This has made it possible to ensure that each country has had the same opportunities to join the European Union, but also the same obligations to meet. At the European Council of December 2002, which decided on the accession of the ten new Member States, the declaration on a single Europe underlined the continuous, inclusive and irreversible nature of the enlargement process, clearly announcing our objective of wishing to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as new Member States in 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The accession negotiations have not always been easy – as the Commission can certainly confirm – but I think that the results contained in the Accession Treaty are fair and appropriate and broadly in line with the results of the negotiations with the ten new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Bulgaria and Romania now have about twenty months to put the finishing touches to their preparations for accession. In its latest regular reports, the Commission considered that, given the progress made by these two countries, their track record in implementing their commitments and the preparatory work in progress, they should be ready to join the Union on 1 January 2007. The Commission confirmed this conclusion with its favourable opinion of 22 February on the accession of the two countries. The European Council considered that Bulgaria and Romania will be able to assume all of the obligations arising from accession, provided that the two countries continue their efforts within the time allowed, that they complete all of the necessary reforms and that they honour all of the commitments given in each of the areas of the acquis .</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are not unaware of the legitimate questions about the proper and timely implementation of the acquis , in particular in the field of justice and home affairs, in Romania’s case, and also of the competition and environment policies. There is no short cut on the road to accession. The credibility of the process depends on the fact that each country can only join on the basis of the same political and economic criteria and its capacity to fulfil all of the obligations arising from membership. This implies the existence of the necessary administrative and judicial capacity to complete this task successfully.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Bulgaria and Romania are fully aware of what is expected of them as future Member States. Since the accession negotiations were opened, the Union has emphasised what accession to the European Union means: full acceptance of all of the rights and obligations, both current and potential, arising from the Union’s system and its institutional framework, including the Constitution – for which I am more optimistic – as well as the real and actual implementation of the acquis .</p>
      <p sl="fr">Looking at the reports of Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden on the applications for accession of Bulgaria and Romania, I am convinced that we share the same analysis that these two countries should be in a position to join the Union in January 2007 and to assume fully the obligations arising from their accession.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the meantime, the Union will continue to support Bulgaria and Romania in their preparations by all the means at its disposal. Until the day of accession, the Europe Agreements, which were concluded in 1994, will remain in force. They have functioned properly and been a key tool for preparing Bulgaria and Romania for accession. But it is clear that it is incumbent on Bulgaria and Romania to make every effort to be ready. It would be impossible to underestimate what this means in economic, social and political terms, and the work done so far certainly deserves all our respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union will continue to monitor carefully the preparations made by the two countries and the results achieved, including the actual implementation of their commitments. I can assure you that the Luxembourg Presidency takes the work of monitoring very seriously. In fact it is vital to the two countries’ own interests to be really ready. If they were not, they would run the risk of not being able to benefit fully from being members, if, for example, it were to prove necessary to invoke the safeguard clauses in certain sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are aware of the institutions’ respective roles in this context. Let us be quite clear about this: assuming assents from the European Parliament to the applications for accession by the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania, if the Commission submits a recommendation to the Council seeking to implement one of the safeguard clauses in the Accession Treaty, the Council’s decision will take due account of the position of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council gives this assurance today to Parliament, which is right to wish to monitor developments in the two countries closely. As we have already heard, a letter to this effect has been sent by the President of the European Council to the President of the European Parliament. I would reiterate that enlargement can only succeed if it enjoys the broad support of the peoples of the Union. You represent these peoples. You represent the citizens of Europe. Your voice has to be listened to, your judgment deserves to be taken fully into account should any decisions have to be made about implementing safeguard clauses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this in mind, may I remind you that the work of the European Parliament does not end with your assent. Your political contribution to the enlargement process will continue to be valuable. We are grateful for the political support that you have lent to the process as it has unfolded, in particular by engaging in an open and constructive dialogue with your counterparts, the elected members of the Bulgarian and Romanian parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, allow me to remind you that the historic project that you are debating today is the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. All of us agree that the accession of these two countries will constitute a decisive step towards putting the injustice and artificial division of Europe behind us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should now like to say a few words about the financial implications. Concerning the financing of this enlargement to 27 countries with Bulgaria and Romania, I should like to remind you that the negotiations with these two countries have been conducted on the same basis and in accordance with the same principles as those that were applied to the ten new Member States. On the basis of a proposal from the Commission, the Member States have approved a financial package setting out the only identifiable expenditure in favour of these two countries, which will cover a period of three years, as was the case for the ten. Afterwards it is the acquis that will apply, including the next financial perspective. It is a question of justice and fair treatment, but also of predictability for the two countries. We cannot negotiate without putting the cards on the table, particularly where the financial aspects are concerned for the first difficult steps that they will take as Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is clear that, given the date envisaged for the accession of these two countries, the situation in which we find ourselves is different from that experienced by the ten new Member States. For this reason, we already established an essential principle at the Thessaloniki European Council: discussions on the future political reforms or the new financial perspective must not stand in the way of continuing or concluding the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania. In the same way, the results of these negotiations must not prejudge the discussions or agreement on the political reforms or the new financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Like you, I regret that it was not possible to reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament. We were very close to an agreement. Was it the jangling of nerves – particularly, I think, in the Council, to be fair – before the difficult negotiations on the financial perspective, which prevented us from reaching this agreement? I would like to reiterate clearly that there may have been some misunderstandings. Perhaps certain technical considerations prevailed over a positive political approach. I can assure you, on behalf of the Presidency, that, for us, the European Parliament’s institutional and budgetary powers and competences are in no way called into question by the proposals tabled, and that the interinstitutional agreement remains fully valid. I cannot promise, as Mr Böge has asked, to seek an agreement on a declaration even before the agreement is signed, but we will make one final effort to do so, and who knows?</p>

    <intervention id="2-177" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, following your positive resolutions in December, in February the Commission adopted a favourable opinion on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union. In fact, if they complete their homework successfully, these two countries will be represented in this House in less than two years’ time. They will take their places here as observers after the Accession Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to stress, as I did at the Foreign Affairs Committee on 29 March, that President Barroso and I have repeatedly underlined that while the conclusion of the negotiations and the signature of the Accession Treaty imply that agreement has been reached on the terms and conditions for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, they do not mean that the preparations for membership are complete. In the remaining 21 months, Bulgaria and Romania must deliver on key reforms and fully meet the commitments they have made in the course of the negotiations. The clock is ticking. Every day, every week, every month counts from now on. Both countries are the subject of very close monitoring by the Commission, by the Member States and by Parliament. They will remain so until the eve of accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to reassure you that if the Commission judges, on the basis of its monitoring, that either Bulgaria or Romania are manifestly unprepared for membership, I would not hesitate to recommend the use of the remedial tools. This includes the clause allowing us to postpone accession by one year until 2008. I am convinced that the honourable Members of Parliament will agree to this approach. I therefore look forward to a regular dialogue with you on the implementation of Bulgaria and Romania’s commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">As President Barroso confirmed in a letter to President Borrell last week, the Commission will seriously consider the views of Parliament before issuing any recommendation on this issue, in particular after the release in November of our Comprehensive Monitoring Report on the progress towards accession made by Romania and Bulgaria. For this, I would like to thank especially the Committee on Foreign Affairs, its chairman, rapporteurs, and the coordinators for their cooperation and for a very sound solution. In my view, this respects the Treaty and at the same time gives the European Parliament a voice in the process in the spirit of true European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I visited Sofia in mid-March and Bucharest at the beginning of March. Let me give you a brief outline of the Commission’s current assessment of the progress made by the two countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Van Orden’s report on Bulgaria welcomes the conclusion of the accession negotiations. The country has indeed made steady progress in recent years. Nonetheless, Bulgaria needs to keep up the momentum in its preparation for accession. We are watching this closely through our intensified monitoring mechanism. Bulgaria needs to make sound and solid efforts to reform the judiciary, and to fight against corruption and organised crime. The reform of the judiciary, in particular of the pre-trial phase, is the overarching priority until accession. This is the priority of all priorities for Bulgaria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn to Romania. In its opinion on Romania, the Commission called on the country to pursue with determination the reforms that still need to be made. In particular, this covers the effective implementation of reforms of the public administration and the judiciary, the fight against corruption and the fulfilment of the commitments made in the field of competition and state aid, as well as the environment. In his report, Mr Moscovici adds to these priorities organised crime and the control of external borders. I fully share his views. These must be among the critical conditions when we evaluate Romania’s progress towards accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">Romania has started to tackle the accession requirements seriously, especially in the field of justice reform and the fight against corruption. I am glad to say today that all the key strategic documents required as a result of the negotiations have recently been transmitted by the Romanian Government to the Commission on time. These concern the fight against corruption, reform of the justice system and border security. The documents are currently being assessed by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">In another key area which we will be watching very closely, that of competition and state aid, Romania has inter alia fulfilled its obligation to submit its national plan for steel restructuring, and has done this on time before the deadline.</p>
      <p sl="en">Progress is also being made in the areas of police cooperation, where new laws on the Gendarmerie and the National Police have been adopted. Romania is engaged in discussions to determine the shape of its future funding commitments regarding border management.</p>
      <p sl="en">The political determination now has to be further translated into concrete actions. Based on my frequent meetings with the Romanians in both Bucharest and in Brussels, I have a strong belief that the new government has understood the scope and the importance of the monitoring exercise, as well as the urgency to deliver concrete results in the first semester of 2005.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view we have reason to be cautiously optimistic as regards Romania’s preparation for accession. Let us have a fair game. The jury is still out and it is now time to give Romania the benefit of the doubt in terms of its preparations for accession as a fully-fledged member state of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before concluding, let me briefly touch upon the financial implications of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, to which Mr Smith referred in his speech. Commissioner Grybauskaitė has worked closely with the two rapporteurs Mr Böge and Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, my former colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control. The Commission’s position on the matter is as follows. The amounts agreed in the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania for the period 2007-2009 are included in the Accession Treaty. The financial perspective for 2007-2013 is to be broken into broad categories of expenditure for the EU-27, not on distinctions of allocations between certain groups of Member States, some of which can only be very indicative anyway. The Commission believes that distinguishing indicative amounts by certain groups of Member States is not in line with the spirit and the letter of the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, both the European Commission and our financial assistance programmes will continue to support the efforts of the two countries to intensify their necessary preparations. The timely signature of the Accession Treaty is important with a view to sustaining the momentum and ensuring the successful preparation for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. I count on your support in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am very touched by what Mr Schmit said, on behalf of the Council, about the EU’s social values. It is in the light of those values of the EU that we should view this enlargement. There is no doubt that Romania and Bulgaria should, in time, form part of the European Union, but from the point of view of agriculture and the Committee on Agriculture, I have to conclude that there is no sign of the funding having yet been sorted out. It is a complete mystery how we will be funding the accession of those two countries. I would remind you of the social rights you mentioned and the values we uphold. I assume that it is not the Council’s intention that the 25 current Member States’ rural areas should fund this accession. That is inconsistent with the EU’s high values and so I assume that the Council will pay cash on the nail.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second point concerns the functioning of those countries in a new European Union. The Commission was right to raise questions about border control. I would note that our excellent food safety policy has enabled the European Union to achieve a high standard, and that is an area in which Romania leaves a great deal to be desired. You have to realise that, if we were required to take a decision now, large parts of Romania would not be able to join the common European market when the time comes, while we do sell products on their market; the fact that 30% to 40% of the population still lives in the countryside and has to make a living from it means that Romania is not far enough advanced in this area. I may be putting it bluntly, but honesty compels me to do this if I study the countryside’s social structure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to congratulate Bulgaria on its reform programme and on what it has done about ownership rights. It has also managed to make a good job of implementing its rural development programme, in contrast to Romania, which I have to criticise for failing to spend sufficient SAPARD funds to get rural development underway. It would therefore be valuable if Parliament were to have some extra time to take a decision, because the new government has made a good start, but results are at present thin on the ground. Those who draw a comparison with previous accessions must be realistic. Bulgaria is moving towards the ten countries that joined most recently, but Romania is lagging behind in respect of rural development, agricultural policy, the risk of animal diseases and legislation in the area of food safety. That helps determine our European values which we hold dear, which we uphold, and which, in our view, benefit society, provided we can enforce them. Unfortunately, at the moment, I have to conclude that there are many points of criticism to be made about Romania in terms of its agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, tomorrow will be a very important day for this Parliament, for Romania, for Bulgaria and for all EU citizens. We will effectively be approving the signature of the Accession Treaty for both countries; this will conclude the process of the fifth enlargement, south-eastern Europe will gain in terms of stability and progress and also the dream of reunifying Europe will become a reality.</p>
      <p sl="es">The opinion on Romania that we will vote on tomorrow is consistent with the first Moscovici report, approved by this Parliament last December. In it we said yes to the timetable established for the accession of Romania and we called for the implementation of a series of reforms in well-known areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">This opinion is also consistent with this Parliament's desire to remain closely involved in the process leading to accession in January 2007. I am talking about the monitoring of reforms and also this Parliament's desire to remain involved in the event of the activation of the so-called safeguard clauses.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, I am pleased that the Commissioner, Mr Rehn, has repeated his commitment to fully involve Parliament in the rest of the process until January 2007 and I also take note of the commitments made in this regard by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are crucial times in the history of Romania, of course. I would like to emphasise the immense support amongst the Romanian people for the integration of its country into the Union. It is an historic objective which has enormous support amongst the Romanian citizens and is also supported by the political forces in that country. I have witnessed this once again this morning in a meeting with distinguished parliamentarians from several Romanian political parties.</p>
      <p sl="es">I trust that the Romanian authorities, stimulated by this broad support, will continue to comply with the commitments in the Accession Treaty with complete determination and rigour, as Mr Rehn has just explained to us.</p>
      <p sl="es">The time has come for Romania to join Europe. This is the priority and I hope that tomorrow Parliament will express its confidence that the Romanian Government will meet these expectations and thus issue its favourable opinion. Parliament will follow Romania’s progress towards integration very closely. It deserves to be in the Union, not just because of its history, its geography and its culture, but also because of its European will and conscience.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, tomorrow, this House will be delivering its verdict on Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union. We are still 20 months away from the currently planned date of accession, though, and quite a few of the questions which have been discussed at length in this House remain unanswered. Our key concern is the state of affairs in Romania. A number of necessary reforms in public administration and the administration of justice must be carried out as a matter of priority. The fight against corruption deserves more decisive action, and better guarantees are needed for the freedom and independence of the press. These aspects, along with many others, have been mentioned in Commission reports and those of our own rapporteurs. Like the Council and the Commission, we want to keep the pressure on in Bulgaria and particularly in Romania, so that the necessary reforms can actually take place within the agreed timeframes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The shortcomings in Romania are so severe that our ‘yes’ at the moment amounts to conditional consent. There is still the option of activating the safety clauses in order to protect the European Union against the adverse effects of possible shortcomings. Should either country’s shortcomings be too serious, then its accession can even be postponed. As this House should not simply stand by during monitoring and during the process of deciding whether to use safeguards or to postpone accession, we have asked the Council and the Commission to be actively involved in the monitoring and decision-making process right up to the day of accession, and the speeches we have heard this afternoon indicate that they are prepared to do so. This puts the European Parliament in a better position and, above all, benefits democratic control of the enlargement process, and I also see it as a political agreement. Should a large majority of this House have cause to cast doubt over Romania’s or Bulgaria’s progress or state of readiness at a later stage in the process, then the Council and the Commission could hardly ignore it if they want to avoid major political confrontations. Our consent tomorrow will therefore be conditional. It is also a political agreement of some sort with the accession candidates. It sends a message to them that in the next 18 months, they will be high on our list of priorities, and that it is their own commitment that will eventually be decisive.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament will tomorrow be voting on whether or not to welcome Bulgaria into the European Union, and I would like to congratulate Mr Van Orden, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on his report on the subject, which is thorough and does a good job of striking a balance between, on the one hand, the enormous progress Bulgaria has made, and, on the other, the problems that still – as we know – remain to be resolved. What is beyond doubt is that the country is on the right road towards achieving membership of the European Union by 2007. Our group, that of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, will therefore be voting in favour of Bulgaria’s accession, and will be assuring the country of its critical but constructive support as it continues on its way.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Bulgarian Government has proved itself capable of fulfilling the accession criteria and of credibly complying with the demands made of it. This positive momentum must continue to be maintained in future, and, with elections due to be held in June, must not be allowed to slow down efforts at reform, particularly with regard to matters already referred to, such as the privatisation of Bulgartabak and the reform of criminal law.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is true to say that this is a significant day for the European Union, and so I would like to make use of this opportunity to say something about the fundamental characteristic of the forthcoming enlargement round for the European Union as a whole; I refer to the actual compliance with the performance criteria set out in the report. The European Union’s credibility – on which depends the necessary public support not only for the accession process, but also for the work of the European Union as a whole – must be maintained, and it will be so only by the consistent assessment of the candidates for accession, based on their own performance and their own merits. It is for this reason alone – and this I say for Mr Moscovici’s benefit – and not out of any doubt about the European prospects of the two candidates, that my group regards the individual assessment of candidates as so fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this respect, the consistent line taken by the Commission is to be welcomed. Commissioner Rehn has made it clear that he will not hesitate to recommend the application of the safeguard clause if he thinks it appropriate. We will see to it that what he has announced he will actually do if the need for it becomes apparent. My group is glad that this House will have a full part to play in this. I also believe – particularly having seen the inglorious behaviour of many Members of the Group of the European People’s Party this lunchtime – that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in December last year, my group voted against Mr Moscovici’s report because we felt that it took far too positive a view of Romania and that there was no indication whatsoever to suggest that the fundamental problems would be addressed, such as fighting corruption and guaranteeing independent media and a free press. I will be quite honest: if Mr Nastase’s party had won the elections in December last year, then it would have been quite straightforward for my group. We would be voting ‘no’ tomorrow against Romania’s accession. Romania’s old government was part of the problem rather than of the solution, but fortunately, there is now a new government whose priorities are in line with this Parliament’s concerns. Since this new government came into office, it has made it clear that it is serious about tackling the very problems that I mentioned a moment ago. Since then, former ministers and former members of parliament have lost their immunity from prosecution. Twenty-five high-ranking police chiefs who are suspected of corruption have been dismissed, and it is expected that criminal proceedings will be initiated against former ministers on account of corruption.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In short, this government, particularly the Justice Minister, deserves our support. I would like to say to all those who intend to vote ‘no’ that voting ‘no’ to this present government would be to penalise it for the old government’s mistakes. It would destabilise this government and if there is something I do not want, it is the old government back in power. To this government, then, I would urge you to say ‘yes’, but a conditional ‘yes’. It is crucial that this House continues to keep a grip on the enlargement with Romania and that is why I have taken the initiative to demand an undertaking from the Commission and the Council that this House will definitely continue to be involved in the enlargement, even after tomorrow. I am pleased with the rapporteur’s cooperation, and also pleased that cooperation with the Members of this House was a success. I am particularly pleased with the undertaking Mr Rehn gave today, which was also included in a letter by Mr Barroso to Mr Borrell.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Should it prove necessary in future, in the next 18 months, to refer to the postponement clauses, Parliament will have full involvement in this. If this House is of the opinion that too few reforms are being carried out in 2005 or 2006, and that it is therefore necessary to start the postponement procedure in very specific areas, including the fight against corruption, that is then possible and that then creates a political fact which will require a reaction from the Commission and the Council at European and at national level. After all, we should not overlook the fact that the Treaty with Romania and Bulgaria will be subject to ratification and that, in future, their parliaments will be taking into account what is said in this House.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My, or rather our, message to the new government is: yes, we will give you the benefit of the doubt. By all means, continue carrying out reforms, but bear in mind that this House will continue to monitor you with a very critical eye and, as the Commissioner already stated, we will not hesitate to avail ourselves of the postponement procedures should this prove necessary.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania were not immediately admitted during the large enlargement round in 2004 because negotiations with those countries were falling behind.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The point I would like to make about Bulgaria is that it indulges in building large roads and airports without giving any consideration to public health, nature, the environment or current EU rules. In addition, the large Roma population, despite projects subsidised by the European Union, is far from being treated on an equal footing. Poverty and unemployment are rampant. The current government is in power thanks to the temporary popularity of one person: the man who wanted to be king but does not have any organised and cohesive backing to speak of. This strange situation will probably come to an end after the elections of 25 June. Since Bulgaria is no worse than some states that were admitted in 2004, that criticism cannot be a good enough reason to wait any longer than 2007.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Romania’s membership is much more controversial. In recent years, there were no guarantees for the independence of the press, justice and non-governmental organisations. Although Romania has signed up as candidate member of the European Union, I get the impression that it has a higher regard for the US and Turkey. Romania is in such a bad state that neighbouring Moldova’s initial eagerness to return to it has completely evaporated. Government tasks have been neglected, but room has been created for a wild-west economy. In a bid to extract minerals cheaply, the country hires foreign freebooters who use dangerous chemicals which can seriously pollute the soil, groundwater and river water. In neighbouring Hungary, which has previously been hit by toxic river water from Romania, people are anticipating with fear the gold extraction project in Rosia Montana in the Romanian province Alba, which will involve the use of cyanide. Moreover, Romania has concluded an agreement with the United States to sabotage the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Romania is US Defence Minister Rumsfeld’s shop window of the ‘new Europe’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Romania’s performance is worse than that of any of the countries that have been admitted to date. That could, in itself, be a reason to reject Romania’s membership for the time being. My group, however, defends the right of European countries with a low standard of living to join the European Union quickly, provided they waste no time in complying with requirements in terms of human rights, democracy and the environment. Romania’s unconditional admission would make it more difficult to bring pressure to bear on Turkey to become a decent democratic country before being admitted to the European Union. Moreover, it takes away any serious argument to delay negotiations even further with the former Yugoslav republics Croatia and Macedonia, which had hoped to join at the same time as Romania. We do not know what Romania’s short-term development will be like under a new government; nor do we know whether a solution to the existing problems is in sight. That is why it is appropriate that the option of postponement should continue to exist as a lever. Not only the Council, but also this House, should possess that prerogative.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Thank you, Mr President, Mr Moscovici’s report on Romania’s application to join the European Union excels because of its clarity and honesty. It covers both the results and shortcomings in this crucial phase of Bucharest’s long and arduous road to Brussels. In paragraph 6, the rapporteur underlines the European obligations that the Romanian Government has not yet met. Not for nothing do judicial and administrative reforms, as well as the fight against corruption feature so high on that list. According to a well-informed spokesperson, we should in any event not doubt the integrity and commitment of the new Romanian Justice Minister, Mrs Monica Macovei, although she meets with much resistance even within her own ministry. I would welcome the open expression of support to her on the part of the Commission. Such a positive message could even have a double effect through being received both in Romania and elsewhere. I therefore also endorse what Mr Lagendijk had to say on this subject. In addition, the Commission could prompt the Romanian Government to launch a new drive against corruption in imitation of the ‘No backhanders to anyone’ campaign, for, in the final analysis, this evil affects the whole of society.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I sincerely hope that Mr Moscovici’s report contributes to Romania, deo volente , joining the European Union as a responsible member on 1 January 2007. In fact, I would express the same wish with regard to Mr Van Orden’s excellent report on Bulgaria.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important for Bulgaria and Romania to be able to assume obligations deriving from membership of the European Union. In the same way it is important for the European Union, so that enlargement does not pose risks to the Union itself.</p>
      <p sl="lv">In view of the situation in Transdniester and in the Balkans, especially regarding issues such as smuggling and trafficking in people, it is important that external borders fully conform to European Union standards. That is why I also proposed that the European Parliament resolution should call upon the Romanian and Bulgarian Governments to pay particular attention to the security of the new external borders. The Committee on Foreign Affairs has supported my proposal.</p>
      <p sl="lv">As a representative of Latvia, I am clearly aware of the huge amount of work that states have to accomplish and what important decisions they have to take, particularly in the final years before joining the European Union. Romania and Bulgaria have made considerable reforms on the path towards European Union membership. In my view, it is now important not to slow down the speed that has been taken and to continue the reforms that have been begun, paying particular attention to domestic affairs and the improving of the legal system, observance of human rights, and especially, and I would like to give this point particular emphasis, the combating of corruption, as well as the guaranteeing of secure external borders for the European Union. The reforms in Romania and Bulgaria will have a positive influence not only on the welfare of the citizens of these countries but also on development in the western Balkans. I would like to draw particular attention to the situation in the neighbouring state of Moldova, where, as a result of Bulgaria and Romania becoming European Union Member States, the values of peace, stability and prosperity might be translated into reality in the near future. In connection with Bulgaria and Romania I believe that we should look ahead to the future constructively. If some issues are still not settled, the support that is needed must be provided in order that they may be able to fulfil the legal requirements from the first days of membership. The European Parliament’s political support for Romania and Bulgaria will only reinforce these countries’ determination and will serve as political capital for the active continuation of reforms.</p>

      <p sl="es">Having said this, Mr President, according to the statements made here today, the European Parliament's powers remain intact so that, if necessary, it can play the role it deserves, and in the mean time I would insist that tomorrow we must approve the favourable opinions expressed here today with all the reservations, which I believe to be sufficient.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, we have almost reached the conclusion of a process which, for Bulgaria, has been a very long one. The path that leads to membership of the extended family of the EU has been regarded by Bulgaria as a priority, a priority that has spanned several governments, supported by popular mandate. The decision that now lies in our hands continues the reunification of Europe that was initiated two years ago by the European Parliament in this very same building in the case of the ten new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This enlargement enables us to extend the domain of stability, peace and prosperity to Romania and Bulgaria. It enables us to spread the values of Europe, which is based on democracy, pluralism and the rule of law. As Mr van Orden mentioned in his balanced report, Bulgaria still has some work to do to fulfil its obligations. Also, as Commissioner Rehn, Mr Wiersma, and other honourable colleagues have mentioned, I am delighted that Parliament will play its part in monitoring the preparatory process in future too. This is why I would like to call upon our Bulgarian friends to continue the excellent work which they began a good many years ago and which will enable us to conclude this period on 1 January 2007.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On behalf of the PSE Group, I would like to say that we are ready to welcome the people of Bulgaria into the association to which they have always belonged, since they share our history, culture and values. In so doing, we mark the end of an artificially created break, just as in the case of Romania. I am also delighted to be able to take this opportunity to say a few words about Romania as a Hungarian MEP, because I believe that this enlargement will provide a solution for the 2 million Hungarian people living in Romania, and that from 2007 onwards we will be able to live in a common Europe without borders.</p>

I would like to mention Baroness Nicholson, in particular, who has done this for Romania with unflagging zeal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As a large majority of my group will be consenting to the Accession Treaty with Romania, it is to this subject that I should like to devote my speech. Although there are still questions surrounding its state of readiness in the areas of justice, the fight against corruption and external border control, we appreciate and unreservedly support the major efforts the current government is making in order to catch up. I should also like to express our appreciation for the assurance which the Commission and the Council have given that Parliament will remain involved in subsequent progress that is yet to be made. In the past, cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, in the persons of either their shadow rapporteurs or their coordinators, has been exemplary and they have thus removed our biggest doubts. As you know, those doubts mainly concerned the long 20-month period that will separate the signing on 25 April next and the actual accession on 1 January 2007.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Having now been given the assurance that we, as an institution, will be involved in the possible activation of the safeguarding clause, we reiterate our full support to Romania, a country that currently has what it takes to ensure that this clause need not be resorted to.

The Bulgarian authorities must draw up a clear plan of action for combating people-trafficking and put it into practice. Conditions for patients in psychiatric homes must be improved. There is a need for further improvement in the integration of minorities, particularly of the Roma. Democratic rights and the free expression of opinion, as well as the principles of the Aarhus Convention and access to information must be guaranteed, for we have been shocked by the threats made to representatives of environmental NGOs and citizens’ initiatives.

The necessary requirements must be met, of course, but these countries should then be given the chance to demonstrate that they have something to contribute to the EU, particularly since there have recently been increasing signs that countries will join the EU in future that are situated rather further away from Europe as such. Waiting at the gates of the EU is a powerful motivation, and evidence of this can be found in the increasing levels of activity in Bulgaria and Romania. What is more, we should not forget that Bulgaria and Romania belong to the Balkans. I believe that there is a far greater chance of peace in this region if the two countries belong to the EU than if they do not.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at its most recent meeting in Brussels the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted by a clear majority to support the applications by Bulgaria and Romania for membership of the European Union. The members of the Independence and Democracy Group within the Committee on Foreign Affairs were among those who voted to support the applications, as we have no intention of thwarting the ambitions of these two European countries to be integrated with the rest of Europe. We are well aware that Bulgaria and Romania have made huge progress in terms of political and economic reform, yet at the same time we feel it is our duty to warn the citizens of these two countries against being overly optimistic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Although official Commission documents state that one of the goals of the European Union is to enhance solidarity among its peoples whilst respecting their history, culture and traditions, this is in fact far from the truth. Solidarity is no longer a priority for the European Union, and what really counts is a peculiar brand of competitiveness that has been enshrined in the latest version of the Lisbon Strategy. The new EU Member States have not received enough funding, which means that current policies will result in even greater differences between regions and countries. There is a substantial risk that instead of receiving real development aid, Bulgaria and Romania will merely pay for the upkeep of the European Union’s bureaucratic structure through their contributions to the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret to have to say that today’s debate has been dominated by accountants and bureaucrats. It is for this reason that I was delighted to hear Mr Schmit, the Council representative, draw our attention to something that should in fact be obvious, namely that this is a truly historic moment, in particular for Bulgaria and Romania. The accession of these two countries will mean that the divisions created by the Yalta agreement, and that ran counter to European culture, tradition and justice, will at last be totally erased from the map. At the same time, the two countries we are welcoming into the European Union have traditionally belonged to European culture. When they gained independence over 100 years ago, they made great efforts to establish themselves as modern states in order to become part of Western European culture. There can be nobody here today who is not familiar with names such as Brancusi, Eliade and Carmen Sylva, a pseudonym used by the Romanian queen 90 years ago to publish extremely well-known writings.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Similarly, Bulgaria freed itself from Ottoman domination when it gained independence by inviting the Western European Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty to take its throne. A representative of this dynasty, the current Bulgarian Prime Minister, is now successfully leading Bulgaria into the European Union. We should welcome these countries and be glad that they are entering into our family of European nations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, during the European election campaign held in Austria less than a year ago, the major parties’ lead candidates, Mr Swoboda and Mrs Stenzel, were asked, by members of the public worried about the 10-country enlargement that was in progress at the time, what the situation was as regards future candidates for enlargement. Their reply was: ‘That is not a live issue right now.’</p>
      <p sl="de">Just how much this statement deceived the electorate – as it was intended to do – is apparent from these reports, if it was not already. Burying one’s head in the sand has become a matter of consistent policy, for the arguments in favour of stopping these premature additional accessions are growing in number: corruption, administration, the fact that the story of the EU’s Constitution is not yet over. We ourselves are not in a position to take this step.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we, in this House, are supposed to be adopting tomorrow is, in terms of enabling Europe to function and actually be democratic, irresponsible and will end up being to the detriment of the countries that are now pressing to be admitted to the EU.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – I am glad to see you here, even if you are not listening – Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in our role as MEPs, there are two things we have to examine, and the first is whether the enlargement process safeguards our rights as such. As my group’s spokesman in the Committee on Budgets, which yesterday evening unanimously adopted the Dührkop Dührkop report, I can tell you that, as I see it, no account has been taken of the European Parliament’s budgetary rights in connection with this enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, your saying, ‘I will consider a request of the European Parliament’ is not, for me, a binding statement with which we can do anything in legal terms. Nothing is guaranteed. It is clear to me, when I analyse what is going on here, that due heed is not actually being paid to this House’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we have to examine whether or not Bulgaria and Romania comply with the criteria for accession. When, if not at the vote prescribed as mandatory by the Treaty, which is to be held tomorrow, are we meant to make a statement about this? Am I supposed to call to mind what this House has said, year in and year out, in the progress reports, particularly with regard to the situation in Romania? I can find no evidence of progress having been made. If I try to scroll forward to the end of 2006, I cannot envisage the goal being reached. I had proposed that we in this plenary should vote on Bulgaria’s and Romania’s applications for accession only after the next progress report had been presented to us, but that, unfortunately, has not proved possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">So let me make it abundantly clear – and I can say this also on behalf of a number of Members from my own country – that we cannot, at present, give our approval, particularly where Romania is concerned.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to begin with warm thanks to the rapporteurs for the very careful and comprehensive work that they have done. These reports are very frank, one consequence of which may be that they appear to be more critical than ought to be the case, but it is right that these things should be mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, for both Mr Schmit and Commissioner Rehn have made a considerable effort to accede to Parliament’s wishes and take on board its ideas. I know that they had many legal obstacles to overcome. Whilst I endorse in principle what Mr Ferber said about Parliament’s rights, it is clear from what the President-in-Office and the Commissioner have said today that it does not appear possible to them that the Council and the Commission should simply disregard any explicitly negative position delivered, in the autumn, by Parliament, which is the representative of Europe’s peoples. It was in fact on the basis of that alone that many of our Members feel able to vote in favour.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is still much to be done. Contrary to what was said by Mr Lagendijk – for whom, let me add, I have high regard – it is not the case that everything was formerly black or red or in any case bad, while everything is now fine. The former government, too, did a certain amount – too little, I admit – and so we have high hopes of its successor stepping up its efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was myself in Romania a week ago last Friday and was able to see how seriously the government and the various members of parliament are taking the implementation of reforms. With reference to the combating of cross-border crime, let me add that Romania’s efforts are gaining strength from what is now happening in Ukraine, from which we are for the first time getting a positive response. I would ask the Council and the Commission to take great care that Ukraine helps Romania to win this battle against international crime, and if the fight against corruption in Romania itself is won, it is very likely that the battle will in fact be won. I would, though, ask both of you to take this, and our views, as very seriously as we take your promises.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe also wishes to complain in the strongest terms about the lack of respect for Parliament and the violation of the European Parliament’s budgetary powers that we are seeing here in connection with the negotiations concerning the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU. Unfortunately, it is not the first time this has happened. We of course saw the same thing in connection with last year’s enlargement to include the ten new countries. Here, too, the Council acted entirely unilaterally in writing the estimated costs of enlargement into the annex to the Accession Treaties. One would think that what happened afterwards and the subsequent negotiations between Parliament and the Council would have stuck in the Council’s mind. The indications are, however, that the Council has a pretty short memory.</p>
      <p sl="da">How hard can it be? All we asked was that the Council – as agreed with the Luxembourg Presidency – make a joint declaration emphasising that the three institutions must reach agreement on the financial consequences of accession by Bulgaria and Romania, just as they should do. But no: it does not want to sign such a declaration. This is a clear illustration of an unwillingness to cooperate and comes such a short time before we must get in step as regards an agreement on the financial perspectives for the multiannual budgets for the years following 2006. The lack of a joint approach could have particular consequences, here; that is to say, if agreement on financial perspectives is not reached before the current perspectives expire.</p>
      <p sl="da">I should like to thank the Commissioner for detailing the status of the financial perspectives and for his support for the presentation of Parliament’s opinion. I should also like to thank Mr Schmidt for his promise that he will once again attempt to get the joint declaration signed by the Council. I wish him the best of luck with this task.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something else about Kosloduj. My group’s expectation is that this power station be decommissioned in the manner laid down in the protocol agreed on the subject. We had the impression that, on this point, the Van Orden report could well be clarified, as Mr Van Orden left this very much open. I am very glad of support from Mrs Stenzel and Mr Swoboda, which I trust will be backed up by broad support for this amendment on the part of their groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">I learned yesterday that the Bulgarian Government has now come to a final decision to build a new power station at Belene, and on this, too, we have submitted an amendment. Bulgaria is a major exporter of electricity. I cannot see that there is any need to continue with building work at Belene, thereby bringing hazards into the country and sending electricity out of it. To my mind, that does not make sense, and nor does the investment of European money in it. My colleague Mr Horáček has made reference to the great difficulties that citizens’ rights activists face at Belene in particular. It is not a good sign when Greenpeace International reports that opponents of nuclear power in Bulgaria face such extreme attacks that they need personal protection.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, is the question which arises whenever new countries join merely numerical and financial? In other words, is it only a question of cost, deficit, growth and production or is it also a cultural question? Is it perhaps also a social question? Romania and Bulgaria clearly do not have the European rate of growth or social justice. They lost forty-five years, which we signed away when we sent them to the Soviet Union. Roosevelt and Churchill both put their signatures alongside that of Stalin. We therefore owe them forty-five years' backlog in social development and economic growth. We must now therefore give them back what we owe them without grumbling; we must stretch out our hand and pull them into European society. We owe it to the civilisation, to the culture of Europe. Let us not only look at the dry figures. Dry figures are for technocrats. Numbers do not build republics, they build banking institutions, but we here are building the European republic, the European idea. Let us therefore vote in favour, because it is necessary for the breadth of Europe, it is necessary for these new ideas with which we need to endow Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Since 1989, all successive Romanian Governments have set as their sole and overriding aim the country’s accession to the European Union. The path has been tortuous and difficult, but there is no doubt that significant progress has been made. Above all, in recent years the Bucharest Government has made great strides. The Commission is aware of this and, in its 1997 report on compliance with the political criteria, acknowledged the huge reform efforts made by that country – the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and respect for minorities, as well as reforms in the area of public administration. Problems undoubtedly still exist, but we must have confidence.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Romania and Bulgaria are European countries. The aftermath of the Second World War was very unfortunate, and the accession of these countries to the European Union will not only be a form of reparation for the catastrophic Yalta Agreement, but will also satisfy the wishes of a great many people, Pope John Paul II included. It is irrelevant whether these countries join the EU on 1 January 2007 or at a later date, as even if we waited 40 years they would still not be ready in economic and social terms. Yet the genuine desire to build a common and just Europe on the basis of a Christian heritage is our key criterion, and I would therefore suggest that Romania and Bulgaria should join the EU on 1 January 2007, and no later. We should not dampen their pro-EU zeal, in fact we should be doing quite the opposite. We should put it to good use to ensure that the last reforms needed before accession are carried out.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament’s delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee visited Bucharest last week. We held meetings with our parliamentary colleagues, the new Head of State, the Prime Minister and other ministers. Our overall impressions were favourable. Even on the Romanian side there was no attempt to hide the problems which still exist, a fact I view as highly positive as it enables us to assess the efforts made to date.</p>
      <p sl="it">A short time ago, a fellow Member stated that these countries have not made any progress. That is simply not true. Romania and Bulgaria have made enormous strides. With particular reference to Romania, especially in the last few months following the change of government after the November elections, this progress has responded to recent requests from the European Parliament – for example when this House adopted Commissioner Verheugen’s report last November. I believe the European Union must be consistent: it would be genuinely strange to have to explain to Romanian and Bulgarian public opinion that their countries may become hostages to the inability of the Council and Parliament to find a consensus on issues concerning the budget and financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe sincerely that we must take notice of the great commitment made by these countries. There will be no shortcuts; achievement of the standards necessary for accession depends solely on their own efforts. However, we cannot jeopardise a priori the goal which these countries are striving to achieve.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having been in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the European Union from the word go, I still support their accession, and will continue to do so. I am delighted at the progress that both countries have made over recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, however, Parliament is being asked to vote in favour of Accession Treaties when the negotiations on these treaties have not been brought to a proper close. There are key aspects of the Copenhagen criteria that have not been met, and, by threatening to use the safeguard and postponement clauses, the Commission and the Council have revealed the political bankruptcy of the negotiations. To all intents and purposes, we are being asked to agree to an artificially propped-up accession.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, however, the Council is pushing for the treaties to be signed in a hurry, and snubbing Parliament by nullifying its budgetary rights. We should not punish Romania and Bulgaria for this, though, and the exchange of letters between Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and Mr Borrell, the President of Parliament, has at least made it possible for us to cast our votes in favour, even though we are far from happy at having to do so.</p>
      <p sl="de">The President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner should, however, be aware that we are rapidly losing our faith in the willingness and ability of the Council and the Commission to conduct the forthcoming enlargement negotiations in the necessary fashion, or in other words fairly, responsibly and in the interests of everyone. I would advise you not to rely on this House’s constant forbearance and, above all, would ask you to confirm to the House in November, when you submit your report, that the countries are ready to join, rather than presenting yet another interim assessment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in Helsinki in 1999 the Council, the Commission and Parliament tasked Romania with three key topics she had to address.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can report most favourably on one topic today: the progress on children’s rights. Since that date, the Commission has dedicated EUR 60 million to the implementation of children’s rights. The Commission, with the Romanian Government, has created family-style care for children in need through the implementation of day-care centres, family-type homes, mother and baby units and centres for special needs children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Year on year, the Commission has run a major public awareness campaign with the government and has set in hand and implemented large training programmes for professionals on the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and on the exceptionally powerful new Romanian legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result, the number of children in residential care has dropped from 85 000 to 35 000. Conditions in institutions have changed dramatically and 15 000 children are now in foster care. Some 30 000 children have been reintegrated into their own families. Only last year, 1 800 children were adopted domestically and two or three years ago 25 000 special needs children were restored to normal schooling for the very first time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has worked powerfully on new legislation for 6.5 million children in Romania. That new law is well in advance of other laws in the region and indeed of some nations in the European Union. It is a very modern law. It supports the family; it is against violence towards children and it forbids the institutionalisation of children between nought and two years old. In European Union Member States, there are many thousands of children in institutions, including between the ages of nought and two years old.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards contact between parents and children, the new law is particularly strong and very modern. The Commission set up a special group from Member States, led by a Belgian judge, to assist in the formation of this new legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, Romania now has more advanced law and greater reform on children’s rights than many of the Member States, as some Member States announced in a meeting on Friday 8 April in Greece. I congratulate Romania. This is just one success and there are many others. Romania has well earned her place in the European Union and I shall be delighted to vote for her accession.</p>

We ask them to open up the files and finally explain to Europe what really happened and who it was that supplied the weapon to Ali Agca, a man trained in Bulgaria. We are asking what happened because there are still people with the blood of that attack on their hands, placing a heavy burden of responsibility on the leaders of that period of history, which is fortunately now behind us since the collapse of the Berlin wall.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, according to the advocates of enlargement, the Balkans would become more stable if Romania and Bulgaria were to join the European Union in a little under two years’ time. There is no doubting their status as members of the European community of nations, and Austria in particular welcomes the prospect of the EU being enlarged to include large swathes of a country that was an integral part of the Austrian family of nations before the First World War. At the same time, however, this does not alter the fact that both countries continue to face serious problems which have not yet been resolved in spite of all the efforts towards reform, and which are not confined to the economic and social spheres. Romania and Bulgaria are also experiencing major problems relating to the export of crime, a far from negligible cause of which is corruption within these countries. What is more, given that 30% of Romanians still live on the poverty line, there is a risk that the EU labour market will come under immense pressure.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our opinion, the above-mentioned problems are evidence that it may well be too early for Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU. Romania and Bulgaria – that is, the authorities in Sofia and Bucharest – will have to get on top of the fight against crime before they are granted entry into the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, when I assent tomorrow to the accession of a Romania that is able to comply with and apply European norms and practice, I am doing so while drawing attention to the importance of being able to keep track of how commitments are being honoured.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Romania has undergone a great transformation in the past fifteen years. In a short period of time it has changed from a backward country quite literally shrouded in darkness, and a brutal dictatorship, into a NATO member and a candidate for EU membership. Hopefully, thanks to its new government, the foundations of a system genuinely based on the rule of law will also be laid in the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Alongside the successes, however, the transition is also hampered by some unresolved issues. As a Hungarian MEP, I must point out particularly the numerous transitional exemptions requested by Romania in the field of environmental protection, some of which have a direct impact on the state of Hungary’s natural environment. Sensitive, unresolved matters include corruption, the independence of the judiciary, restitution of church and community property, the issue of the State Hungarian University, the cultural rights of the Csango people, initiatives by the Hungarian community and the Székely region to achieve autonomy, and provisions in the electoral legislation – also criticised by international organisations – that discriminate against minority organisations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We cherish hopes of progress in these areas too in the coming months. This moment is a historic one for the citizens of Romania and for the Hungarian community in Transylvania, which is of special importance to me. I believe that accession will strengthen the ability of the one-and-a-half million indigenous Hungarian minority to shape its future and provide a chance of achieving self-government, autonomy and independence. By approving the signing of the Accession Treaty, we are giving Romania an opportunity. This is why I would like to place particular emphasis on strict monitoring during the period between the signing of the Accession Treaty and the actual accession date. The European Parliament must have a role in this process so that everyone’s misgivings can be allayed by the time the actual accession date arrives.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Working in the European Parliament has made it clear to me that the future shape of Romania, including that of the Hungarian community, depends on us in many respects. Let us be decisive in calling Romania to account, even if the delegation of the government in power at any given time is otherwise inclined, because covering up problems would have a demoralising effect on the population of the Member States. This is particularly important for the citizens of Romania, whose only concern must be to emerge as the winner from accession. This is what my yes-vote is about. Let it be a chance for these people.</p>

      <p sl="cs">A year will soon have passed since the historic enlargement, when ten new Member States joined the EU. It is apparent that the results of this enlargement have on the whole been positive, and that this is true not only for the Member States that became part of the European Union a year ago, but also for the old Member States. I am quite sure that the round of enlargement involving Romania and Bulgaria will be equally successful. The mere prospect of accession has proven to be a powerful motivation for both Romania and Bulgaria to reform their political systems and to implement a number of reforms relating to human rights and civil liberties, to the political system and to the building of a stronger economy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Much remains to be done, of course, and our rapporteurs have given a clear, unambiguous and extremely objective account of this in their reports. I believe that both Romania and Bulgaria will continue to be as successful over coming months as they have been to date, and that they will be able to join the European Union in 2007. I am aware that there has been some controversy over the division of competences between the various European institutions, but we should not lose sight of our main goal, which is the further enlargement of an area of democracy, freedom, stability and prosperity. This area should be enlarged to include South-Eastern Europe, so that not only Hungary and the Czech Republic, but in future also Romania and Bulgaria, can set a strong and positive example to such countries as Serbia, Montenegro or the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like first to congratulate the two rapporteurs on their detailed reports. Last December, the European Council announced the completion of negotiations with the two countries with the assent of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which was absolutely clear. Today, we have also had statements by both the Council and the Commissioner, Mr Rehn. Everyone has pointed out that these two countries have made remarkable progress within the framework of their efforts to harmonise with the acquis communautaire . However, both these countries still need to do more, mainly on the chapters of corruption, justice and combating organised crime. These shortcomings, in my opinion, can be overcome in the period of over eighteen months remaining. Furthermore, the progress being made will be very closely monitored by the Commission, as Commissioner Rehn has stated. I should also like to point out that the amendment on the basis of which the European Parliament will take full part in the accession procedure of both these countries and in the decision-making process, in the event that safeguard clauses need to be used, is also very important because, to put it one way, it also safeguards control by Parliament. We Greek PPE-DE MEPs strongly support the integration prospects of Romania and Bulgaria, knowing full well that this will strengthen stability and security in the Balkans. We also believe that a negative result would send the wrong political message and would discourage these countries from making all the necessary efforts at a rapid pace.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, for Hungary, Romania’s accession is a matter of national interest given that, historically, Hungarian-Romanian relations have been fraught with conflict. The EU can provide a framework for resolving these conflicts definitively, but this will not happen automatically. Romania’s one-and-a-half million-strong ethnic Hungarian community has a keen interest in becoming a member of the EU as soon as possible; support for the EU within this group stands at over 90%. In a spirit of political good neighbourliness, Hungary would like to offer its assistance to the Romanian Government to enable the country to comply completely with the requirements set out in detail in the present report, so as to avoid postponement of Romania’s accession and ensure that the safeguard clause does not need to be invoked.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The work still to be done includes important areas such as creating genuine local self-governance and implementing genuine decentralisation. It is important that the European Parliament should remind the Romanian Government to continue improving the situation of the Hungarian minority, to implement special measures, and to emphasise the need for subsidiarity and local self-governance.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Self-governance is synonymous with autonomy, and a minority of one-and-a-half million people is in great need of it. I refer both to the need for personal, individual autonomy for Hungarians scattered throughout the country, and the need for territorial autonomy for areas densely populated by Hungarians. In this regard, Romania’s regions should be constituted on the basis of historical linguistic traditions. Thank you, Mr Moscovici, for your report. It provides great encouragement and considerable help to Romania’s minorities. With the aforementioned provisos, I wholeheartedly support the speedy accession of Romania.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I too took part in the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee visit to Bucharest last week and I am very grateful to the President of Parliament, and indeed to our Vice-President Mr Podestà, for making it possible, in extraordinary circumstances, to hold the vote this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main point I would like to report back to Parliament was how impressively open members of the Romanian Government – from the President to the Prime Minister to the ministers – were in recognising the difficulties that they have inherited. There was no attempt to cover them up. Yet in a very short space of time they have produced detailed programmes to deal with these difficulties, which they have also costed. So this was not just a wish list, it was a very practical approach to the difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know the issues involved: the fight against corruption, independence of the judiciary, the protection of the environment. It is very clear that the European Union will have to support Romania in terms of inward investment and cooperation in order to restore civil society. A look back at the history books and the pictures of Bucharest at the beginning of the last century show how prosperous and cultivated Romania was at that point in the society of European countries. It is my belief that Romania will rejoin Europe and deserves to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are concerns, particularly about the Hungarian minority in Transylvania, which was not treated well in the past; but I believe we received important reassurances on that count.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore I will be voting in favour. It is most important to give the right message not only to the Romanian authorities but also to the Romanian population. This is not the end of the story, of course; after accession we need to continue to work. But I would like to thank our Romanian hosts who welcomed us to Bucharest and also point out that the EU embassies – in other words representatives of the Member States – are working hand-in-hand with the Commission to make sure that this very difficult task is accomplished.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this House has always been in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU. Having repeatedly stated that this accession should take place on 1 January 2007, we would very much welcome a decision to this effect tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a member of the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee, I have seen for myself what progress this country has made, in spite of all the problems bequeathed by the Ceausescu regime. It cannot be denied, however, that Romania still has a great deal of work to do before its accession, including fighting corruption and securing the independence of the judiciary, to both of which reference has been made on many occasions. I am delighted to see that the new government is working to achieve these goals, and that national action plans have been produced for the period until 2007. Corruption amounts to nothing more than stealing from the national economy and from the people; it is an evil that must be eradicated from society.</p>
      <p sl="de">Romania must be a functioning state under the rule of law. No matter what problems are encountered with regard to filling senior posts in constitutional bodies, the constitution must be observed, and I would also note that Romania is a member of the European family and is not stepping out of line in any way. The idea of a Washington-London-Bucharest axis is perhaps somewhat presumptuous, but, as we look forward to this country joining us in the EU, I believe that it will cooperate effectively and well with us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, I welcome the progress made by Romania on its path towards membership of the European Union. In a short amount of time a lot has been achieved and I want to congratulate the Romanian authorities on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have heard this afternoon about the areas where more progress is required and our genuine concerns about how it will all be financed. Despite Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne’s very positive report on the improvement in childcare in Romania, the care of children and young adults in state institutions is an issue. I am talking particularly about those children and young adults with disabilities. Less than a year ago, Amnesty International launched a disturbing report on the tragic deaths of a number of patients in a psychiatric hospital in Romania. The report indicated that the deaths were mainly due to malnutrition and hypothermia and were sadly not an exception in the Romanian mental health care system.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that the European Union, working with the Romanian authorities, has been involved in very important work to reduce the number of children and young adults in institutionalised care. However, Amnesty International has pointed out that not enough account has been taken of the many young adults who have been inappropriately transferred from the state institutions that were closed down and have ended up in psychiatric hospitals, where they may well languish for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I accept that things have greatly improved in Romania. The Commission recently informed me of all its work in this regard, but a lot more remains to be done in this area. It is simply not acceptable that children and young adults in Romania are held in inappropriate care. Indeed, it is not acceptable that this should happen in any EU Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the accession of Romania to the European Union, but I would urge the Romanian authorities, the Commission, this Parliament and all relevant bodies not to forget the real people I am talking about: those who do not have a voice. Their situation needs to be carefully monitored and improved in the run-up to accession and thereafter.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture emphasises the political and economic importance of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that we have a serious problem in terms of the financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot deal with the Accession Treaties without taking account of the financial perspectives, particularly with regard to the common agricultural policy. We must take account of the financial cost of the application of the CAP in these two candidate countries. In the case of agriculture, we do not find it sufficient to say that the funding of these two countries will be carried out within the sums agreed by the Council. This agreement referred solely to the spending for the Union of 25 and only included the 10 new countries, and not Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
      <p sl="es">We in this Parliament want the agreements of the Brussels Summit of October 2002, which offered the assurance that the progressive introduction of new countries would be carried out within the framework of financial stability, to be respected.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to include these two new countries, something with which we agree, the sum calculated for that purpose must be increased in order to accommodate Romania and Bulgaria within the common agricultural policy. That is what Parliament wants and we hope that the Council and the Commission will both agree.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Romania and Bulgaria must become members of the European Union, but how is it going to happen and when is it going to happen? First of all I would have welcomed more willingness for cooperation on the part of the Council with respect to financing issues. We have heard here today that there is still a very great number of uncertainties, and that is why it would be preferable if we gave further consideration to what could be the common view on these issues.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In particular, we have problems with regard to Romania, and the questions is whether it fulfils all the criteria. If it is not a requirement for Romania to fulfil all the criteria, which all Member States have had to do so far, it will be a bad example to set for future new Member States, such as Turkey. I was pleased to hear Commissioner Rehn’s suggestion that the safeguard clauses must be applied, if the conditions are not adequately met and if Romania is not making sufficient progress. I strongly support this view.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now it would have been more sensible to wait for the next progress report and only vote on these issues then, not tomorrow. Above all, the question is about public trust in how the institutions follow rules and agreements. A short time ago the Stability and Growth Pact was watered down, because it was considered to be politically important. If membership criteria are now to be watered down, because it is considered politically important, it is difficult to imagine how the public can trust in these institutions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, while we support the reports that we are debating, we in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy wish to emphasise that in the research, energy, industrial policy and telecommunications sectors, both countries need to make additional efforts. They need to change their industrial policy; they need to eliminate the structural obstacles to investment and excessive bureaucracy and they also need to create a stable legislative framework to ensure an effective strategy for small and medium-sized businesses, the true creators of employment and source of technological innovation.</p>
      <p sl="es">They must also continue working on an energy safety policy. Bulgaria has already adopted measures to achieve a high level of safety at the Kozludy nuclear power station, and we are pleased about that. But energy generation capacities are expected to be considerably reduced, and it is therefore urgent to create new capacities and guarantee security of supply. We call on the Commission to monitor this issue closely and to provide any necessary technical assistance.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the case of Romania, the abandonment of inefficient thermal power stations and non-viable coal mines are key challenges that require the immediate adoption of social policy measures to deal with the serious difficulties created in terms of employment. For all these reasons, they need our support, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Romania has had difficulty casting off the yoke of the Soviet empire. Romania was one of the countries that experienced the most violent transition from dictatorship to democracy. The country has therefore had a more difficult journey towards membership. Consequently, the progress made by Romanian society is impressive, although the work is far from complete. Romania still has problems with infringement of the freedom of the press, poor safeguarding of the rights of the child and suppression of the Roma population, and there are also still problems involving corruption. I am therefore satisfied with the action plan on corruption published recently by the Romanian Government. Although Romania still suffers from serious problems, it is important that we approve Romania’s membership tomorrow since we want to encourage the efforts of the Romanian people to meet the conditions for accession on 1 January 2007.</p>

    <intervention id="2-220" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Schmit" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will be brief. Your debate has uncovered a number of very useful and very interesting pieces of information. I thought I detected, through all of the interventions, that Parliament is able to give broad support to the accession of these two countries, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Stop and think for a moment. If there had not been the prospect of accession for these two countries, where would they be today? Would they have developed in the way that they have? Would democracy have made the progress that it has done in these two countries? The prospect of accession, the prospect of becoming fully-fledged members of the European family, has acted as a powerful catalyst for the reform of these two countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, then, we should certainly not – as has been said – demoralise or discourage these two countries. That is why the road to accession should now be made tangible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also true that there are areas requiring improvement and action. Some of you mentioned the very serious issue of corruption. We need to urge the governments of the two countries – of one of them in particular – to fight even more effectively against corruption. We should encourage, even oblige, these governments to put in place more independent and more effective judicial systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am sure that the Commission will be more than an observer: it will take effective action; it will monitor developments in these countries; it will not take the easy option, as the Commissioner has plainly said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, today we must send out an important political signal to Bulgaria and Romania. We must have a degree of confidence in these two countries, while showing them that the way ahead is clear. The commitments must be respected. Moreover, that is why the safeguard measures laid down for these two countries differ slightly from those that were provided for at the last enlargement, and the differences are not purely stylistic. These are practical measures that can be applied. And they will be applied all the more effectively if your Parliament monitors developments in the two countries, as I am sure it will.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to comment on the doubts expressed in particular by Mr Hänsch about the Council’s willingness to listen to Parliament. I think that you made an important point. Parliament has always been a valuable ally in enlargement processes and the Council wishes to keep this ally with a view to future enlargements. Everyone is fully aware of this, and it is not empty words when the Council says clearly that full account will be taken of Parliament’s position if it expresses a view on the possible invoking of the safeguard measures. I therefore believe that you can be more reassured than you appear to be.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have already commented on the financing. I believe that the Presidency has one regret: not to have resolved the issue of the joint declaration more satisfactorily. But I would also reiterate what I said before: be quite sure that Parliament’s rights will remain intact, because they arise from the treaty, and Parliament’s rights will also remain intact in the context of the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-221" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Thank you for a very serious and substantive debate. You raised several concerns as to the two countries’ ability to fight corruption and in general to live up to the commitments made in the field of the environment, reform of the judiciary system or the rights of minorities. I share these concerns. That is why it is so important to sustain a positive momentum, to encourage these countries to stick to their reform agendas to the full.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will closely monitor progress and keep the European Parliament properly informed. If the Commission should find it necessary to recommend invoking the safeguard clause we will, as I said in my introductory speech, seriously consider the views of Parliament before issuing any such recommendation, in line with the exchange of letters between Presidents Barroso and Borrell.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to comment on the rights of minorities. In the case of Romania, there was reference to the situation of the Hungarian minority. We can note positive developments with regard to this issue, at the level of both the government and the citizens. The Hungarians became part of the governing coalition in 2004 and Prime Minister Tariceanu chose Budapest as his first destination for a state visit abroad. Moreover, since 2000, the Hungarians have gained significant rights in the administration, education and justice. In particular, it is provided by law that they have the right to express themselves in their mother tongue before the courts. Furthermore, in areas where the Hungarian population is above 20% – in more than 1 000 municipalities – the signs are bilingual.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Hungarian minority also enjoys educational facilities: the private Hungarian university, Sapientia, has more than 1 400 students. We welcome this positive trend and will continue to monitor the improvements in this area in our comprehensive monitoring report this autumn.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the situation of the Roma, another issue related to the rights of minorities, both Bulgaria and Romania have started to implement the national strategy on the improvement of the situation of the Roma, as set out in the Union’s PHARE Programme. Although the results are still limited, important progress has been made. In particular, the improved access to education and local projects for community development can be counted as successes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Roma Inclusion Decade was recently launched in Sofia, covering several current and future Member States and potential candidates. The Commission fully supports this important initiative. Moreover, we are following the situation of the Csango minority in Romania very closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, I wish to remind you that the need to ensure a high level of nuclear safety is a priority for the Union as a whole and its Member States. In this context, the need to close down certain nuclear facilities was highlighted in the case of three countries: Lithuania, the Slovak Republic and Bulgaria. The framework negotiated with Bulgaria is clear and it involves firm and unambiguous respect for the commitments regarding closure on agreed dates. The issue is settled; the case is closed; the dates for closure will not be discussed again.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I gather that there is general support for giving assent to the signature of the Accession Treaty with the two countries, in line with the arrangement outlined in President Barroso’s letter to President Borrell. In other words, the European Parliament is fully associated and the Commission is committing itself seriously to considering the views of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just say how I see the role of the European Parliament in regard to the postponement clause. I would call this an ‘extended assent’ vote, which is not legally binding because the Treaty does not allow that, but is certainly a weighty political statement once it has been made by the European Parliament. There are both quantitative and qualitative reasons for this. In the first place you have to vote more than 20 months before the accession takes place, which is exceptional. In the case of the EU-10, the period was around 12 months and in the case of the enlargement in 1995 it was roughly 6 or 7 months. That is very different from 20 months.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, numerous criteria, especially in the field of justice and home affairs, as well as competition, state aid and the environment, are included in the Accession Treaty itself. Therefore it is clearly important to monitor this process and ensure that it is democratic. This respects the spirit of the Treaty and European democracy, and it is very important that the European Parliament be fully involved in this decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are on the eve of a historic decision. I am very glad that we have had sound and productive cooperation with the European Parliament. I trust this will be a good omen for future cooperation. Now the final outcome is in the hands of the Romanians and Bulgarians. I hope they succeed and we will support them so that they will be ready to become fully-fledged Member States by January 2007.</p>

      <p sl="en">The accession of Bulgaria is really important for us, but it is more important for the women living there. This country has done some progress in the issue recently. Most of acquis in the area of equal opportunities have already been transposed, and the principals of non-discrimination and equal opportunities have a good juridical and a progressing institutional background.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there are still some problems. First of all, although these rules were introduced, their implementing and execution are lagging behind. A lot needs to be done in this issue.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission’s communication on the Integrated package: BEPGs and Employment guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I should like to welcome the Commissioners and now call upon Commissioner Verheugen to address Parliament.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-227" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Verheugen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a regrettable fact that, although five years have passed since the European Summit held in Lisbon in 2000, we are still a long way from reaching the goals set for the EU economy at the time. Growth rates have fallen far short of projections, and the number of new jobs created has not been enough to achieve the desired employment rates. Growth and employment are therefore priorities for the Barroso Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two months ago, we presented our proposal for a revision of the Lisbon Strategy, in favour of which Parliament had voted by an overwhelming majority. The key features of this revised Strategy include a clear definition of priorities and the establishment of a partnership between the Community and the Member States geared towards implementing the planned measures. The European Council approved the Commission’s proposals three weeks ago, which means that the stage is now set for us to implement our goals.</p>
      <p sl="de">The package we are presenting to the House today is the first phase of our implementation strategy. The proposal for integrated guidelines is a practical means of making the new Lisbon Strategy simpler, more transparent and more manageable in political terms. The guidelines for economic and employment policy, which have now been summarised in one document, are both a roadmap for more growth and employment and a basis for the Member States’ national Lisbon programmes. This is the crucial point; what we are establishing is a Community framework within which the Member States will be able to devise tailor-made national solutions to the problems that we have identified together.</p>
      <p sl="de">A first set of guidelines urges the Member States to continue pursuing stability-oriented macroeconomic policies. Given nearly all Member States’ experience of the problems associated with an ageing population, budgetary discipline is the only way to achieve long-term sustainability of public finances. We must make sure that public spending is targeted at activities that contribute to long-term growth, in particular in the fields of education, science and research.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second set of guidelines deals with structural reforms, the aim of which is to facilitate the transition to a more knowledge-based economy and to make Europe a more attractive place to work and invest in. I should like to elaborate on a number of structural guidelines that are of key importance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first of these is the internal market. We need an internal market that functions well, and this requires the removal of the remaining barriers to market access and a more rigorous implementation of competition policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we need better regulation, and there must be a systematic assessment of the economic, social and environmental impact of legislative proposals at both national and EU level. Legislation generates costs for businesses, and these costs can weigh particularly heavily on small businesses. It is for this reason that better regulation is one of the key building blocks of a business-friendly environment and a strong entrepreneurial culture.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point I wish to address is innovation. Europe’s future lies in knowledge-intensive and innovative sectors of the economy, and both the public sector and the economy itself must therefore step up investment in research. The guidelines call on the Member States to facilitate innovation by promoting technology transfer and establishing innovation clusters, as well as by encouraging the uptake of new technologies such as information technology. Innovations in the field of environmental technologies are a factor not only in boosting growth and employment, but also, and in particular, in achieving sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="de">The guidelines for structural policy are followed by a final set of guidelines for employment policy, which Mr Špidla will discuss shortly. Their aim is to create jobs, boost investment in education and skills, make the workforce and businesses more flexible and modernise social security systems. Particular attention must be paid to improving the situation of young people, since unemployment among this group is twice as high as among the general population.</p>
      <p sl="de">The full potential of these reforms will only be realised if they are implemented as a package, the individual components of which complement one another. Implementing all these measures will give a significant boost to growth and employment, and so we need a strong and solid partnership based on trust to drive forward these much-needed reforms. This must not and will not be a technocratic process; instead, it must be viewed as a highly political process, which will deliver results only if it is endorsed by European society as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">Your House will play a key role in this process, and it is crucial that we maintain the political momentum generated by the revision of the Lisbon Strategy and by the decisions taken by you and at the Spring Summit in Brussels. The time has come to capitalise on this momentum by taking the first steps towards implementation. The Commission would be most appreciative if Parliament could give particular and timely consideration to the guidelines that have been presented today.</p>

    <intervention id="2-228" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, following on from the speech the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, has just made, I would like to refer in particular to the content of the broad economic policy guidelines included in this document approved today by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Naturally, the broad economic policy guidelines, an instrument enshrined in the Treaty, together with the review of the Lisbon Strategy, have growth and employment as a priority: to grow more and to create more jobs in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Last week I presented the Spring economic forecasts, which are produced by the Commission’s services and, as you are aware, we believe that there will be a recovery during 2005, a revitalisation of economic growth, which will continue during 2006, and employment will be created, but it will not be sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">Growth must be more intense in order to create the necessary employment to allow us to achieve full employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">To this end, the macroeconomic chapter of these broad economic policy guidelines, which are integrated into the package approved today by the Commission, reiterate the need to establish stable economic conditions that can create confidence. Because confidence amongst consumers and economic agents is needed in order to increase consumer demand, in order to increase investments and in order to increase internal demand, and that is the basis that should lead us, with sustained recovery, to more growth, more employment opportunities and thereby to greater guarantees that we can preserve and enhance social cohesion and the sustainability of our model of growth and of society.</p>
      <p sl="es">Naturally, the broad economic policy guidelines for 2005-2008 take account of the review of the Stability and Growth Pact, based on the agreement reached by the Spring European Council, and, in this regard, they recommend avoiding pro-cyclic budgetary policies and maintaining the medium-term budgetary stability objectives throughout the economic cycle, and also taking account of the differing levels of indebtedness and the differing growth potential of each country when establishing those specific medium-term objectives.</p>
      <p sl="es">For the euro zone, the specific need is stressed for the countries that share the single currency to achieve those mid-term budgetary balance objectives, and those countries are called upon to pay special attention to fiscal discipline and their budgetary situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Vice-President Verheugen has just pointed out, the microeconomic chapter of the guidelines makes particular reference to the need to create the appropriate framework for attracting more investment to the internal market, to enhance innovation and, by means of greater investment, enhancing innovation, research and development and better functioning of the markets and increasing the growth potential of our economies.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, of course, this macroeconomic and microeconomic strategy, integrated into the broad economic policy guidelines, is consistent with the employment guidelines that my colleague, Commissioner Spidla, will explain next.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-229" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Špidla" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="cs">This new set of guidelines for employment policy represents a new beginning for the European Employment Strategy in the framework of the revised Lisbon agenda. The integrated guidelines are based on the premise that if the European Union wishes to create more and better jobs, it needs a range of interrelated measures that will make Europe more attractive and more innovation-friendly. These measures must apply not only to the labour market, but also to the market for goods and services and to the financial market, and structural reforms must be founded on a growth-oriented macroeconomic policy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">No real progress has been made in the area of employment in recent years, something that has mainly been due to sluggish economic growth associated with weak demand and global imbalances. After a period in the late 1990s when employment rose sharply, the number of new jobs has levelled off over the past three years, and the only reason why we have not suffered a drop in employment similar to that of 10 years ago is because the labour market is now more flexible. At the same time, growth in labour productivity has slowed, limited progress has been made towards improving the quality of work and the economic slow-down has exacerbated related problems of social inclusion, in particular among young people. Long-term unemployment rates have started to rise again after several years of decline.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We are facing major problems. On the one hand, Europe must rise to the challenge of accelerated economic restructuring on the basis of increased economic integration, both within the enlarged EU and on a global scale. If Europe wishes to succeed, it must improve its capacity to anticipate, bring about and cope with economic change. On the other hand, Europe needs to tackle the problems of an ageing population. Demographic changes mean that we must modernise our social welfare systems, and that our labour market must change and will have to adapt to an ageing and soon-to-be shrinking workforce.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Europe will only remain prosperous if it achieves faster growth in both employment and productivity. In order to do so, we need a new approach to life-long work and renewed efforts to develop human capital in Europe. The new set of guidelines for employment policy responds to these challenges and acts as a roadmap for the employment policies of the Member States, as well as reiterating the EU’s objectives of full employment, improved quality and productivity of labour and greater social and territorial cohesion. Emphasis is given to a number of key measures, which are targeted at three priorities. The first of these priorities is to ensure that more people enter and stay in employment, the second is making workers and businesses more flexible and the third is boosting investment in human capital. At the same time as implementing the guidelines, Member States must also implement the recommendations on employment policy, and commit themselves to fulfilling the full scope of the European Union’s ambitions and goals. It is also essential to continue putting the open method of coordination to full use in the field of social inclusion and social welfare, as outlined in the Social Agenda, and for the relevant parts of this strategy to be incorporated into the national Lisbon programmes. The European Social Fund must be directly utilised by means of support measures at Member State and regional level.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The preparations that are carried out in the run-up to the presentation of the national programmes in autumn 2005 must be used as an opportunity to win over all parties concerned to the cause of developing and implementing employment policy. The experiences gained with the European Employment Strategy in this regard were extremely positive, as the involvement of all affected parties helps the Member States to be more transparent and to formulate policies, as well as ensuring that policy measures are both legitimate and effective. This is the key feature of the new framework for growth and employment presented in the shape of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The European Parliament will, and indeed already does, play a key role in this process, not least by setting out its position on the guidelines for employment policy that the Commission proposes. I believe that these new guidelines for employment policy, which form part of the integrated package we are presenting on behalf of the Commission, adhere to the basic principles and new objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, namely growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I agree with a lot of what the Commissioners describe. The integrated package is a good thing. We have not been completely successful in recent years. This is true in relation not only to the young but also to the older work force, people with disabilities and people from other cultures.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I should like to address an issue linked to the second and third parts, namely structural changes. At present, we very often see structural changes as a threat, but I think that they ought to be seen as a challenge. Firstly, it is a question of whether we are to make full use of our human capital, that is to say train the work force. Secondly, it is a question of whether we are to have security in the labour market, because people made to feel secure can also participate in the work designed to produce change. Thirdly, it is a question of involving employees not only when something has happened, but throughout the whole process of change. It is then that there can be talk of influence in the work place. Do you have any comments on this, I wonder?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask the Commission why it is not encouraging employment, and why many young people are not being allowed to find work, by enabling older workers, who wish to retire as soon as possible, to leave their jobs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Although many workers would agree to retire with a lower pension, leaving jobs available for the young, current employment guidelines oblige older workers to remain at work even longer, thereby denying the young the possibility of a job.</p>
      <p sl="it">Could you explain the reason for this?</p>

      <p sl="nl">I would thank the Commissioners for this communication. I hope that the integration of the guidelines will lead to more cohesion. I have to say, though, that Lisbon was about three different aspects; there was also social cohesion, and as far as I am aware, social cohesion covers more than employment alone. It was also about driving back poverty substantially and about guaranteeing proper pensions. How will we, in the absence of the entire ‘social leg’, be able to prevent any forthcoming debate on pensions from once again becoming a debate on their fundability? That is my first question.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second question is procedural in nature. I have noticed that the Economic and Financial Affairs Councils will deal only with the economic dimension and the Social Affairs Council with the employment guidelines. This is not, to my mind, a good example of integration. Why do the two Councils not comment on the entire package?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would also like to know how exactly you, Commissioners, see Parliament’s role. Does this mean that we are now granted official advisory powers with regard to the economic guidelines as well?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission promised us that the new, integrated guidelines take on board the recent decisions on the Stability and Growth Pact. Commissioner, you promised that you do not support procyclical reform in the Member States, the level of public debt that is taken on board and so on. How will you make sure that the Member States do not interpret the changes to the Stability and Growth Pact in a very broad way, or introduce reforms that will actually broaden the concept of what can be calculated as excessive deficits and deficit calculations? There is a serious threat that many Member States will try to avoid making those necessary reforms and will interpret these watered-down Stability and Growth Pact decisions in the wrong way. I would like the Commission to be very tough on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my comments follow on from those of Mrs Van Lancker. A closer look reveals quite clearly that this is a pseudo joint paper, or, to put it another way, that it is falling apart at the seams. It is by no means clear whether these will be joint efforts, or in other words whether attempts will in fact be made to improve social policy in all areas. It is also far from clear whether the employment goals that have been set have any relevance at all now, as it is certainly true that the 2000 figures have ceased to apply.</p>
      <p sl="de">Gender mainstreaming is a key concept that should underpin all policies, yet no mention has been made of it whatsoever. Even though it had a whole pillar to itself in the 1997 employment guidelines, it has since disappeared from your document. It is my belief that this is one aspect of the package that it is essential to revise, as it is well known that we face far greater problems in connection with the employment of women than with that of men, and that women are substantially worse off in terms of wages and social security.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, 60 seconds for so many problems! I will have to confine myself to just a few points. As I am the rapporteur for the economic part of these integrated guidelines, I will have another opportunity to tell you all of the good points that I see in the new procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, reading these proposals from the Commission left me rather unsatisfied. Some of the proposals are so general that they are almost verging on the banal. I am well aware that the Commission’s task is a difficult one, because we live in a Europe of 25 Member States, with sometimes very different economic and social situations. In this regard, I should like to know whether the Commission intends to do what the Vice-President, Mr Verheugen, announced, that is to complement this very general programme, this ‘one size fits all’ programme with some tailor-made ones.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the same subject, I read that the Commission was reserving the right to table a communication identifying the most relevant challenges for each of the Member States. I believe that this is the right approach and I should like to have some more details about this Commission objective.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have divided up the work between us. I will answer the questions from Mrs Andersson and Mr Goebbels, Mr Špidla will answer Questions Nos 2, 3 and 5 and Mr Almunia will answer the question on the Stability Pact.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to start with a few comments in response to Mrs Andersson’s question on structural change. Needless to say, we also agree that what matters is bringing about the necessary structural changes in Europe, a task it would be futile to try to avoid. After all, the aim of the strategy as a whole is to improve the long-term competitiveness of Europe’s economy so that it can compete successfully on the global market. We will only achieve this goal if we pursue a policy that places Europe at the cutting edge of environmental, economic and technological progress in all fields, and this is the basic idea behind our strategy. Europe cannot join in the race for lower standards, lower wages and poorer quality; it must compete to offer the best products on the market. It is obvious that this will not happen without structural change.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moving on to Mr Goebbels’ question, I am sure that someone as familiar as he is with the revised Lisbon Strategy will be aware that we are at the start of a new cycle. In essence, this first integrated guidelines package has but a single purpose, namely to provide a Community framework for the drafting of national action plans. The true nature and extent of the package will only be revealed next year, when the national action plans will be on the table for us to evaluate.</p>

    <intervention id="2-238" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Špidla" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="cs">I shall endeavour to answer the question relating to early retirement. Given that the ageing of the population will result in millions of people dropping out of the workforce, it appears to me to be quite clear that the supply of workers must be increased, and that a greater proportion of the population must participate in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Something else that is quite clear, and which is a problem that all employment policies have come up against, is that early retirement has not proved to be a useful weapon in the fight against unemployment. Instead, early retirement has played a major role in the collapse of welfare systems, in particular the pensions system. This would make it extremely difficult for us to guarantee stable living conditions in retirement for future generations, even though there can be no doubt that everyone is entitled to such conditions after a life spent working.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should like to quote a few figures that make it clear how grave the situation is. The average person is only ready to start work after approximately 22 years, and is unable to work for around 5 years of his working life. He then spends between 20 and 22 years of his life in retirement. The end result of this is that 50 years of our lives are spent out of employment, which is untenable in the long run. This is a further reason why the supply of workers must be increased and it must be made easier for older people to remain in the workforce, in order to ensure the overall stability of our welfare systems.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It was also asked why the integrated package does not deal more explicitly with social policy. The answer to this question is to be found in the overall structure of our legal system, as the Commission is not competent to present a document of the kind the Member wishes. The Treaty sets out the only alternatives open to us with regard to the guidelines, which cover economic policy and, in a separate section, employment policy; this is the legal framework within which we must operate, and there are no other alternative means by which a document on social policy could be presented. Gender mainstreaming is used to address the issue of equal opportunities in all policies and all recommendations on employment policy, including those that seek to make it possible for a greater number of women to work, those that introduce the concept of a new balance between employment and family duties, and those that endeavour to reduce the gender gap in wages. In my opinion, it is quite clear that the principle of mainstreaming is rigorously implemented in these directives and guidelines, or in other words that equal opportunities feature in all EU policies. There is no question that this applies particularly, although not exclusively, to employment policy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in reply to the question from the honourable Member on the Stability and Growth Pact following reform, the document approved today, the broad economic policy guidelines, reflects the true nature of the reform, not some caricature of them.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reform agreed at the March European Council basically consists of placing more emphasis on anti-cyclic policies at good times in the cycle, of placing more emphasis on multilateral monitoring of the economic policies implemented during good economic times, on paying more attention within budgetary monitoring to the problems and challenges of mid- and long-term sustainability and, as a trade-off, with this greater attention to anti-cyclic policies and policies aimed at improving sustainability and greater flexibility in the application of the instruments in the Treaty, which are still there for the purposes of enhanced budgetary monitoring in the excessive deficit procedures.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reference values in the Treaty, however, the budgetary limits, the need to maintain budgetary discipline, the role it must play in creating the necessary conditions for the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union, for stability of prices and for creating the conditions for economic growth, are still there. Furthermore, I can tell the honourable Member that it is going to be applied rigorously, but more effectively, because the new Stability and Growth Pact is going to allow for better coordination and more compatibility amongst budgetary monitoring policies and growth policies, as well as the introduction of structural reforms, such as those included in the Lisbon Strategy, in order to improve the growth potential and the sustainability of our growth model and hence its capacity to generate employment and increase social cohesion. That is the true purpose and content of the reform of the Stability Pact. Caricatures are for those who make them. Neither the Commission nor the European Council deserve the caricatures that have been made of the Stability Pact.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to address a final comment to Mrs Van Lancker on the relative roles of the Councils. It is the responsibility of the Council to organise its discussions. But just this morning, I took part in the meeting of the Ecofin Council in Luxembourg, I saw the document which was being discussed simultaneously in the meeting of the College of Commissioners, and I discovered that the ministers of the economy and finance intend to debate all the macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects of the broad economic policy guidelines, and also – by means of the integrated package approved by the Commission – the relationship between economic policies, the situation of the labour market and employment policies. So this Commission proposal now facilitates discussion in the Ecofin Council, the Social Affairs Council and the competitiveness Council, of the specific issues, but taking a coherent global view. That is one of the most important attributes of the Commission’s proposal approved today.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Investigation into the murder of the journalist José Couso in Iraq</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 4 March 2005, the freeing of the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena led to the killing of the Italian citizen Nicola Calipar by the US army.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Under pressure from Italian public opinion, the Italian Government and the USA have decided to carry out a joint investigation to attempt to clarify this unhappy event. But the cases of the Spanish Tele 5 cameraman, José Couso, the Ukrainian Reuters cameraman Taras Prosyuk and the Al Jazira television cameraman Tarek Ayoub, who were all killed as a result of an attack carried out by US forces on the Hotel Palestine in Baghdad, have not been the subject of any investigation or court proceedings to date, as far as we know.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given that José Couso was a European citizen, what steps could be taken on the part of the European Union with a view to carrying out a joint investigation with the US authorities, so as to throw light on what happened and, where appropriate, determine who was responsible?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">On 8 April 2003 two cameramen, Spaniard José Couso working for the television station Telecinco and Ukrainian Taras Protsyuk working for Reuters news agency, were killed in Baghdad when the American army fired on the Palestine Hotel, where several hundred non-embedded journalists were staying. On the same day, 8 April 2003, Jordanian journalist Tarek Ayoub from the Al-Jazeera channel was also killed during an American air raid. According to Reporters Without Borders, the report provided by the American authorities on the circumstances surrounding these tragedies is inadequate. It does not identify those responsible, and conceals the lack of communication between the soldiers who fired on the Palestine Hotel and their superiors with regard to the fact that journalists were present inside the building.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What steps might be taken by the European Union with a view to an independent inquiry being held into the circumstances surrounding the death of José Couso, in order that the culprits are identified and tried and the victim's family receives compensation?</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioner, I believe it is important to defend the role played by journalists as a fundamental element of democracy. As well as expressing regret at what has happened, Commissioner, in accordance with the current Treaties – I am not talking about the Constitution – the Commission and the Council, and not just the Member States, are obliged to defend the rights of European citizens in third countries, including in conflict situations. And that is part of the question, because there are two problems here: one of them is the defence of freedom of information and the other, the defence of the rights of the European citizens and their families in third countries. And so far, the United States authorities have not carried out any investigation leading to prosecution or providing any compensation for the families of Mr Couso and the other people murdered in similar circumstances.</p>

Under current legislation in Spain, members of the public may bring cases to the attention of investigating magistrates independently of law enforcement and other state agencies. In that respect, therefore, Judge Guillermo Ruiz Polanco of the Audiencia Nacional has commenced preliminary investigations. He thus accepted the lawsuit filed on 27 May by Mr Couso’s mother and siblings against three members of the Third Infantry Division. I cannot say what the outcome will be, but that has been filed.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: The disenfranchisement of expatriate voters re Constitution Treaty</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Is the Commission aware that many British citizens who have chosen to retire to other EU Member States cannot currently vote in national referenda on the proposed European Constitution? Under current domestic legislation, if they left the UK more than 15 years ago they no longer have the right to vote there, yet they are not automatically granted the right to vote in their new country of residence either. Whilst it is up to individual Member States to grant such a right, should there not be some coordination between Member States so that the voices of such people can be heard? Surely it has to be fundamentally wrong that any European citizen is denied a vote on such an important issue? Does the Commission know how many European citizens are affected in such a way, and can it propose ways for Member States to work together to resolve the problem?</p>

      <p sl="en">The definition of the conditions of the right to vote in national elections and referenda belongs to the competence of the Member States. It is therefore up to each Member State to lay down the appropriate rules on the right to vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has received complaints from Union citizens – not only the honourable Member – who, as a result of exercising their right to free residence in a Member State other than their home Member State, have no right to participate in national or regional elections or referenda, either in their Member State of residence or in their home Member State. This issue has also been mentioned in the recently adopted Fourth Report from the Commission on the citizenship of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Sugar-based bioethanol</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In view of the constantly rising oil prices, and especially in view of the current reform of the sugar sector, does the Commission consider that the time has come for all those concerned – including governments, all relevant Directorates at the Commission, appropriate experts and the commercial sector – to give serious consideration to the possibility of developing a sugar-based bioethanol industry in the EU?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-257" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kroes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The July communication on sugar reform recognises the importance of various industries, and particularly the bioethanol industry as sugar users. It therefore proposes the production of sugar beyond the quota at a price closer to that on the world market, for the processing of specific products like bioethanol.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know sugar beet for the production of biofuel can already be cultivated outside the quota limits. The forthcoming legislative proposal will have to ensure that sufficient sugar is available at competitive prices for these industries, including for its increasing use in biofuel.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the biofuels directive, Member States are required to promote and to set targets for the use of biofuels. Bioethanol from sugar and grain is a good way to meet this objective. The Commission is taking steps to ensure that all Member States fulfil their obligations under the directive. The Commission will review the implementation of the directive in 2006 and will, if necessary, propose measures to reinforce it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is aware that some firms in the bioethanol industry have expressed reluctance to invest in processing facilities in the EU because they are concerned about the possibility of tariff reductions, leading to large-scale imports from low-cost sugar cane ethanol producers outside the EU. The Commission believes that a ‘win-win’ solution should be found that leads to a rapid increase in EU bioethanol production and consumption, combined in a proportionate manner with increased imports.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fuel quality directive places a limit on the ethanol content of petrol. The Commission is reviewing certain aspects of the directive and will take into account the need to encourage the use of alternative fuels, including biofuels, as well as the need to introduce modifications for other parameters in the fuel specifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission continues to support targeted research action aimed at developing cost-competitive alternative fuel technology, including ethanol production from sweet sorghum, cereals, agricultural residues and other ligno-cellulosic feedstock.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission currently contributes to the creation of a European biofuels industry by supporting and facilitating initiatives to create a biofuel technology platform. Stakeholders on this platform will include, amongst others, the agricultural and forestry sectors, bioethanol producers and the sugar industry.</p>

With that in mind, could you give me an assurance that no stone will be left unturned by your directorate-general, and the other directorates involved including research, energy, transport, etc., to ensure that all necessary research and evaluation is carried out to establish the viability of bioethanol produced from sugar beet? Furthermore, do you agree with me that in view of the frightening developments in world climate change and the constant rise in fuel prices, this research must be done sooner rather than late?</p>

      <p sl="en">I can be quite clear: there will be economic analyses to find the most efficient source for biofuels, taking into account the fact that the Commission is really aware of the importance of this. Various options for out-of-quota sugar are already being analysed. However, this question will only be answered when the Commission tables the legislative proposal for reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar. The reform proposal will have to take into account the outcome of the WTO sugar panel, which is expected to be known in late April.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission cannot, therefore, table the legislative proposal before June or July 2005. The Commission will set up a biomass action plan for the second half of 2005.

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Competition rules and State aid for the nuclear power industry</p>
      <p sl="unknown">O 22 September 2004, the Commission announced that it was approving a payment of EUR 6 billion by the Government of the United Kingdom to assist the restructuring of British Energy. On 1 December 2004 the Commission announced that it was instituting an inquiry into whether the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) contravened the Treaty. The NDA is to be made responsible for the Sellafield Mox Plant and the Magnox nuclear power plants and will release BNFL from its 'polluter pays' obligations, which can be regarded as constituting State aid.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How much money could be involved in the second of these cases, and does the Commission agree that State aid ought really to be internalised in the cost price of nuclear power rather than making the tax-payer foot the bill for it?</p>

That document includes a detailed estimate of the amount of State aid potentially involved for each of the activities that will be undertaken by the Agency.</p>

If I do not misunderstand you, you very definitely share the view that state support to nuclear power stations should actually be internalised in the total price of energy, of electricity, which, as far as I am aware, does not happen. I would like to ask you which measures you will be taking in the next few years during your mandate to ensure that we know what level of state support is given to nuclear power stations and to what extent this state support is also internalised in the cost price, thus giving the consumer a clear idea of how much nuclear energy actually costs.</p>

      <p sl="en">I can assure you that the Commission intends to apply the ‘polluter pays’ principle to the nuclear sector as well. Both the Commission’s final decision on the restructuring of British Energy and its decision to open proceedings on the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority make it clear that under the polluter pays principle, operators of nuclear stations bear the primary responsibility for the payment of the management of their waste and other nuclear liabilities, including planned decommissioning.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, one has to keep in mind that, as with all principles of Community law, the polluter pays principle must be reconciled with other Community principles and objectives, which may, in certain circumstances, conflict with it. In the British Energy case, for instance, the polluter pays principle had to be reconciled with the need to preserve nuclear safety, which is also, as you know, a major Community objective enshrined in the Euratom Treaty. In such cases the Commission seeks to strike the best possible balance between diverging principles for the benefit of the Community.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 46 by Katerina Batzeli (H-0218/05)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Mergers in the field of the audiovisual media</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mergers between undertakings are regulated both by the relevant basic articles of the Treaty and by Regulation (EC) 139/2004 , which stipulates that the review of concentration practices falls exclusively within the Commission's competence and that, consequently, the Member States may not apply their national competition laws (exclusivity principle) except in specific cases where the Commission itself considers national intervention necessary.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What approach will the Commission take to the operation of groups and mergers in the media and the definition of dominant market position in relation to the media, with the aim of fostering pluralism and objective information?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-266" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kroes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">According to the merger regulation, the Commission cannot take pluralism of the media into account as a legal criterion when it decides whether a merger with a Community dimension is compatible with the common market. In carrying out its assessment, it is entitled to take account only of competition-related or economic criteria when determining whether the transaction in question significantly impedes competition in the common market.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, notwithstanding the Commission’s sole jurisdiction to examine mergers with a Community dimension, Article 21(4) of the regulation provides that Member States may take appropriate measures to protect legitimate interests other than those taken into consideration by the regulation, provided that they are compatible with the general principles and other provisions of Community law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legitimate interests specifically recognised by the merger regulation include media plurality. ‘The Member State’s right to plead the plurality of the media recognises the legitimate concern to maintain diversified sources of information for the sake of plurality of opinion and multiplicity of use’. This would appear to include the objective information referred to in the question by the honourable Member.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear from the foregoing that the Member States should as a matter of priority take appropriate measures under their national law to safeguard the plurality of the media if that legitimate interest were to be threatened by a merger with a Community dimension.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, the Commission points out that in practice the aim of the merger regulation, namely to preserve and develop competitive market structures, can go hand in hand, at least to some extent, with safeguarding media plurality. When the Commission considers whether a merger with a Community dimension hampers competition on a media market, it necessarily examines the degree of concentration and hence indirectly the degree of pluralism on that market.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: State aid</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Irish Government recently withdrew its attempt to get State aid worth EUR 170 million sanctioned for a new microchip plant in Ireland. The Commission has said that the project did not involve sufficient innovation or jobs to justify giving assistance. It is claimed that the Commission's interpretation of the guidelines on State aid is narrow, and that this decision may hamper all Member States' attempts to compete in a global market for high-tech industry investment.

    <intervention id="2-268" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kroes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission doubted the compatibility of the investment project with the EC State Aid Control rules for two main reasons.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, there was a real risk of distortion of the conditions of competition since Intel has very significant market power in microchip production, and the aid would allow the company to reinforce its dominance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on the basis of the information submitted, the investment project appeared to be for the large-scale manufacturing of microchips. There was no indication that research and development activity would be transferred to Europe, nor of the creation of new jobs at the Leixlip site.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, Leixlip is located in a prosperous region that may not be eligible for regional aid after 2006. Any regional investment aid therefore needs to refer to a project scheduled to start before the end of 2006, which was not the case with Modules II and III of the investment project.</p>
      <p sl="en">For these reasons the Commission envisaged to launch an in-depth inquiry according to state aid rules, in order to analyse the balance of the positive and negative aspects of the aid.

On the one hand, the Commission says that it wants the European Union to become one of the most or the most competitive IT-based economy and, on the other hand, it turns down an application for aid for something that will not now be allocated anywhere else within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">I understand your reason for asking this question. It is worthwhile in itself and therefore I am quite happy that the matter has been raised, because it gives me an opportunity to explain.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not underestimate the importance of the facilities in Leixlip for the local economy. This is aid for a mobile manufacturing project, which will maintain a large number of jobs in the region for seven years, but will not create any new employment. To be quite frank, Ireland is an example that proves how important the European Union and our policy to stimulate the economy is.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in this case no new jobs would be created. There is no indication that the project would lead to a transfer of any significant part of the company’s research and development base to Europe from the US, for example, or would develop other synergies or spillover effects, which would in turn contribute to innovation in Europe, going beyond the specific manufacturing operations concerned. This is a pure manufacturing project for the large-scale production of microchips that will help Intel to maintain its position as a leader in the relevant market. It was exactly the combination of those points and arguments that led us to think what we were thinking until the Irish Government withdrew the notification.</p>

Would the Commission consider taking action against those companies that do not provide simple information on how to make a transfer between, for the same price as transfers made within, Member States as laid out in Regulation (EC) 2560/2001 ? Also, does the Commission agree that the restriction to one credit card company is in blatant disregard for the EU's competition laws? Would the Commission also consider taking action against those responsible for this debacle?</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission is examining the ticket sale arrangements for the 2006 World Cup under EU competition rules following a recent complaint filed by the UK consumer organisation ‘Which?’ against FIFA, the German Football Federation and MasterCard, but I am sure this information has also arrived on the honourable Member’s desk.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the first four sales periods, consumers who do not have a German bank account can pay for tickets by using MasterCard products or by making an international bank transfer. The issue of MasterCard exclusivity and bank transfer fees for making international bank transfers raised by the honourable Member are also part of the complaint that the Commission is currently examining with the required urgency.</p>
      <p sl="en">First all the relevant facts need to be established and examined under the relevant EU competition provisions before the Commission can take a position. If, at the end of the examination, the Commission were to conclude that there was an infringement, the Commission could take appropriate action, for instance ordering the arrangements to be stopped, and fine the company or companies that have breached EU competition law.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 on cross-border payments in euro, it establishes that cross-border transfers in euro up to the amount of EUR 12 500 until 31 December 2005 shall be at the same price as national transfers in euro. For countries outside the eurozone, this price can be very high: a transfer in euro in the UK currently costs more than EUR 20. The Commission regrets that on 14 March 2005 FIFA issued a press release which gave an incorrect interpretation of this regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner. I would be grateful to learn exactly what action you plan to take and how quickly, because clearly time is not on our side.</p>
      <p sl="en">You may recall that we had similar problems with the sales of tickets by the French football authorities during the World Cup held in France. A number of MEP colleagues, including me, took them to the European Court of Justice; the eventual result of which was that the Commission intervened and they were fined EUR 500 on the basis that they had contravened European Union regulations.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 49 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (H-0163/05)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Disposal of toxic and hazardous waste in Greece</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In Greece very little information is available about the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste, including hospital waste, despite the danger it poses for public health and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given that Greece is in breach of Directive 91/689/EEC (Article 8(3)) and that the European Court of Justice has already found against it in its judgment of 13 June 2002 (Case C-33/01), will the Commission say whether Greece has drawn up tables or criteria on the basis of which waste is accepted for each class of landfill site? If so, has this information been forwarded to the Commission and when? Does the Commission know the amount of toxic and hazardous waste produced annually in Greece and how it is disposed of: is it stored temporarily, incinerated, dumped in landfill sites or exported for final disposal in other countries (and which countries)? Has Greece complied with the above-mentioned ECJ judgment against it and, if not, does the Commission intend to initiate proceedings against Greece once again before the ECJ, pursuant to Article 228(2) of the EC Treaty, and specify a fine?</p>

    <intervention id="2-278" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dimas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Μember of the Commission . The honourable Member touches on various issues relating to the application of Community legislation on hazardous waste in Greece. I shall reply to these issues one at a time.</p>
      <p sl="el">As far as the criteria on the basis of which waste is accepted at each class of landfill site is concerned, the procedures and measures for accepting waste at sanitary landfill sites, as they are euphemistically called in Greece, are basically set out in joint ministerial decree 29407/3508 of 2002 transposing the landfill of waste directive into Greek legislation. All Greek decrees on hazardous waste management are notified to the Commission as soon as they are issued. Council decision 2003/33 establishing criteria and procedures for the acceptance of waste at landfills entered into force in June 2004. The Member States are required to apply the criteria set out in the second part of the annex to the said decision by 16 July 2005. Greece has still not notified any additional measures of compliance with this decision.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second question concerns information on the hazardous waste produced annually in Greece. Within the framework of the submission of reports on the application of the hazardous waste directive, the Greek authorities pass on information on the quantities of waste produced annually and the methods used to dispose of or recover it. According to the information available for the period from 1998 to 2003, an average of 363 400 tonnes of hazardous waste was produced annually. Most of this, approximately two thirds of the hazardous waste produced, is stored temporarily before it is definitively disposed of or recovered. More detailed information is available to the honourable Member, if he is interested.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as regards non-compliance with the judgment of 13 June 2002, Article 8, paragraph 3 of Directive 91/689 makes provision for a specific obligation to submit reports. To be precise, the Member States are required to send the Commission information on every unit or undertaking or establishment engaged in the disposal and recovery of hazardous waste. In its judgment of 13 June 2002, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Hellenic Republic had failed to fulfil its obligations under the above provisions. As the Commission was sent unsatisfactory information on the measures which Greece had taken to comply with the Court judgment, the Commission set in motion the procedure in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty of the European Communities. In response to the official letter of notification from the Commission, the Greek authorities sent the information available, as required under Article 8. This information is being examined in order to establish the extent to which Greece has complied with the aforementioned Court judgment. If the information passed on is found to be unsatisfactory, the Commission shall be forced to issue a reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 228, paragraph 2 of the Treaty of the European Communities.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply, but I must insist. Exactly one year ago, the Commission spoke in its reply to the European Parliament of 230 000 tonnes of hazardous and uncontrolled waste in Greece. Given that the competent department of environmental inspectors speaks in its report of a complete absence of the relevant controls, I ask you specifically:</p>
      <p sl="el">First, has the Commission recorded specific steps by the Greek authorities over the past year?</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, what legal action do you intend to take to make the authorities in our common homeland comply at long last with Community legislation.</p>

      <p sl="el">As far as the quantity is concerned, I spoke to you of even more. In 1998, the quantity was 379 000 tonnes of waste, in 1999 it was 376 000, in 2000 it was 391 000 and it stayed more or less at these levels up to 2003. We have information up to then. We have none after 2003. Of this quantity, approximately 60%, although this percentage had risen to about 80% in 2003, is still in storage on temporary sites. Of course, under the Community directive, if the waste is kept in temporary storage for longer than a year, then the site must be classed as a landfill and must comply with the relevant preconditions, which is not happening in the case of the Greek authorities, which is why, as I said, the relevant procedures have been set in motion.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Compliance with the Nitrates Directive</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC has been in existence over 10 years but has been a difficult directive to implement for Member States.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission outline how the Nitrates Directive is being implemented in Member States, the level of compliance with it and difficulties found with implementing it? More specifically, can the Commission give its view on Ireland's most recent action plan, which aims to fulfil its obligations relating to this Directive?</p>

    <intervention id="2-282" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dimas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission adopted the second report on the implementation of the Nitrates Directive in 2002. It indicated that at that stage significant progress had been made by Member States in this area. In recent years that progress has been maintained. All Member States have by now established water monitoring networks. All have either designated nitrate-vulnerable zones and established action programmes for those zones, or made use of the possibility given by the directive to establish an action programme for the whole territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ireland is among a group of Member States that took this option. Nitrate-vulnerable zones, including whole territories, accounted for about 38% of the total European Union of 15 in 2000. Since then the percentage has increased because of the designation of new vulnerable zones in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Greece, Spain and Italy and because of the territorial approach chosen by Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States are also upgrading and further developing their action programmes as they realise that, in order to improve water quality, strong and fully applicable action programmes are necessary. Similar progress has been taking place in the new Member States. They have fulfilled the commitment set out in the Accession Treaty and by the date of accession had designated nitrate-vulnerable zones, established action programmes and adopted codes of good agricultural practice. The Commission is currently examining the quality of these designations and action programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite that progress, it may take years before we see a considerable improvement in water quality. There is a time lag between action and results. However, the trend seems positive as encouraging signs are already emerging in some countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is fully committed to ensuring that the Nitrates Directive is correctly implemented in Member States by using all the tools at its disposal. That clearly includes the launch of infringement proceedings against Member States that do not correctly implement the different steps required by the directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">An infringement procedure is currently open against Ireland. Following the ruling of the European Court of Justice of 11 March 2003, the Irish authorities officially submitted to the Commission the action programme established according to Article 5 of the directive. The Commission considers the Irish action programme not fully compliant with the directive on several issues, which were indicated in detail in the letter of formal notice sent to Ireland at the end of 2004. A reply is still awaited.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to ask you, Commissioner, to clarify something for me. In relation to the issue of positive trends in water quality, you said that it would take some years to see considerable improvement. There are concerns that if you do not see considerable improvement, as you say, stricter rules will be enforced in relation to agriculture. Could you please comment on that?</p>

      <p sl="en">You should know that the Commission considers the issue of nitrates to be very important for certain countries. About 20% of Europe’s groundwater has an excessive nitrate concentration and the same problem affects at least 30-40% of rivers and lakes. In many countries we have an influx of nitrogen to coastal waters which, in certain areas, could be very important for the coastal waters and seas. Agriculture is responsible for about 50-80% of the nitrogen input to water in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ireland was in compliance with neither the submission of the action plan, nor the designation of the vulnerable areas, and it did not specify which waters were polluted. It complied with the designation of the whole of the territory as a vulnerable area, but the action plan it sent is not satisfactory and as a result we have taken Ireland to court. Ireland sent an answer on 22 December and we replied, also on 22 December, giving the Irish authorities three months to respond. Ireland asked for a one-month extension, and the deadline ends on 22 April. We are therefore waiting to see its answers to particular issues we raised.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning farmers, there is a big problem and there are questions of whether a derogation would be requested for certain areas. In order to have a derogation there has to be an action plan that is acceptable to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Until the resolution of its final status, the Commission is making all efforts to keep Kosovo firmly anchored in the Stabilisation and Association process under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. The Commission believes it is important that Kosovo participate fully in this process on the basis of its own merits. It would indeed be detrimental for the security of Europe if Kosovo becomes a black hole in a region which is otherwise progressing towards European Union pre-accession and later accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission supports the provisional institutions of self-government in making progress in the implementation of the priority standards related to the rule of law and multiethnicity before the review date of mid-2005. The Commission has included the standards as the main priorities in the European Partnership for Kosovo. We provide over EUR 125 million in CARDS assistance programmes. We continue to support Kosovo through the SAP Tracking mechanism by giving policy advice and assistance to counterbalance the perception that once the status talks start, standards will no longer be necessary. They will be even more important once the status talks start.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is committed to promoting the EU perspective of Kosovo, since, regardless of its future status, Kosovo is and will remain in Europe. In this context, we have set up a liaison office in Pristina that works together with the representative of the High Representative, as well as the European Agency for Reconstruction and the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the Commission is preparing a communication to the Council on enhancing the European perspective of Kosovo.

Personally, I do not foresee that the EU will govern Kosovo as the successor to UNMIK, as this would contradict our policy of building capacity and sustainability in partner countries with whom we hope one day to negotiate. The scope of EU involvement in the future needs to be examined very carefully in view of its important political and financial implications.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very helpful and detailed answer. There are two specific points I should like to address, the first being that the task of achieving standards obviously becomes more difficult when unemployment stands at 70%. It may well be necessary to determine a status – at least on a medium-term basis – before standards can be met, and some indication of this status, if nothing else, must be given before the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="en">I share the concern of the honourable Member about the high level of unemployment in Kosovo. It is detrimental that the province has developed unemployment that, on the basis of some statistics, is about 50%, but on the basis of other statistics is even higher. Therefore, it is indispensable that we continue to support Kosovo with our financial assistance. It is also vital that the provisional institutions of self-government in Kosovo be given support under UNMIK Pillar 4, which the EU supports, in order to make headway as regards economic reform, including privatisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In general, the settlement is needed sooner rather than later as the demographic pressure in Kosovo makes its economic recovery a very difficult task in the absence of a clear legally defined and internationally recognised framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the future role of the Union, the idea that the European Union would replace the United Nations in a leading executive role would be problematic. We support the idea of a streamlined UN mission handing over as much responsibility as possible to empower the local authorities that should, as much as possible, be our direct interlocutors in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">The accession negotiations on Chapter 24 were closed on the basis of a considerable number of commitments being undertaken by the Bulgarian Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">The continued reform of the judicial system stands out as the overarching priority for Bulgaria in its preparations for accession. Clear steps for the reform of the judiciary have been agreed in the accession negotiations. The commitments undertaken must be fully respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Important challenges lie ahead, notably as regards the adoption of the new penal procedure code, making the entire pre-trial investigation phase simpler and corresponding to EU best practices. This requires a clear consensus of all parties involved, including the political parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the overall working conditions, the need for enhancing specialisation of judges and prosecutors, the appointment procedures, access to legal aid in practice, and other commitments from the accession negotiations will need to be addressed. Apart from political will, sufficient budgetary resources are also needed to meet these criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the Bulgarian authorities should now make every effort to ensure the completion of the reform, especially with regard to the pre-trial phase. This is indispensable to ensure that Bulgaria has the legal means and resources to fully apply the rule of law and requirements of membership.</p>
      <p sl="en">It seems as though the preparation for this reform is taking more time than was initially expected. The Bulgarian authorities have nevertheless reiterated their commitment to a new draft penal procedures code to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on 15 May. I am reasonably confident that this commitment will be respected, as this is indispensable for Bulgaria to meet its commitments from the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will keep a close watch on this area through intensified monitoring, to get sufficient assurances that progress continues after the closure of negotiations and that the country will be effectively ready for membership in 2007.</p>

      <p sl="el">We know that, until now, there has been a series of programmes financed by the European Commission within the framework of what we call twinning programmes with candidate countries.

      <p sl="en">As you quite rightly said, we are currently financing twinning programmes with Bulgaria and Romania. In my view these have been one of the most efficient tools of technology transfer in institution-building and reinforcing administrative capacity. It is our intention to continue these programmes with Bulgaria and Romania, as well as when we start negotiations with Turkey, and once we make further progress with the countries in the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, twinning provides one of the best tools for providing know-how and transferring institutional knowledge to the candidate countries and potential candidate countries.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 61 by Anna Hedh (H-0210/05)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Turkish women's right to work</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Now that Turkey has been given the go-ahead for future negotiations on EU accession, the latest figure for women's rate of employment in the country is a cause for concern. Only 10% of Turkish women are in gainful employment. Social democrats have long regarded the question of women's right to work as extremely important for increasing equality between women and men. Women in gainful employment have a sound basis for an independent life and do not become financially dependent on the family to support them. This issue has also been highlighted in the Lisbon strategy where the objective is to increase women's employment in the EU to 60% by 2010. In the light of the Copenhagen criterion requiring all applicant countries to be able to meet the Union's political, economic and monetary objectives, will the Commission say whether the question of women's employment will be raised as a priority matter in future accession negotiations with Turkey?</p>

      <p sl="en">In its regular reports and bilateral contacts with the Turkish authorities, the Commission has consistently highlighted the low rate of participation of women in the official labour market as a serious problem inhibiting the economic emancipation of women, and as a constraint on the economic potential of Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, gender equality, and particularly equal treatment in employment between persons irrespective of gender, is part of the Community acquis in the area of employment and social policy. Therefore, the Commission closely monitors Turkey’s alignment with the requirements of EU legislation and its practical implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, despite the determination shown by the government and a number of positive measures, limited progress has been made on the adoption of legislation aimed at guaranteeing the effective prohibition of discrimination in employment. During negotiations on the relevant chapters of the Community acquis , this matter will be followed very closely and considered a priority issue.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for that extremely interesting and thorough answer.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The situation of women in Turkey is important, and I should like to address another issue in connection with the membership negotiations. A large demonstration by women was, of course, held in Turkey in the run-up to International Women's Day on 8 March. It was brutally suppressed by the police. The police concerned were suspended immediately, and Turkey’s ambassador in Brussels has been to the European Parliament to talk about the matter and explain what Turkey is doing. Because such police brutality is incompatible with the demands we are making of a country that is to conduct membership negotiations with the EU, I wonder if Commissioner Rehn knows if Turkey has taken further judicial measures following the incident concerned.</p>

      <p sl="en">That was one of the key issues when the EU-Turkey ministerial troika met in Ankara on 7 March. By coincidence, we held our troika meeting the day after the demonstration to which you referred. Once we saw what had happened and had obtained information, we issued a clear statement on behalf of the European Union, together with the Luxembourg presidency and the forthcoming UK presidency, in which we condemned all violence in demonstrations. We also condemned the disproportionate use of force, which was clearly being used in the treatment of the mainly female and young demonstrators in Istanbul.</p>
      <p sl="en">Foreign Minister Gul said in our troika meeting that he regretted the events and that the government will conduct an investigation into what happened, how and why.</p>
      <p sl="en">Three investigations are currently being carried out in Turkey: one by the police, one by the Ministry of the Interior and the third one by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. We are closely following them. Once the investigations are complete, we will have them at our disposal.

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 62 by Panagiotis Beglitis (H-0213/05)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Construction and operation of three nuclear power stations in Turkey</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A recent article in the Turkish newspaper 'Radikal' reported on Turkey's energy programme and the Turkish Government's intention to proceed with the construction and operation by 2012 of three nuclear power stations, the first of which is to be built in the region of Konia. If these reports are confirmed, this will give rise to a new situation in the wider Mediterranean region and be a source of legitimate concern to neighbouring countries and peoples, especially Greece and its island regions, which are close to the areas selected as sites for the power stations. Bearing in mind Turkey's vulnerability to earthquakes, the building of power stations represents a nightmare scenario both for the environment and for the lives of millions of people in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Has the Commission become aware of this information through its regular contacts with the Turkish authorities? If so, what steps has it taken, or will it take, to prevent this programme from going ahead? More generally, how will it approach the question of nuclear power in Turkey during the pre-accession negotiations beginning in October 2005?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-305" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I would very much like to respond to the question of Cyprus, but I can do that next time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is aware that the option to use nuclear energy has been under consideration in Turkey for many years, since 1965. We have informed Parliament on this issue on several occasions. At this point, Turkey does not operate any nuclear power plant, nor has a licence been issued for the construction of any such plant.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission recalls that under the Treaties, each Member State is free to use the energy sources of its choice. Currently, roughly half of all Member States use nuclear energy. Consequently, the decision to use or not to use nuclear power has never been the subject of any accession negotiations. However, as you may recall, in the previous enlargement round, the EU insisted on the need for a high level of nuclear safety in candidate countries operating nuclear plants, and substantial parts of the pre-accession strategy have been devoted to this aim. In certain cases, the EU has even demanded the early closure of old nuclear plants or nuclear reactors which had been identified by the international community as non-upgradeable at reasonable cost.</p>
      <p sl="en">If Turkey is going to generate nuclear energy, it will obviously have to ensure a high level of nuclear safety as well. As a candidate country, Turkey will also be expected to comply with the Euratom acquis on nuclear safeguards and radiation protection, as well as the Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments. This includes transboundary consultation with Member States. Under the International Convention of Nuclear Safety, of which the European Atomic Energy Community is a contracting party, Turkey already has an obligation to consult neighbouring countries on proposed nuclear installations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several potential sites have been named in the past in Turkey, while only one site has received a licence. Studies for up to three other possible sites have recently been included in the investment plans of the Ministry of Energy. The Commission has followed with interest the situation as it has evolved, and in particular the evaluation of relevant seismic conditions. It is clear that any nuclear power plant would have to be designed and built in a manner allowing it to withstand any potential seismic event and thus guarantee the necessary level of safety under all conditions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I should specifically like to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply. That is precisely why I asked this question; it was in order to ask the Commission to keep a close eye on this crucial issue, which is a crucial issue for the environment in the region, which is giving rise to specific concerns in neighbouring countries and in Greece. I would like the Commissioner to monitor this issue closely during negotiations. I do not dispute the right of a country to build nuclear power stations. The point is, first, the high level of security needed and, secondly, the fact that all of us – including the European Commission – need to guarantee that nuclear energy will be used solely for peaceful purposes and not for military purposes.</p>

You are right that we cannot, on the basis of our own Treaty, question a potential Member State’s right to have recourse to nuclear energy if it plans and builds a nuclear energy plant on the basis of all the rules and regulations and respects nuclear security. But in any case nuclear security will be a core issue, especially if there is a reason to focus on that issue. Turkey is not yet at the construction stage. It is at the planning stage.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I cannot say that I am happy to be here discussing this issue with you because it is not a pleasant one, but at the same time I think it is useful that we have the opportunity to exchange views and present to you what we in the Commission are planning for the future and what actions we are taking.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that the influenza pandemic is a threat and, as the scientists advise, it is no longer a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’. It is overdue, it is something that happens every so many years, it should have happened already. How we deal with this is therefore a top priority, both at Community level, coordinating the Member States, but also working together with WHO, not only in Europe, but also worldwide, and with some of our partners such as the United States, which shares our concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have undertaken work in many fields. Some of it concerns, for example, measures directed at the source of human infection. We are discussing the plans of the Member States and how we can coordinate them at EU level. We are looking at vaccines and antiviral drugs and at surveillance and diagnostics in inter-connected laboratories to identify a pandemic strain. We need, of course, to identify the potential sources of this problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, one of these potential sources is avian flu, which is a real problem. It already exists in Asia and many people have already died from it. But the main concern is that this disease has become endemic. It is not an epidemic that will simply go away; it is there, it is rooted and its eradication cannot be considered a short-term objective. We have also taken measures to try to deal with this problem. The Commission has adopted a new directive on measures for the control of avian influenza to ensure that the Member States can apply the most appropriate surveillance and control measures. In this way we hope we can reduce the risk when major outbreaks occur in the Community in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a plan at Community level, but we also need to have national plans at Member State level. In March, together with the World Health Organization, we organised a workshop where we could discuss and exchange views on these plans. It was a useful exercise. We helped Member States to update and improve their national preparedness plans. At the same time we identified those Member States that do not yet have plans and we will help them develop such plans. This is very important because we have a plan at Community level but the actual implementation of plans is up to the Member States. We are happy to say that the response by the Member States showed that the public health services are taking this problem very seriously. We are considering how best to implement the Community plan. Its aspects include communication, isolation and vaccination, the use of drugs, restrictions on public gatherings, and information to the public.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are planning a Europe-wide exercise, a kind of military-style exercise, that will put these plans to the test and, we hope, see how they work on a fake scenario. We intend to conduct this exercise before the next influenza season in order to test the plans and see what is lacking, what the problems are, so that we can correct the plans and coordinate them better.</p>
      <p sl="en">A very important problem, as I am sure you are aware, is the issue of vaccines. With vaccines we have three problems. The first is the issue of actually identifying the strain, because in the case of a pandemic we expect a new strain. Then there is the issue of developing the vaccine and, just as important, of having the capacity to produce enough vaccines to cover the population in the event of a pandemic. Because the strain will be a new one, stockpiling vaccines is no solution and does not help.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have met with representatives of the Member States and we have agreed a way of engaging the industry in a kind of public-private partnership to facilitate the rapid production of pandemic vaccines in time of need. I am optimistic that we will reach an agreement with the industry. The basic principle is that the Member States will increase their level of purchase of vaccines at this stage, so as to justify enough investment to increase the capacity of the Member States in the event of a pandemic. At the same time the Member States have pledged to redouble their efforts to stick to their vaccine recommendations, so as to achieve high uptake rates among the relevant population groups, i.e. the high-risk groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, for our part, are ready to work on the drawing-up of proposals for EU recommendations that can be issued by the Council on who is to be vaccinated on public health grounds. Another possible way to increase capacity – and the industry has promised to look into this – is by converting other facilities, such as those used for veterinary medicine production, for the rapid production of vaccines in a pandemic situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, the Member States, the vaccine industry and the European Medicines Agency will work together to create a favourable situation for such production, but also for a more rapid licensing procedure. Of course all these moves may not completely resolve the problem of supply of vaccines for the Member States, but they certainly make huge strides in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">A similar process has been started with the manufacturers of antivirals. It will bring the Member States and the industry together to seek a common position. I will report back to you on this as soon as we have the outline of a solution to the problem of shortages of production and stockpiling. But we encourage Member States to proceed with stockpiling and many of them, mostly the larger Member States, are already doing so. We feel that it is a process that all Member States have to engage in, because despite all the drawbacks and all the problems that may exist in regard to the effectiveness of the antivirals, it will be the first line of defence. It will be our first means of dealing with the virus, with the disease, in the event of a pandemic. We will need to have this breathing space until we manage to develop the new vaccine and increase the capacity to actually produce it, disseminate it and use it. Since antivirals will be the first line of defence, they are worth the investment, worth the effort.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me draw your attention to a positive development, to the decisions we took last week at the Commission, in relation to the financial perspectives. We also adopted the regulation on the solidarity fund, which will include a line relating to public health threats. The decisions fall within the context of the legislative instruments and will cover the next financial perspectives. They concern the general availability of funds for health preparedness and vaccines in case of major public health threats.</p>
      <p sl="en">The solidarity fund will have a ceiling, a volume of about EUR 1 billion a year. We believe that it will have enough flexibility to cope with health emergencies, while it will also be able to help those Member States that meet the requirements to fund the effort of acquiring and using the vaccines in case of pandemic. I hope very much, indeed I am certain, that the European Parliament and the Council will make every effort towards a speedy agreement of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, another very important issue is early detection. As I said, it takes time to identify a new strain of virus and develop vaccines to deal with it. The sooner we manage to detect it, the easier it will be to deal with the problem and even to contain it as far as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">To this end we have set up a network of communication with the Member States and with the World Health Organization. However, our main instrument in this effort is the early warning and response system. Under this system Member States will inform each other and the community in case of a problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also mention the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which is becoming operational now. Of course, it will take another year or so until it can function at full capacity. When the time comes, that centre will take over and operate the early warning and response system and manage health threats of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are concerned about the influenza pandemic. We expect it to be unprecedented if it occurs and unless we take the necessary measures. Even in an optimistic scenario, the figures given to us by scientists are very worrying, with deaths worldwide in the range of about 8 million at least. But the worst-case scenarios suggest deaths in the range of 30 million. Therefore this is now one of our top priorities; it is a major concern, and we will continue working on it and making great endeavours to put all the mechanisms and structures in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, our success will depend heavily on strong political commitment and support on the part of the Council, Member States, the Commission and of course the European Parliament. I am confident that I can count on your support.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as the Commissioner has said, some countries have no plans and many countries have inadequate plans. It is therefore right that he has come here this evening to discuss this issue with us, and we welcome what he said and the plans he is making. We will certainly give him all the support we can.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last year Europe and the world were lucky. SARS and avian flu did not develop into pandemics. In the last century we were not so lucky. In 1918, in 1957, and in 1968, with Asian flu, Spanish flu, and with Hong Kong flu, we were less lucky. A million died in each of the latter two and 50 million died in 1918, a quarter of a million in my country, the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now Dr Omi of the World Health Organisation has warned that another pandemic is imminent. For months we have been calling for urgent action in Parliament to prepare for this, and yet, certainly amongst Member States, we have not seen the sense of urgency that we have looked for. For some six months or more, the United States has been stockpiling antiviral drugs and it has placed orders for four million vaccines. Italy and France have both ordered two million vaccines. Canada, Australia and Japan have all been stockpiling. As Dr Omi rightly says, although we cannot know the strain, even the existing vaccines and drugs will mitigate and protect the vulnerable, particularly children and the elderly, and key workers.</p>
      <p sl="de">But what about the other countries? The United Kingdom is not buying any vaccines. It has announced that is not its policy. It is only planning to protect 20% of our population with antivirals. And yet London, a global hub for travel, for migration, and for disease, has inadequate plans for protection through drugs and quarantine. My fears are twofold: that the pandemic will strike first from Asia to Africa or to low-income countries ill-equipped to respond; then move rapidly on into Europe, and that panic in countries that are ill-prepared could lead to international crime and violence within the European Union, including in cities such as London where 80% of people are expected to be unprotected.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have worked hard in Parliament, along with the Commission and Council, and passed in a single reading my report establishing the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. We have approved an excellent choice of director in Zsuzsanna Jakab. We now need to be assured that the first great challenge to this collaborative centre will be met in terms of rapid alert as Dr Omi says, antiviral and vaccine planning and placement, port and airport precautions and quarantine facilities. We need to work closely with the WHO, with the authorities in China, Vietnam and other affected countries in Asia, with international NGOs, with the pharmaceutical industry and with vulnerable countries in the ACP and elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">I shall be attending the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly next week. I want to take with me a message of help and support, but also assurance that Europe has taken note, is acting and will help the world protect itself from this pandemic.</p>

      <p sl="en">Group . – Madam President, I am glad that the Commissioner is here tonight and I am glad that this issue has now been given some sense of urgency. As you said, nobody is talking about ‘if’. It is only a question of ‘when’ there will be a pandemic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Citizens will not expect the European Union to micro-manage a pandemic, but they will expect it to add value. They know that diseases travel and they will expect the European Union quickly to put into place measures concerning people travelling and the movement of animals. We would like to hear that those measures are in place so that such arrangements could be made quickly. I would be interested to hear feedback on your planning for a real exercise. It would be useful for us to know how it goes.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of vaccines, I am pleased with what you said. We need a coordinated approach to vaccines. If we can get the pharmaceutical companies to work with Member States and the Commission we are more likely to get a quicker reaction if the pandemic breaks out. We need a prototype.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that we cannot stockpile the vaccine, but I understand that it is possible to develop prototype vaccines in advance, which can then be very quickly adapted for the strain when it emerges.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Bowis is right that we have a primary responsibility to our citizens to get these things right. What worries me is the impact that this will have on the poorest people on our planet. In 1918 one of the reasons why so many millions died was because so many lived in dire poverty, both in the area that is now the European Union and across the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you did not mention anything about inter-service consultations with the Development Commissioner. Is there anything that is being done in the Commission to look at aid policies for the developing countries and to make sure that the EU sees some solidarity with those countries, as well as planning for what would happen within the European Union?</p>

      <p sl="nl">It might be said that we are talking to the wrong person today. Commissioner, you are asking us for our support, and we do, of course, give it to you without reserve, because I think that you deal with the issue very well within the limits imposed on you by the framework of the Treaties, by which – whether we like it or not – we are bound. It is actually with the Council that we should be discussing this subject. It has been commented before that one does not get the feeling that the Council is aware of an enormous threat against which something must be done. Despite the discussions, coordination attempts and study groups here and there, one does not get the impression that something is actually being done.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Is that such a bad thing? Yes, of course this is, in today’s society, and certainly in the European Union, a very serious thing, for if something goes wrong in one Member State, it has repercussions for the others. It follows that it is in our interest that everything should go well across the EU. In the case of an outbreak of an animal disease, the Commissioner for Agriculture can take far-reaching decisions straight away. Immediately, streets are blocked off, whole areas sealed off and a great deal is done. If something similar were to happen among people, we would not be able to do anything. I think that you, Commissioner, should be able to take contingency measures within 24 hours as regards issues such as quarantine, disinfection measures at airports and flights from certain regions, but also where travel restrictions are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Needless to say, it would be far preferable if all Member States, in an upsurge of solidarity and unanimity, were to take such measures collectively and simultaneously, but frankly I do not hold out any hopes of this happening. I therefore believe that the Public Health Ministers should be granting you those powers. You were right in saying that, according to the WHO, it is not a question of ‘if’ the pandemic were to break out, but of ‘when’ it will. Their estimate was 8 million casualties, but that could also be 30 million. Children and people over 50 would, of course, be at high risk, and we do not have enough vaccines and antiviral medicines. Here, too, European intervention is crucial. Where should this take place? Maybe this should be undertaken in one of the EU’s neighbouring countries rather than in the EU itself.

If travel were to be restricted, what would become of the meetings of the Council and of this House?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, an outbreak does not become an epidemic in a healthy society. If we are truly in danger of an epidemic, even a pandemic, in the developed world, then we should look very carefully at ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have the wealthiest societies in the history of the world. With this, we should have the healthiest societies. Do we? No. Ever-increasing rates of chronic illness such as asthma and diabetes indicate that we are not the healthiest society. Junk food, chemicals, pollution and addictions are doing our immune systems no favours.</p>
      <p sl="de">If these are leaving us vulnerable to an epidemic, we should do something about it. We should have our health and use our wealth to prevent an epidemic in poor countries by improving water, sanitation and nutrition: the reasons for which epidemics spread. We should be anticipating a flu outbreak in the West. We are inexcusably expecting an epidemic.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We have already heard from the Commission representative, and that was very well put, that this is not a matter of whether but of when. It should be noted, however, that two principal prerequisites of a pandemic are already there. Namely, the virus is spreading among animals where it is mutating in a way that enables the virus to infect humans and jeopardise their lives. The next, third and last, step would be for the virus to start spreading among humans. We know now how avian flu was identified. Following additional potential mutations, the implicated strain, H5N1, was also used as the basis for developing a vaccine. This has only served to reconfirm something I have several times cautioned against here at the European Parliament. It is inappropriate that healthcare systems are subject to the subsidiarity principle and to national governments. Disease knows no borders, and it is the impending threat of a pandemic that has genuinely put the issue in the spotlight. It is commendable that the WHO stands ready, but I have doubts as to whether national governments are prepared to deal with this issue.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I am one of several Members here to have been seriously concerned, for months, about the risk of a flu pandemic and to have been sounding the alarm bell, because both the pharmaceutical industry and The Vaccine Fund are particularly worried. At present we do not have the necessary means to address such a risk, because we are not able to anticipate it. In fact, we know that the question is not whether an epidemic will break out one day, but when it will do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have given us a number of explanations and when you tell us that it takes six months to develop a vaccine, I wonder whether the pharmaceutical laboratories really are devoting all the necessary resources to, on the one hand, preparing antiviral drugs and, on the other, trying, once we have an isolated stem cell, to develop the appropriate vaccines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union should provide financial support, both to help to develop vaccines and carry out studies on them and to encourage mass production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A condition for receiving this funding would be for the laboratories to speed up their work on vaccines. The idea of using the solidarity fund also seems excellent, because it should also make it possible to ensure that vaccines are made available fairly and to involve the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Have we, in close cooperation with the Member States, already drawn up an appropriate emergency plan in case of an epidemic? Has the Commission carried out simulations to coordinate action with the Member States, so as, on the one hand, to avoid widespread panic and to combat the trafficking that will inevitably ensue if there really is a serious risk, and, on the other, to determine the priority areas to isolate, that is to say the places where quarantine measures should be applied, to draw up lists of the groups of people to be vaccinated as a priority and to ensure that products are distributed fairly and to everyone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like us to reflect on a framework guaranteeing the rapid and unhindered export of products from the producer countries to the non-producer countries. We expect immediate answers, because this is about preventing a disaster not only for public health but also for the economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have all been talking about ‘when’ and ‘if’. I am going to use a different word. Pandemics are not the exception, they have become almost the rule. But they do not obey any rules in themselves. They are difficult to identify before they break out and we are therefore up against an unseen problem. You have called it a problem, Commissioner, but it is more than that.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to use all our resources. We have to use our resources for production and our resources for research, and I would appreciate if the Commissioner could perhaps tell us more about this particular issue. The international scientific community has a role to play; and it is important to have reliable networking so that all the stakeholders can cooperate when the pandemic breaks out, because, as everybody knows, although we may try and have military exercises as an example of what may happen, it is extremely difficult to anticipate when it will break out.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It has already been pointed out that the flu is a disease with grave health, social and economic implications; it also has ramifications in the defence sector and politics. The greatest danger, however, is posed by various flu pandemics that may break out when a new flu virus subtype emerges that is transferable from one human to another. A flu virus of type A that causes flu not only in humans but also in animals, especially birds, pigs and horses, is the only one capable of giving rise to new virus subtypes. A new human flu virus subtype emerges as a result of recombination in an animal carrier between human and animal strains of flu virus type A. This gives rise to what is known as ‘antigen shift’. As humans are not immune to the new subtype, the disease spreads swiftly, leading to an epidemic, evolving in a matter of several months into a pandemic. Recently the WHO has indicated that we are now closer to a flu pandemic than ever before. The WHO has also urged governments to set up national boards that would deal with a potential flu pandemic and adopt national action plans. To the extent possible, my country, the Slovak Republic, has heeded this call. Vaccines constitute a sensible preventive measure, but they have their limits. As the Commissioner has pointed out, it is necessary to identify the virus, develop a vaccine, produce and market the vaccine, as well as carry out an extensive vaccination campaign. A vaccine is not effective when the disease is at an advanced stage, as it depends on the body to form necessary antibodies. Therefore, one cannot count on a vaccine in dealing with the first wave of a pandemic. At the same time, a vaccine has a short shelf life. Antiviral drugs, by contrast, appear to be an appropriate complement to vaccination since, in addition to prevention, they are also efficacious in treating advanced forms of the disease and seem essential as part of a therapeutic response to a pandemic. As they have a longer shelf life – up to five years – antiviral drugs could be stockpiled in advance. The statement by Commissioner Kyprianou gives me hope that developments will be monitored closely, and that in the best case, no emergency action will be needed.</p>

    <intervention id="2-322" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kyprianou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think we all see eye to eye on this and that is very encouraging. However, Member States have now come to realise the problem. When I went to my first Health Council as a Commissioner and I presented this problem, not all shared the concerns or the sense of urgency that existed at that moment. Sometimes that is one of the realities of life: however much we rang the alarm bell, it was not taken seriously, but when WHO rang it, it was. However, what counts is the fact that the message got through. In the ensuing meetings with ministers they showed that they had already taken steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tomorrow I will be going to Paris, where the French Government is organising a conference on three major problems: Aids, cancer and influenza. We now have the commitment on the part of the Member States. It is true that we do not yet have the legal competence, but we will get it, to a certain extent, with the Constitution, because that will give the Commission, the Community and Parliament the authority to act when there is a cross-border threat to health. Therefore, we will be able to take some of the measures that Mr Maaten said I, not Mrs Fischer Boel, can take in the case of animal health. We can currently take emergency measures, but not for humans. The Constitution will at least allow us to do this.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is right that even though we do not have the legal competence at the moment, we cannot underestimate the fact that these diseases know no borders and that there is therefore a need for coordinated action by all Member States, plus those outside the European Union. The Commission can offer this coordination and representation when we talk with countries outside the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to say two things on the issue of poor countries. Firstly, there was the Vietnam Conference on avian flu. The WHO, the FAO, the World Organisation for Animal Health and the European Union will deal with avian flu. For the time being it is an animal health problem but we all know that it is a major possible pandemic. We will take measures and find ways to help the countries involved. Toward the end of the year I plan to visit the area to see how we can work with those governments. My colleague, Mr Michel, is preparing a communication on this issue. It will not be the one we approved today but a new one that will also cover the issue of health threats. This is a brief reference today but there will be more coming soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Research on vaccines is going well. The private sector can handle the matter from that point of view. The question is about building capacity. It is an investment that has to be made by the Member States and it will be a kind of private and public partnership. It is an investment that will also be of benefit to today’s population because investments are being made to purchase more vaccines to treat the groups at risk now. That will benefit the population and will at the same time be an investment in building future capacity for manufacturing sufficient quantities of vaccines.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that this is one of my main concerns. It is an issue I keep raising in all international fora, but mostly now within the Council. It is an issue taken up by the health ministers. Perhaps the next time it will the finance ministers who will have to pay for this investment. I am optimistic, however, that under the circumstances we are on the right track. We have not solved the problem, but we have started the procedure. We are getting there, but we still have a long way to go. Time is running out. That is why all the efforts are concentrated. We will take every step possible before the next influenza season next winter.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-326" speaker_id="4436" name="Gianni PITTELLA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Italy" birth_date="19-11-1958" birth_place="Lauria " p_group="Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament" m_state="IT">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, Council representative, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that the 2006 budget has numerous peculiarities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Above all, it is a bridging budget; while we approve the general principles – at least I hope we do – the debate on the financial perspectives is approaching its final hurdle.</p>
      <p sl="it">We shall have to take a decision on how much, what and how – in other words to decide whether to resign ourselves to a pared-down, impotent Europe or to fight together so that financial rigour can be combined with adequate resources for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">The key exists, but we have to know how to use it with courage. The key is the quality of spending, which must be focused on high-value-added sectors and common policies with a European logic and significance.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a challenge which – on an annual perspective – we, too, face with the 2005 budget. The principles unanimously approved in the Committee on Budgets – and I take this opportunity of thanking all colleagues and political groups for their constructive input – point in that direction: rigour, transparency, a further step towards simplification and a concentration on priorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our proposals – as I must reiterate to the Commissioner – are consistent with the Commission’s annual strategic plan. We shall obviously see whether, during the course of the procedure, we can continue to remain in step – that, in any event, is our hope – and we shall see if the cautious openness shown by the Council will give rise to any firm decisions.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are some points on which, quite frankly, I cannot see how or why we should differ. The first is the increased emphasis on rural development as compared to direct support for agriculture; the second is an adequate level of payments under the Structural Funds heading. After so many years of legitimate complaints, expenditure on Structural Funds by states and regions has accelerated sharply. That was what everyone was hoping to see, and is why it would now be illogical to refrain from guaranteeing adequate resources via supplementary budgets, as has already occurred during the year.</p>
      <p sl="it">The third point is the reinforcement of support for research, innovation, competitiveness and the internationalisation of companies; the fourth is the promotion of measures for information and the knowledge society; the fifth is the implementation of Europe-wide cultural activities and social policies and the continuation of infrastructure programmes developing the great physical infrastructure of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final point – which for me constitutes the first on a political level – is lifelong training, education and youth exchange programmes. Young people must be the prime beneficiaries of our measures because without them there is no Europe and no future. Many of you will recall the beautiful words written by a student on the walls of Berkeley university campus: ‘The future interests me because that is where I plan to live’.</p>
      <p sl="it">We, too – here and now – can do something for our youth and for their future. Who can be satisfied that European expenditure for the young represents a mere 0.5% of our budget? That is why we must introduce a European youth pact, increasing measures to foster knowledge, training, language learning and access to the employment market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Discussions are taking place with the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, the Commission and the Council, on the possibility of extending the Erasmus programme to secondary school pupils, of launching an Erasmus for young entrepreneurs and of following up a pilot project promoting the mobility of young apprentices. However, I am also thinking of pilot projects providing access to credit through ethical and solidarity-based financing and measures to prepare small companies to face the new situations defined in the Basle agreements.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, we must agree that the Union’s traditional tasks and priorities have to be reconciled with the new priorities for external action, from the provision of further aid to Afghanistan and Iraq to support for countries hit by the tsunami or other natural disasters. Otherwise, how can we maintain a high and adequate level of financing for the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle East and the Balkans, or for development and humanitarian aid measures, for action to combat poverty and the diseases linked to it, for the respect for human rights and the struggle against terrorism – to name but a few major commitments – while at the same time providing what we have promised to Afghanistan, Iraq and South-East Asia, without adequate financial provision under heading 4?</p>
      <p sl="it">We, the members of the Committee on Budgets, believe that there can be a natural and inherent convergence in these areas between current budget concerns and a positive agreement with the Commission’s stance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Things which may appear logical, natural and rightful do not always have an easy passage, however. All too often, there are other considerations that take precedence, sectional interests and selfish calculations which prevail over this great joint project, which we can, and must, develop together. Perhaps all it would need is for each of us to take the trouble every day to do a simple little calculation, one requiring no calculator, a very quick sum which always gives the same result, namely a comparison of the costs of Europe with the costs of no Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">We shall do our part and I hope that at the end of the process, thanks to everyone’s contribution, we shall obtain a result which is positive for the European institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the 2006 budget will be the last one under this framework financial perspective both for the Commission and us all, and in a few weeks’ time in its preliminary draft budget, the Commission will propose only those preparations that it considers necessary. I thank Mr Pittella for having formed a very balanced approach; it is a step in the direction of achieving the platform of priorities common to both the Commission and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission adopted the APS 2006 decision on 2 March. For the Commission’s APS, this will frame both the PDB and the work programme for 2006 in line with the Commission’s five-year strategic objective. In particular, the first APS priority is focused on improving the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, as you also mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now it is Parliament’s turn to put forward its guidelines, and from Mr Pittella’s report I am pleased to see that the positions of Parliament and the Commission are close on many issues. The Commission’s general approach to the preparation of the 2006 budget will be mainly concentrated on five priorities. Firstly, to keep modulation for the Commission’s proposals to reinforce the ceilings for agriculture. Secondly, on payment appropriations, the Commission will base its position on the most reliable estimates of needs, and will report on the implementation of the funds in 2005 by July. Thirdly, on internal policies, Parliament’s priorities are globally shared by the Commission and will be reflected in its proposal, while leaving the margin under the ceiling well over EUR 100 million, including the youth policies, as already mentioned today. Fourthly, on external action, the needs are once again significant. That means that the Commission will call for the use of the flexibility instrument.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as regards human resources, we hear that there is a new proposal and that the Commission subscribes fully to the analysis made by the previous Commission. This was presented in 2002 in a communication on the consequences of enlargement on human resources. Parliament has also acknowledged the legitimacy of this request by inserting the principle of 3900 new posts for the EU-10 enlargement in the budgetary remarks of the 2005 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our mind there is no need for a review just one year after accession, but we need to implement what we have jointly agreed with Parliament. On this basis, for 2006, the Commission confirms the request of 700 new posts for the current enlargement and, in addition, it will request 100 external staff for preparing the next enlargement to remain in Bulgaria. The Commission will cooperate closely with the rapporteur and the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and with the other arms of the budget authority to agree in December on the 2006 budget for the European Union and its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, last year and this year there have been a great deal of problems relating to poverty eradication, Aids, malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases and the tsunami. The Millennium Project’s ‘quick wins’, which we have put into our budget opinion acknowledges that often the simplest ideas turn out to be the best. Too often in politics we see the quest for headline-grabbing initiatives taking priority over what should be the actual aim.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome what this ‘quick wins’ budgetary proposal involved because the result of the investment into the quick wins programmes is visible after two years. That means giving out malaria bed nets, free primary education and fertiliser, and promoting basic hygiene. These are simple things that we can do quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Water and sanitation are also critical for human welfare. One hygiene measure that I feel particularly strongly about is hand washing. This is not a glamorous subject. Hand washing with soap is not an innovative idea, but diarrhoeal diseases kill 2 million children every year. Hand washing with soap and water can reduce this by 47%. A million lives per year can be saved.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we strive towards the development goals, these are simple projects that I ask the Commission to put into place, which will make a huge difference over the vast quantities of money that we have already spent under the EDF and the Community development budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another under-utilised resource we need to concentrate on is the European Investment Bank. The EIB has the capacity to lend money. It can lend three times as much as the World Bank. The world knows about the World Bank but knows nothing about the European Investment Bank. Therefore I have put into the budget a grant element to support the interest on the EIB’s lending.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Committee on International Trade shares the general concern expressed by the Committee on Budgets that the Community, having made promises to third countries, ensures that there are adequate resources in the budget to meet these promises.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Pittella is to be congratulated on the external element of his report, but the Trade Committee has three specific points that are not, in our opinion, adequately covered in the report. Firstly, the World Trade talks are going to come to a conclusion in the next year or two and they will go through a crucial phase at the end of this year. We believe that to have credibility these talks need a parliamentary dimension and for a parliamentary dimension to be successful it needs to be funded, so we would like to see more money in the budget to cover the parliamentary dimension of the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the macro-financial assistance that goes to third countries, most particularly to Bosnia and Herzegovina, does not, in our opinion, have an adequate legal base and it is not properly monitored. We believe we need the codecision procedure implemented for this to bring transparency and accountability to this important area of expenditure. Finally, for a long time we have had an executive trading programme for Japan and Korea which has enabled us to get access to these markets. We believe it is now time to extend these programmes to cover China and India.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, as draftsman for the Committee on Fisheries, my first task is to express our regret that fisheries do not appear amongst the issues dealt with in the annual political statement.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fact is that this sector, which is crucial to many European regions, is facing problems that urgently require decisive action at Community level to protect the income and employment of fishing communities and coastal areas. Furthermore, 2006 is a crucial transitional year for the reform of the common fisheries policy, which will have a new financial instrument: the European Fisheries Fund. The allocation planned for this Fund seems to us to be clearly insufficient to meet our needs, which include improving the control of the application of the legislation, greater guarantees in the field of data protection, as well as quality and objectivity in scientific information and, furthermore, we are being asked to guarantee sustainable development and proper management of natural resources, as well as support for the implementation of the new regional councils. We believe it to be essential to increase the budgetary resources for the CFP, in order to deal with the real needs of a Europe of 27.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as the PPE-DE Group’s shadow rapporteur on the Annual Policy Strategy for 2006, I would like to thank and congratulate my colleague, Mr Pittella, for the excellent work he has done in preparing the documents we are now discussing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Annual Policy Strategy presented by the Commission in March establishes the Commission’s policy priorities for 2006, identifies the initiatives that will help to achieve them, and adopts the budgetary framework so that the priorities receive the necessary resources. It is important to know that this is the first APS adopted by the new Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">At EU level 2006 will be critical with regard to the implementation of the five EU strategic objectives adopted by Parliament, including the Lisbon Strategy, the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Social Agenda (2006-2010), as well as the achievement of the main target of restored growth and jobs in Europe. A review of the Hague Programme, linked to the entry into force of the Constitution, is already foreseen for the second half of 2006. In addition, the EU enlargement process will enter into a new phase and the European Neighbourhood Policy will be deepened.</p>
      <p sl="de">The year 2006 will be critical in preparing for the 2007-13 Financial Perspective period, to ensure adequate programming, and establishing a new generation of financial instruments to be fully operational on 1 January 2007.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our priorities for 2006 are the following: prosperity and solidarity; security within the Union; a more competitive and cohesive Europe; a Europe that is stronger in the world. Our budgetary strategy – its principles as well as sectoral priorities – are clearly identified in the report and a motion for a resolution that concerns structural operations, internal policies, agriculture, external actions as well as personnel and administration.</p>
      <p sl="de">I thank Mr Pittella for his cooperation and I support his report and motion for a resolution with the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group and, in particular, an amendment that calls on the Commission to present by 31 July a review of the medium-term staff needs related to the requested new posts.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, Madam President, I wanted to say that I very much regret that this essential report is being debated in the plenary at such a late hour.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wanted to congratulate Mr Pittella on this report and also for succeeding in the by no means trivial task of anticipating the Commission’s communication on its annual strategy some time ago. We do indeed want to continue to identify the European Union’s priorities, be successful in our continuing work on enlargement and above all succeed in re-launching the Lisbon policy. Mr Pittella has also succeeded in taking account of the current status of the negotiations on the future financial perspective. The objectives set out by the Commission in its communication are ambitious. But already we fear that the budgetary resources will not be commensurate with our hopes. For us, re-launching the Lisbon Strategy means above all creating high-quality jobs. We will therefore pay particular attention to assessing how realistic the aid to SMEs and micro-enterprises is and how it will be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you to our rapporteur for introducing a new notion into our budget: ethical financing instruments. The European Union should continue and indeed consolidate all of those actions that help to create social cohesion and promote human rights everywhere, as well as those that give our young people and our citizens opportunities to meet each other and listen to each other, thus gaining a better understanding of our culture and European identity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am keen that we should continue to work with the Commission to set up pilot projects and preparatory actions. If we are to do so, we will also need to find new and better forms of communication. So far, despite our requests, the results really have fallen short of our expectations. The Commission needs to develop a professional strategy to meet our needs, which are to inform the public regularly about our political projects and the decisions taken by the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before concluding, I should like to draw your attention to the amendment that we will be putting to the vote tomorrow. The solidarity fund should be available to all European citizens, regardless of where they are in the world, if disaster strikes. When providing aid, the European Union should keep its word and remember the commitments it has made about its objectives, in particular when it comes to giving development aid to the poorest countries of the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also need to support democratic change in those countries that expect European Union support. There too, we are going to lack sufficient resources. This year, once again, the ball will be in the Council’s court. We hope that it proves to be equal to its promises and commitments. The role of the European Union depends on it, as does the credibility, for our citizens, of our promises and projects.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I for my part should also like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Pittella, who has done a great job on this report and who has an even greater task ahead of him. After all, 2006 is a special year in budgetary terms because it is the last year falling under the ‘Agenda 2000’ budgetary framework. This means that, in certain respects, we have a limited degree of freedom. There are a number of issues, however, that are raised year after year. We in Parliament must once again make efforts to ensure that the payment appropriations required for the structural policy are in place. Last year, we saw that, in fact, more money was needed than was budgeted for. The funding of the decentralised agencies is another recurring problem, as we saw in the negotiations concerning the 2005 budget. This is something for which a solution needs to be found. Finally, there is the problem of funding new priorities and new tasks that arise, such as the reconstruction following the tsunami.</p>
      <p sl="da">We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe attach great importance to the Lisbon Process and particularly to the programmes in which we develop the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises through the European Investment Fund, because a fairly low level of resources in the budget has a very great dispersal effect and secures economic growth in a way that is very cheap for the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="da">Where EU foreign policy is concerned, we consider it very important to give the combating of HIV/AIDS high priority in the budget. We also believe that the budget should particularly support the EU’s neighbourhood policy, so that we promote democracy and human rights in the countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I should like to mention the EU information policy, for which special efforts and particular attention are also required. In this area, we must, in particular, develop cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, I shall not thank Mr Pittella yet; I shall thank him later on, in December. These are only the first kilometres of a long marathon.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The rapporteur has been in touch with different groups and investigated their focus areas for the preparation of the budget. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left consider it important that social and economic solidarity is strengthened, as well as environmental policy. We give our support to the rapporteur in his endeavours to give these issues priority in the budget. Our group understands all too well that adequate payment appropriations should be secured to finance all payment commitments made.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We would like to remind the representatives of the Council of the fact that, if no agreement on this budget or on the financial perspective in future years are reached, according to the current basic agreement, payment appropriations will in any case be 1.06% of the GNP. As seen from the point of view of Parliament, there is no point in the Council proposing any lower payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I want to mention the financing of the Natura 2000 programme, one of the rapporteur’s focus areas. It is unclear how funds are being allocated for the purposes of the programme. I agree with the rapporteur that we should cautiously prepare for new Community-subsidised areas. Today nobody knows how joint funding is used for Natura 2000 or how exactly the costs should be shared between the Member States and the Union. It would be reasonable, if Member States with large populations and few Natura areas would, through the EU, contribute towards the protection of our common European natural environment in the more sparsely populated Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The view of our group is negative as regards the financing of any expenditure to militarise the Union or which, protected by the smoke screen of information services, is used to finance propaganda to support the federal development of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is equally frustrating each time EU budget issues are debated. Demands for increased appropriations for new areas of expenditure are put forward without the basic problems being dealt with.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Allow me to remind you of three such problems. Firstly, almost half of EU expenditure goes on an agricultural policy that all sensible people without vested interests in the issue have to regard as completely unreasonable. Secondly, almost another third goes on regional aid to rich countries. There is no way in which we can agree to increasing the Member States’ contributions to the EU as long as most of the money that is now paid in is used in this directly damaging way. Thirdly, the problems are not analysed in a sensible, sociological way. The basic attitude here is to throw money at problems. Often, however – and perhaps more often than not – it is systems of rules that determine how the economy operates, not money from the state. We must allow the countries themselves to decide on these issues. That is what democracy is about.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union incorporating 10 new States was unquestionably an extraordinary event in our shared history. At no point during those negotiations, which were clearly not easy, did any country put their national interests before what some people describe as the reunification of Europe, however legitimate they may have been. This is demonstrated by the fact that the most difficult chapters of that negotiation were concluded during the Spanish Presidency of the Union, which until then had been the biggest net receiver of funds.</p>
      <p sl="es">It has been calculated that the enlargement has cost as much as EUR 200 000 million. During this debate the European Commission has been called upon to explain how it proposes to distribute this sum amongst the 15 old Member States. Because the confirmed information that we have had access to demonstrates that the European Commission's proposal in this regard is not fair.</p>
      <p sl="es">Is it not the case that it is proposed that Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece pay a sum that, compared to their GDP, is three times the Union average, is much greater than that proposed for all the net contributors and, for example, is four times the sum proposed for Germany? If that is the case, Commissioner, the European Commission has the responsibility to propose, within the negotiations on the renewal of the financial perspectives, a compensation mechanism for these countries to alleviate the effects of the sharp fall in their net income from the Union and thus to prevent any risk to their process of true convergence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although enlargement has obviously presented the European Union’s regional policy with huge challenges, we are doing our best to rise to them. At the same time, however, we should never lose sight of the fact that regional policy is the most publicly visible of all the EU’s policies, which means that it is our responsibility to press ahead with this policy in a sensible and sustainable manner.</p>
      <p sl="de">A few moments ago Mr Galeote Quecedo referred to the costs this will involve. I would argue that the unavoidable costs of a round of enlargement of this kind must be shared in a reasonably fair manner. In order for this to happen, we need both to show solidarity with the regions, which no longer play as large a part in structural and cohesion policy as they have done in recent years, and to avoid making excessive demands of the EU Member States commonly known as net contributors. I need to be able to explain to my fellow countrymen why the money that Germany contributes to the EU is a good investment. At the same time as enlisting support at home, however, I also need to ensure that the EU appreciates that the situation is a great deal more complex than it may have been ten years ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, therefore, the proposals issued by the Commission, relating to a correction mechanism under which the burden on net contributors would be eased somewhat, are extremely significant. I believe that more serious thought should be given in future to a reorganisation of the own resources system and to a move away from current costs and procedures, and this applies to the Council of Ministers as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that consideration should be given to the use of cofinancing for agriculture measures, in order to ensure that changes are made to procedures in this field as well. The first steps have in fact been taken in this direction in the Financial Perspective and in the Böge report. At the same time, however, I would note that it is the responsibility of this House to manage money as efficiently as possible, and to pay close attention to what this money is spent on. The n+2 rule will play a key role in this respect, in particular in terms of accountability to net contributors and the responsible use of taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that today’s debate will help us to negotiate the Financial Perspective and formulate regional policy, and that we will stand together in showing solidarity to one another.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The existence of a consistent and adequately-funded Community regional policy is essential if the EU is to help reduce the regional disparities accentuated by recent enlargements and to contribute towards real convergence in different countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regional policy is a necessary and equitable instrument that offsets the adverse impact of the internal market on the least economically developed regions and countries. In light of the fact that the more prosperous Member States will derive substantial benefit from enlargement, while cohesion countries, such as Portugal and Greece will be most affected by the costs of enlargement at macroeconomic level, and in turn by the threat of a possible reduction in structural funds as part of budgetary restrictions and by the 'statistical effect', I should like to ask the Commission the following.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Does it not think that far greater financial resources are required than the amounts proposed for regional policy in its 2007-2013 financial framework to meet the needs of the enlargement and to guarantee effective cohesion policy? What measures does the Commission intend to take in support of the countries, such as Portugal and Greece, most affected by enlargement? Does it intend to set up specific programmes geared to helping them develop and modernise their economies in the context of an enlarged EU, as has happened previously? Is the Commission prepared to uphold the idea of full compensation for the 'statistical effect' or guarantee that regions affected by the 'statistical effect' receive the support they would have if eligibility were calculated on the basis of a 15-member EU, given that no region should feel disadvantaged by enlargement?</p>

    <intervention id="2-342" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Hübner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I know it is very late but as the questions the honourable Members have raised require detailed replies, I shall, if you will allow me, use the time allowed at the end of the debate in addition to the time allowed for my introductory remarks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even though the importance of the impact of enlargement cannot be assessed only in budgetary terms, I understand the will expressed by Members to have a better understanding, for the sake of transparency and non-discrimination, of the Commission’s budgetary proposal in the context of enlargement. Enlargement has financial implications and we need a financial effort at EU level. However, let us be clear that the impact of enlargement also concerns other dimensions. I agree that the Union’s budget for the period 2007-2013 must be sufficient to guarantee the economic convergence of the 10, which I am convinced will be for the good of all 25 Member States. It is clear that the size of the overall budgetary envelope for 2007-2013, and the size of the envelope for cohesion policy in this context, matters a great deal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Will we have sufficient funds for 2007-2013? We never have enough funds, because Europe’s needs are enormous. But in reality we know that we do not have all the money in the world; nor do we have the absorption capacities that would allow us to spend much more money in an efficient way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to stress that, some months ago, the Commission tabled a proposal under which every euro is well thought through and justified. That is why we consider the proposal to be well balanced and well prepared, including with regard to cohesion policy, and a basis for addressing the needs, problems and challenges that the enlarged Europe with a hundred million more citizens will face now and in the future. That is my reaction to your comment on whether we have enough money. I very much agree with Mrs Krehl’s comments on the efficient use of public and taxpayers’ money. We also have to think about the budget in terms of the efficiency and quality of its spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we think about the cost of enlargement, I always feel tempted to remind you that the ten new Member States have fully contributed to the Union’s budget, including to the existing correction mechanism, in line with common rules. When you look at the policies that the new Member States are gradually introducing into major Union policies, we must remember that enlargement has already been taken into consideration from the point of view of the contribution to the financing of policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">When preparing the proposal for 2007-2013, the Commission took into account all the budgetary developments linked to enlargement. In reply to your question of whether the Commission proposal constitutes equal treatment of the Member States in the context of cohesion policy, I should like to briefly mention the six basic principles on which we based our approach to the distribution of the costs and of the potential benefits when preparing the budget. These principles allow a fair distribution of the effects of enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the Commission has sought to guarantee the necessary means to finance economic convergence and cohesion in an enlarged, more diversified Europe. Secondly, the Commission has taken account of the economic fact of life that there are regions in the 15 Member States that have not yet completed the process of economic convergence. Thirdly, we strongly believe that a cohesion policy is also necessary for regions not subject to the convergence objective, whilst being guided by objective economic criteria and the ‘Berlin method’, as adjusted by the Commission. We also keep in mind the requirement that all Member States should be treated equitably in any final agreement. Fifthly, we believe that the cohesion policy should apply in a uniform way to all 25 Member States: we should not have one policy for the 10 Member States and another policy for the 15. Sixthly, the Commission remains aware that, for some Member States, difficulties will still need to be addressed in any final agreement in the course of the negotiations, again in the interests of overall fairness.</p>
      <p sl="en">We follow very closely, and, as you know, participate as much as the role of the Commission allows, in the negotiation process between Member States. We are prepared to contribute in an appropriate way and whenever necessary to any final agreement taking into account specific cases. At this stage, the Commission will not propose any special solution or compensation mechanism. However, if, in the course of the negotiations in the Council, such a mechanism or such programmes and projects were proposed, then the Commission would be more than willing to participate in contributing to the final design of such a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important and true that the distribution of financial resources amongst Member States reflects in principle and in general the relative social and economic situation of each region and Member State, and they are measured by well-known indicators. I do not want to list them, but let me stress that the Commission has recognised that in certain cases final allocations will be affected by factors other than objective socio-economic circumstances in regions or Member States. As you know, according to recent statistics, 16 out of 254 regions with more than 60 million inhabitants will feel the statistical effect of enlargement. In these cases, the Commission has proposed an ad-hoc solution, namely creating a specific transitional scheme at regional level and adjusting certain parameters of the ‘Berlin method’. As a result, the Commission’s proposal for the statistical-phasing out regions represents a very limited reduction: an average of only 6% of what these regions would have received were they fully eligible for the convergence objective in the 2007-2013 period</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the Commission’s current proposal. My concern is to maintain this proposal. As we hear, there are many other ideas, including in the Member States. Many consider this proposal to be too generous. We are, therefore, focusing very much on defending this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the adjustment of the ‘Berlin method’, another instrument the Commission has used in its aim to share out fairly the effects of enlargement, we have also managed to increase the overall financial envelope by EUR 16 billion. This adjustment reflects the statistical effect of enlargement on the way we take into account the national prosperity factor in our calculations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also say that some of the reductions in the allocations, which are perceived by regions to be a consequence of enlargement, are not a result of enlargement, because there are 12 regions with 18 million people whose GDP has increased over the years faster than the Community average. Today, those regions will come under Objective 2. As a result, we have on the table today a budget that is more or less equally divided between the old and the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">All the above elements confirm that the Commission’s proposal addresses the question of an equitable distribution of the effects of the enlargement at the same time –which is important for us – as preserving the objective nature of the method of allocation based on Community-level statistics.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also react to what you, and in particular Mrs Krehl, said with regard to the balances on own-resources. Those issues clearly come under the responsibility of Dalia Grybauskaitė. I know that she would be delighted to exchange views with you on this. However, it must be said that although budgetary balances do not provide a complete picture of all the advantages stemming from Union membership, the Commission is aware that discussions on this subject are a reality and play an important role in the public debates in some of the Member States. That is why the Commission’s proposal on the system for financing the EU budget in terms of revenue, which is not my responsibility, should also be seen as a compromise solution, which is intended as a kind of safety net.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have stressed the importance of net balances and you suggest a link between the regional policy and the allocation of funds and the net balances. To put this bluntly, this is not the best approach to regional policy, because we pursue regional policy in order to reduce disparities in accordance with Article 158 and not to solve the net balance questions. That is why we should not mix these discussions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner Hübner has tried to give us answers on an issue which does not strictly come within her remit because, despite the title, the content of the question mainly concerns her colleague, Mrs Grybauskaitė, as she herself said at some point. I think that this is an error on the part of the Conference of Presidents, which has given the question the wrong title. Nonetheless, I shall overlook this matter in order to say that the basic message that the question wanted to send out is that burdens which arise in general in the new period of the financial perspectives should be distributed fairly between the Member States. I would say that not only the cohesion countries to date should be victims, but also the new Member States, which will need to be dealt with fairly, and I am not sure that this is always the case.</p>
      <p sl="el">In all events, I should like to make three brief comments on the matter. First, there are certainly significant reductions as regards the cohesion countries in relation to their income from the European Union's regional policy and I welcome, within this framework, the Commissioner's hint, even if it was only a hint, that the Commission is willing at least to discuss some sort of compensation mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, it is to my mind scandalous that we should still have this British exemption in the budget, which is why I believe that there should also be a global debate at some point on the own resources system.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, and lastly, I think that it is clear from the debate so far that Parliament needs to hold a broader debate in the immediate future, so that the papers going round the Commission corridors on the issues touched on by the question can be debated more broadly and so that we all know what the issues are and can establish the injustices against the cohesion countries and the regions of the European Union which are lagging behind from the development point of view.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I share the Commissioner’s fear that we do not have enough time to deal with such an important issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">It goes without saying that the 15 old Member States were in a position to deal with the enlargement. Nevertheless, as previous speakers have mentioned, it is the case that the countries that largely paid for this enlargement are going to lose the contributions from the Cohesion Fund as a result of the statistical effect.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am delighted that the Commissioner, Mrs Hübne, has said that, in the negotiations with the Council, she will try to create some compensation instrument or gradual phasing out, as we have seen with the regional funds. Because, in the case of Spain for example, this loss of Cohesion Fund is particularly dramatic, since there will be a sudden drop in its net operative income equivalent to 0.91% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this Commission proposal, and this is what our question expresses, the signatories — including myself — express their concern at the unfair distribution of the financial cost of enlargement; the concern that the principle contained in the recent conclusions of the European Council, which urges fairness in funding, is being violated.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the regional and structural policies of the EU are based on Article 158 of the EC Treaty, which states that the Community will pursue its actions to strengthen economic and social cohesion. The Article is the EU’s life insurance policy. It endeavours to guarantee that all regions benefit, that the ‘win-win’ principle is established. It justifies the very existence of the entire EU. Should certain regions or population groups repeatedly find that they are excluded from general development, the consequence would be disintegration of unity in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When the last ten new Member States joined the European Union, its population grew by over 20%, but GNP increased by only 5%. For historical reasons, the GNP per capita in all new Member States was somewhat clearly below the EU average. That is why the regional and structural policies of the EU must be targeted at the new Member States, and for that reason all new Member States are initially net gainers.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the financial perspective and in the plans of the Commission, a significant amount of investment has been allocated to the new Member States, and after a few years they would jointly receive more regional and structural policy funding than the old Member States. This trend must be considered absolutely the correct one.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is the danger, however, that the weakest regions in the EU will lose out on regional and structural policy measures. In absolute terms, nevertheless, they will not have become more prosperous or developed in any measure, even though regions even weaker than they have joined the Union. There is a risk, therefore, that the weakest regions in the EU will have to pay more for enlargement than the wealthiest regions, because their contribution to the EU budget is in relation to their GNP, and, in addition to that, they are losing funding they have received from it. This would seem to apply to the EU’s sparsely populated northern regions in particular.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, speaking as a German Member of this House, I support the Commission’s proposal on the Financial Perspective. The reason for this is that I am in favour of solidarity between the regions, something reflected in a great many aspects of the proposal. Regional policy also provides for solidarity between the regions, yet in my opinion, and in that of our group, the Cohesion Fund is not the best source of funding for solidarity-related measures, in that it lacks a programme-based approach. It would be far preferable to use the Structural Funds for this purpose, as this would facilitate more targeted responses to the problems experienced by the regions, as well as higher quality implementation and an efficient use of funding.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has incorporated a great many of the criticisms Parliament made of the Cohesion Fund into the new proposal. I therefore believe that this is a well-balanced proposal, and, even though I come from a Member State that is a net contributor, I can endorse it. In my opinion, excessive demands would be counterproductive in this instance, as they do not bring about the desired results; instead, they lead to blockages of the kind we are currently experiencing. We want this Financial Perspective to be adopted as quickly as possible, yet the House is having to join with the Commission in fighting against the net contributors that are in favour of a 1% budget. In my opinion, adopting such an approach at present is counterproductive in the extreme.</p>

      <p sl="en">The motivation for and the intention of the Structural Funds and the EU’s regional policy was to assist regions and countries in overcoming disparities and in developing their social and economic potential. Could the Commissioner confirm if this motivation will continue to inform the EU’s regional policy in the future? Does she regard the means to be sufficient to cope with it? There are 68 million people across the EU who continue to live in poverty, according to the European Anti-Poverty Network. This remains a huge challenge for us.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, no allowance has been made in the provisions of the European Regional Development Fund adopted to date by the European Parliament and the European Council for EU funding to be used to cover the costs of housing-related investment. Measures that do not qualify for funding under the ERDF include the adapting, converting or renovating of buildings for housing purposes, even though expenditure on such measures is a heavy burden on the budgets of the new Member States. Available figures show that over one third of the citizens of these countries live in high-rise buildings, which were the most widespread form of housing in the former Communist states, yet the condition of these blocks is deteriorating sharply. The standard of living of the people living in these buildings is dropping because there is no money to modernise them, and the buildings are also energy-inefficient and bad for the environment. The EU ministers with responsibility for building-related matters who met in Prague in March 2005 asked the European Commission whether funding could be made available in order to provide at least a partial solution to this problem. I should therefore like to ask how the Commission intends to approach this issue.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, one of the goals enshrined in the EU Treaties is the promotion of social, economic and territorial cohesion and solidarity between Member States. There are a great many challenges currently facing the European Union, which include global competition, an ageing society and the development of a knowledge-based economy. Yet there can be no question that one of the most important is the widening development gap between European regions, and even within these regions. This problem is due not only to the fact that new and relatively poor Central and Eastern European countries have joined the EU, giving rise to a sudden increase in disparities. The gap between different regions has been widening for many years, and this also holds true for the old Member States. The aim of the EU’s cohesion policy is to prevent such disparities, yet we should not forget that cohesion policy also implements key political goals, as well as having a sound economic base. European integration is founded on the principle of solidarity, and the most important aspect of solidarity is the desire for cohesion. European solidarity is the basis of European integration, and without it Europe would be nothing but a customs union. Cohesion policy should therefore be the main priority of the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, and funding should be targeted at the poorest regions and countries, as the primary function of cohesion policy must be to close development gaps between regions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An appropriate level of funding must be guaranteed in order to implement development goals effectively. The new Financial Perspective must respond to the changes that have occurred, and it must make allowance for the fact that the European Union’s population increased one year ago by over 70 million inhabitants of less-developed regions. At the same time, regulatory changes must be made before any proposals to limit the EU’s budget are adopted. A simple rule should be applied in this instance, namely that a smaller budget means less state interference in the economy and completion of the common market. To my surprise, however, some of the Member States calling for a reduction in the minimum expenditure threshold, for example France and Germany, are also opposing the establishment of a genuine common market in services, as set out in the draft services directive, for example.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recent enlargement probably represents the greatest challenge that the EU has ever faced. What is needed is vision, leadership and community spirit so that we can best meet the needs and address the consequences of the enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The challenges of completing the internal market and European economic and monetary union were met with just such a firm response, when funding for the Structural Funds was doubled. If we are to meet the challenge of a viable enlarged Europe, regional development policy must once again take centre stage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is crucial that the policy of economic and social cohesion be strengthened and reinvigorated, in order to combat the enormous regional imbalances following the accession of many poorer regions of the new Member States, and to continue to address the problem that various regions in the old Member States still lag behind.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The latter aspect cannot be underestimated, particularly given that the regional imbalances might increase in the old EU of 15 Member States as a result of the dynamics created by the enlargement. This is especially true of relations between outlying and central regions; in other words, while countries such as Portugal and Spain became more peripheral, and the central countries gained extra centrality. In fact, it is estimated that, as far as the EU of the 15 is concerned, the wealthier, more central countries have benefited most from the enlargement, and countries such as Portugal, Spain and Greece are probably those that have benefited least, or have in fact lost out.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore return to the issues raised in the oral question, as I do not feel that the Commission has provided adequate responses. Has the Commission calculated the cost-benefit ratio for each EU Member State? If so, does the Commission not think that ways should be found of compensating countries in which the costs clearly exceed the benefits?</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I too would like to thank Commissioner Hübner for her reply. However, I believe that certain matters need further clarification.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is true that the historically necessary reunification of Europe, which we all ardently supported, must not promote new dividing lines and disturb the internal cohesion of the European Union, for which we have all worked all these years.</p>
      <p sl="el">The evidence shows that the cost of enlargement is not being divided fairly and proportionately between all the Member States. Countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are suffering serious repercussions, which may take on dramatic proportions if the final agreement on the new financial perspectives digresses from the European Commission's original proposals. I think that this is also the crucial issue for Commissioner Hübner, as she herself said. However, in the final analysis, the issue will be judged primarily on the final amount of the Community budget and the extent to which it will be able to adequately finance the Structural Funds and, subsequently, on how we will manage to ensure that there will be satisfactory financing to facilitate the continuation of development in the regions suffering the real repercussions of enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="el">We note from your reply that these issues concern you, but we would like greater clarification as regards the issue to which you too referred, by which I mean the financial compensation mechanism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I support the Commission proposals on cohesion in its widest sense, namely statistical effect. I should like to ask Mrs Hübner if she could shed some light on rumours that discussions are taking place within the Council to interpret the Commission’s proposals on statistical effect to cover areas of Germany and Greece, but to exclude areas such as the Highlands, Islands and the south of Scotland?</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a crying shame that the government of the United Kingdom cannot be anywhere near as constructive as the Commission proposals. The current UK Government is more intent on stabbing the Highlands, Islands and the south of Scotland in the back rather than fighting their corner. The Scottish Government has been notable only by its absence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The principles of solidarity and cohesion across all 25 Member States of the European Union state that no region should be discriminated against. I would ask the Commission and the Council to reassure me that, despite the best efforts of the United Kingdom Government, no Scottish region will be discriminated against, and that the principles of statistical effect will apply as proposed by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the majority of my political group considers 0.41% to be inadequate to finance the objectives of cohesion, which is why we consider any intention of reducing this sum unthinkable. The cost of enlargement also needs to be divided fairly, which means that the cohesion countries and regions must not be treated unfairly and the scandal of the British exemption must be ended at long last. We are calling for strong financial compensation mechanisms from the Commission, which must also work on this idea, strong support during the transitional period of the convergence regions and for the problem of the regions which fall victim to the so-called statistical effect to be properly addressed at long last. Anyway, the financial cost is small. Finally, as the objective of cohesion also aims for territorial cohesion, I think that areas at a geographical disadvantage need special care and treatment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have the money we want or need to spend on regional policy, and so we must do a good job of sharing out the money we do have in a prudent and correct fashion. Money is of course the main issue at stake with regard to regional policy, but other key issues include setting political objectives and reducing disparities within individual EU regions, with the latter having acquired particular significance since enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question we should be asking is whether we want a coherent EU that is capable of developing more rapidly, or an EU where the differences are more pronounced and where the economic and political integration of the poorer regions proceeds at an even slower rate. Putting it bluntly, unless more money is earmarked for the Structural Funds following enlargement, the new Member States will always be tempted to block decisions to drive integration forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">To put it another way, the amount of funding allocated to the EU’s structural policy must allow adequate support to be provided, both now and in the future, to less developed regions that have particular social and economic problems, whether such regions are situated in the current EU or in new Member States. As I have already said, this means that funding must be distributed fairly and channelled towards solving the most serious problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although on the whole we agree with the Commission’s proposals for distributing funds between the various objectives, they can of course apply only if the total amount of funding is on the scale proposed by the Commission. If funds were to be distributed in this way and cuts made to total funding, as proposed by certain Member States, this would have an extremely harmful impact on the priority convergence regions in the old EU Member States. This is something we could not and will not stand for.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, regional policy has played a key, well-defined role ever since the EU took its first tentative steps. Even at that time, the principle of solidarity existed and was a key aspect that set our worldview apart. The objective has always been to ensure that no region is ever left behind in the name of a simplistic and fatalistic vision.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For this very reason, all Member States and regions have always been committed to developing and to making their development models sustainable. Today we all want more and there are more of us. Is it either reasonable or rational to expect that, following so much effort towards European cohesion, we are going to be wealthier because there are more of us? As European citizens we do not want only to look at the cosmetic appearance; we want to look at the substance and the structure, and this means not abandoning all of those regions which have yet to complete the process of real convergence and which, due to a simplistic financial outlook, seem to want to become rich overnight.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must also bear in mind that regional policy and the Lisbon Strategy must overlap; it is crucial that strong links be established between these two objectives if they are to be effective. Measuring growth in purely financial terms is both artificial and unsustainable; on the other side of that coin, sustainable development implies convergence and competitiveness. If we place emphasis on competitiveness, leaving behind those who have only recently started to stand on their own two feet, those countries will fall back down and will not have the strength to get up again alone. For us, for all of the citizens of this Europe of solidarity, competitiveness must not replace convergence. Nor must competitiveness replace a more visible regional policy. What is needed is solidarity with many regions such as the Algarve, the Highlands, the Asturias region and Madeira, and many other European regions that in theory became rich overnight.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is typical that the issues raised in this question relating to the previous enlargement are being debated the day before the final decisions are taken on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013. It comes as no surprise to us that Members from the old EU Member States have asked for a country-by-country analysis of the financial consequences of the last enlargement, and we are aware that these questions are also an indication of the fact that people expect the Commission to monitor and assess the consequences of any future enlargements. I am very much in favour of questions of this kind being asked, yet at the same time I should like to alert this House to the need to consider not only the costs and liabilities that show up on the balance sheet, but also the benefits derived by the old EU Member States. These benefits include, inter alia , a growth in trade, in capital investment and in the market for large-scale procurement, as well as greater environmental protection, and it is quite likely that some countries have derived more benefits than others. Rigorous financial analysis is indispensable, but we must not encourage those who see the European Union merely in terms of costs and liabilities. It should also be seen in terms of the benefits it provides on the basis of fairly distributed costs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Many thanks, Madam President, esteemed Commissioner. I share the concern of my colleagues, as expressed in the question presented to the Commission. In order to meet the legitimate expectations of the citizens of the European Union, regional policy must be based on the interests of the European Union as a whole, and on a fair distribution of responsibilities, and I am grateful for Madam Commissioner’s confirmation that the ten new Member States have also made their contribution in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Constitution of the European Union provides for the strengthening of solidarity within the regions. Therefore it is important to maintain a balance, not only in the provision of funding to new and old members, but also in the funding of different regions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Mediterranean region, for instance, has for years received very extensive financial support, which is good and justified. However, it is not good that funding for the Nordic Dimension has been many times more modest, despite the fact that the Baltic Sea region is becoming the area with the greatest growth potential in the EU. The European Union has a Mediterranean strategy, in the same way that it has a Russia strategy. I would like to propose that the Commission should develop a separate strategy for the Baltic Sea region, and that this should be financed similarly to the Mediterranean strategy. This would provide a new balance in regional policy, because the Baltic Sea is becoming the Mediterranean of Northern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">One practical question concerning regional development – the eligibility of value added tax from the Cohesion Fund and the Regional Fund. In the Estonian context, leaving value added tax off the list of eligible expenditures significantly reduces the ability of small local governments to submit projects. This means that structural assistance will become 18% more expensive for them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, it is certainly not presumptuous to say today that by 1 p.m. tomorrow we will have adopted the final version of this directive on the ecodesign requirements for Energy-Using Products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This will give the European Union a new tool to promote innovation and protect the environment, because applying ecodesign requirements to domestic or construction products is the future. Over 80% of environmental pollution is caused during the manufacturing phase. It is therefore essential to act at the source, where the possibilities for technical improvements are the greatest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why Parliament has been in favour of this Commission proposal from the outset, and there are at least two reasons for this. The first is the very broad scope of application of the framework directive. It covers a wide range of products, that together are responsible for around 40% of CO2 emissions. These range from refrigerators to boilers and include computers, lights, lawnmower engines, and many more. All of the energy sources are covered and all of the sectors included.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text’s flexibility is the second reason. It seeks to promote the ecodesign approach within companies by means of voluntary agreements, but also with legislation if this self-regulation is not possible or when it has failed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore share, Commissioner, a desire to promote ecodesign, with a precise objective in mind: to improve the ecological quality of products without adversely affecting their working quality. There is of course no point in having a quieter washing machine if it consumes twice as much electricity or water, for example. That is why this directive is rightly based on an integrated approach, which consists of assessing the product from the cradle to the grave, because every product has an impact on the environment at some stage in its life cycle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This multi-criteria and multi-stage environmental balance sheet must not, however, prevent us, as legislators, from setting ourselves one or more priorities, and that is clearly what we did when we said that energy efficiency was a priority thematic area in the fight against climate change. We are making a vital contribution to the efforts being made to respect the Kyoto target here. Indeed, the Commission puts the reduction that we could achieve by 2010 thanks to this directive at almost 200 million tonnes of CO2.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That brings me to the agreement that we concluded last Monday after two marathon meetings with the Luxembourg Presidency, obviously in full cooperation with your services. This agreement has two major advantages, the first – not insignificant for the purses of our fellow citizens – being that we will avoid an expensive conciliation. The second, more fundamentally, is the fact that we now have a balanced compromise, which improves the Council’s common position on the essential points. To start with, as far as energy efficiency is concerned, it is provided that, in the next 24 months, even before the first work plan is drawn up, the Commission, after consulting the Consultation Forum, will adopt implementing measures for the categories of products where the potential for CO2 reductions is greatest, and as a priority for the seven categories of products cited in the European Climate Change Programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Market surveillance is also a top priority. Since this directive seeks to extend CE marking to Energy-Using Products that comply with ecodesign requirements, it is important to have effective product checks throughout the Union. The agreement now includes a clear definition of the notion of producer as well as a very clear article on the responsibilities of the importer. Furthermore, it provides for checks on all the commercial players in the chain, which have to be able to justify by means of a declaration of conformity that any product sold in Europe meets the ambitious energy efficiency criteria that we want to put in place. Of course all of these measures have just one objective: to sanitise the market and protect consumers. It is now up to the Member States to act quickly and effectively so as to pursue the bad boys and free riders and to defend European industry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A very brief comment on comitology: I welcome the fact that the Council has taken up our idea, expressed in Article 14, of setting up a Consultation Forum, whose powers are beefed up by this draft recommendation. This will make it possible for industry and the NGOs to monitor the situation carefully when it proves necessary to put implementing measures in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A further point: information should also be given to consumers and SMEs, two essential links in the economic chain, which have a crucial role to play in distributing these ecological products on the market. Consumers should be informed about the environmental performance of the products, and SMEs should be given financial and technical help to manufacture these more environmentally friendly products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have one final point, Mr Piebalgs, before I conclude. These are very early days as far as integrating the product life-cycle approach into company policy is concerned. We will therefore – and this is our opinion – need more than a Mr Ecodesign in your services if we are to make this project a success, and we have written to you stating this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will conclude, Madam President, by thanking – I think it is important to do so – the Council and in particular the Luxembourg Presidency. I should also like to thank the Commission for being a very wise arbitrator and all of my shadow rapporteurs, whose collaboration has been very valuable throughout these last 18 months. They have managed to keep Parliament united so that we could reach, or forge, this agreement, which puts the three pillars, the environmental, economic and social pillars, of sustainable development on an equal footing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, and the shadow rapporteurs for their commitment and constructive cooperation in the aim of reaching an agreement at this second reading. I believe this directive will deliver long-lasting benefits to consumers, and to the environment, by lowering our energy consumption and by producing more environmentally-sound products. The eco-design directive will also help EU industry to face worldwide challenges related to the environmental improvement of its products.</p>
      <p sl="en">Adding to what Parliament achieved with its first reading, the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, together with her colleagues and shadow rapporteurs, has negotiated a package of compromise amendments that, once accepted by the Council, will reshape the common position on essential issues. I refer in particular to the compromise amendments affecting Articles 12 and 13. These changes will assure a high level of environmental protection when setting eco-design requirements and introduce additional measures in favour of SMEs and to facilitate market surveillance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly satisfied that suitable wording was found to put a focus on the need to improve the energy efficiency of products, while still taking account of the integrated approach promoted by the directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have already made clear that energy efficiency is one of my main priorities. The eco-design framework is one of the most efficient tools we could use to reduce energy consumption and mitigate climate change. Obviously, Parliament wanted to be reassured that once the Commission had its mandate it would make good use of it. The common position amended by the package tabled will leave no ambiguity on that issue: the Commission will have to deliver and report back on its achievements. I can promise you that.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, and on a request from the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs during the most recent negotiations on the compromise package, I can also state that, without prejudice to the outcome of the ratification process of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which I am confident will take place, the Commission will examine the issue of the implementation of Articles 36 and 37 of the Constitution in relation to this framework directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe the European Parliament, through the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, has achieved a lot and this proposal should be supported by this House.</p>

      <p sl="de">We have reached a positive outcome that will allow us to accomplish a great deal for the environment. Following consultations with industry representatives and environmental groups, the Commission has estimated that the directive could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 180 million tonnes, which is equivalent to 53% of the European Union’s Kyoto target. During negotiations, we pushed for these reductions to be implemented to as great an extent as possible and without delay.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Group of the European People’s Party has always regarded this as an important directive, and we adopted a constructive approach from the very outset.

As a result of the first of these amendments, the directive will apply not only to producers in the European Union, but to all products that reach the European market, no matter where they have been manufactured. The second amendment will make importers subject to tighter checks and ensure that the fight against corruption is stepped up, in both instances to a greater degree than originally planned by the Commission and the Council. Our third amendment will result in the bureaucratic burden on businesses being reduced, with Annex I now being a great deal more business-friendly. This has earned us the thanks of small and medium-sized enterprises, and I have received a written statement from the latter expressing such sentiments.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact remains, however, that we have set ambitious goals for environmental protection, and I am particularly pleased that reducing stand-by losses has been identified as a top priority goal. An enormous amount of energy is being wasted through such losses, and it would be a simple matter to put a stop to them.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is now up to the Commission to get down to work without delay and to implement the directive. The Commissioner must also ensure that Commission officials have enough staff to do so promptly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, on behalf of my group, I should like to join the previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur. We all know that we have achieved a great deal together, and it is mainly thanks to her that we did so. The Council did not appear to be overly keen on reaching an agreement at second reading until a few weeks ago, and I believe that our awareness of what codecision entails set some wheels in motion in this respect. We were very conscious of the fact that the House must not allow itself to be intimidated by speeches given by certain Council members, and we were prepared to exercise our codecision rights and take the matter to the Conciliation Committee if it proved impossible to reach agreement beforehand in a civil manner.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Ries has already said that a balanced compromise has been achieved, and we spent the same amount of time negotiating the issue around two weeks ago as we will spend debating it today. Needless to say, I am less than happy with this compromise from the point of view of my group, yet I believe that we have achieved the best that we could. We have obviously had to sacrifice some of our demands for the sake of compromise, but I am delighted that Parliament has made sure that the common position now gives clear priority to energy efficiency, rather than referring to it in very vague terms. In my opinion, this is essential in order for this directive to deliver results.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also delighted that my demands for more consumer information were met. Mrs Ries has already said that it is important to provide consumers with information, for example on how energy can be saved when operating energy-using products, and many more such examples can be found. We are all aware that this directive is an effective instrument in the fight against climate change, yet at the same time we know that rigorous and effective parliamentary checks will be necessary in future, in order to ensure that the instrument upon which we have pinned so much hope will in fact be able to meet the demands we make of it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, and do not envy her the task she had of bringing about this compromise. Nevertheless, I do still have certain issues with this directive. In my opinion, there is no getting round the fact that the political course we are following in this directive will ultimately and primarily result in bureaucratic barriers to market entry rather than more environmentally friendly products, and in fewer businesses and jobs in the electronic and electrical engineering industries rather than greater environmental protection on the basis of reduced resource consumption.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are continuing to rely on product and process management instead of formulating clear criteria that make sense in terms of the end product. What is stopping us from giving technicians and engineers a free hand to come up with creative ideas in the search for the best technological concepts? We will only find the best available technology, whether environment-related or otherwise, if we place no obstacles in the way of competition. The kind of product policy that has been proposed smacks to me of the targets set by the GDR’s planned economy, when decisions were taken at party conferences on how many colour televisions of a particular type would be produced within a certain space of time. Planned economies do not work, as was proven repeatedly during the 20th century, yet the Commission has apparently not yet caught on to this fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">The directive before us is not a million miles away from being the kind of instrument one would expect to find in a planned economy, and this is above all due to the ‘top runner’ approach, the preliminary product checks and the environmental audits. I believe one can regard as only a modest success removal, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, of the provisions in the directive that made it obligatory for environmental audits to be drawn up for the entire life cycle of a product. Differing demands continue to be made of manufacturers and importers, and the resulting problem of market distortions has not yet been resolved either. Although we have made a great deal of progress with this compromise package, the directive is still a bureaucratic nightmare for small businesses. From what I can see, the oft-repeated demand for consideration to be given to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises is being reduced to an empty phrase. It would be the height of absurdity to add to a legislative text an article stating that small businesses must be given help with its implementation, when that text will, in all likelihood, turn out to be unworkable.</p>

Looking at the result, I get the feeling that the Council has got its way on many points. I hope that it will soon come to regret this, for there is a real need for tougher energy-saving measures, in order, for example, to achieve the Kyoto objectives. Yesterday, research in the Netherlands showed that citizens could quite easily save EUR 400 of energy annually, much of which is being used by appliances on stand-by. As the Commission and the manufacturers should give this point the priority it deserves, I would urge the Commission to specify a date by which it will present the first implementing directives to Parliament so that we can get quick results with this directive.</p>

Sustainable development and an ecological modus operandi are a necessary priority for the European Union and are absolutely in keeping with the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="el">Given the difficulty of addressing such issues, which involve numerous commercial and financial activities, I wish to emphasise the following: the self-regulation procedure is a very positive solution for the faster application of the framework for ecodesign and could also help in improving the market response and in adopting legislation for energy-using products which need to be governed by very strict limits, so that companies are obliged, through creative and realistic procedures, to follow and apply it. The derogations for the benefit of Member States on matters relating to environmental aspects, which differ from one country to another, such as danger limits and environmental conduct, are necessary given the dissimilarities and differences in the individual environmental conditions in each country. Note is made of the need to verify products imported from third countries and identifying them will probably be difficult, as will effective verification. It is vital that we have an absolutely independent body of experts for verifying energy-using products and that it be independent of private economic interests. This body could also safeguard confidentiality for reasons of healthy competition, especially with high-technology products with a short commercial life.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, sometimes one cannot but feel sorry for the beautiful city of Lisbon. It has started to symbolise an objective which threatens to slip out of the hands of the Europeans and become a mere illusion. Lisbon does not deserve it, just as Nice does not deserve to be the symbol of a bad compromise. At the moment, however, we have an opportunity to reach towards the strategic objectives of Lisbon. The draft for a directive on energy-using products, now for second reading, is a brilliant example of this opportunity either to promote the achievement of our objectives or to weaken the chances of having them realised.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The greatest worry with respect to energy-using products is the switch of focus of production more and more in the direction of China and elsewhere in Asia. This development, which is unfavourable from the point of view of our industries and environment may even accelerate in the future, due to less demanding environmental and labour protection requirements in Asia. The same trend is very conspicuous in other sectors of our industry, for example in climate policy, where legislative solutions made are leading industry towards less restrictive norms and in this way weakening both the competitiveness of the EU and the state of our environment. It is important that Parliament should approve the report this week which would secure both environmentally-friendly methods of product design and the competitiveness of European business.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The compromise solution now arrived at, and which we are voting on, has been a successful process for the EU institutions, and I have also actively supported the amendments. In this connection I would like to raise the two most important issues. When we talk about competitiveness, it is essential that the legal basis chosen for the directive under discussion is Article 95. The requirements for products must be similar throughout Europe so that energy-using products can move freely within the internal market. Another important decision was made with respect to the conformity verification requirement: it would unnecessarily delay the arrival of products on the market and would be particularly problematic in the electricity and electronic sector.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am pleased that together we have now found a compromise, in which, however, we do not have to make concessions with respect to targets we have set for the next five-year term.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Parliament’s political groups, the shadow rapporteurs in particular, for their excellent levels of cooperation. The directive before us is an historic one: emissions from ships will be cut for the first time. The background to this is Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention, an agreement negotiated within the International Maritime Organisation IMO. This document states that certain sea areas can be defined as sulphur emission control areas. The highest permitted sulphur content in marine fuel in those areas is 1.5%. This is approximately half of the sulphur content of the most commonly used bunker oil currently, in which the average content is 2.7%. The sulphur emission control areas will be established in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel. In addition, the same sulphur limit is laid down for passenger ferries. From the year 2010 onwards a 0.1% fuel sulphur limit is to be introduced for ships at berth in ports.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is indeed high time to limit emissions from ships. Sulphur dioxide causes acid rain and damages both human health and the natural environment. The amount that billows up from solid earth wells has been dramatically reduced. For example in my own country, Finland, these emissions have dropped to a level which is below one seventh of the level in the 80s. On the other hand, ships are belching out more and more sulphur dioxide into the sky. A few years ago the sulphur emissions from ships in the Baltic Sea exceeded total emissions in Sweden.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Despite the restrictions laid down by this directive, the sulphur emissions in EU sea areas will in 10–12 years exceed the total for emissions from all power stations, factories and cars in the EU Member States. Even after the new restrictions, the allowed sulphur content of marine fuel can be as much as 300 times more than that in the fuel tank of an articulated lorry, even where sulphur use is restricted such as the Baltic Sea. The difference is even greater in the Mediterranean and other areas, not covered by the new restriction. Also the sulphur emissions of a cargo ship per tonne of freight are many hundred times greater than with an articulated lorry.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Parliament did indeed want to go further in its first reading and demanded that the 1.5% sulphur limit should be extended to all EU sea areas and later on a further tightening of the limit down to 0.5% should follow. Calculations made by computer models used by the Commission show this to be viable. The extension of the 0.5% marine fuel sulphur content limit to all EU seas would produce human health benefits by, for example, decreasing the incidences of asthma and allergies by at least twofold and possibly even tenfold compared with costs incurred.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Council, however, rejected Parliament’s additional demands at first reading At second reading a clear majority of the Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety nevertheless decided to support the main issues of the first reading. In negotiations with the Council on the compromise reached in the first reading, many Member States announced that they would be prepared to turn down the whole reform. Consequently, the next stages of limiting emissions, as required by Parliament, could not be recorded in the directive itself. Instead, the Commission made a commitment, by a separate declaration, to prepare new and stricter emission limits. The declaration contains a clear reference to tightening the sulphur limit to 0.5% or below and to the use of economic means to manage it. These issues will be debated in connection with the revision of the directive in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It was further recorded in the directive that the Commission and the Council are committed to promote through IMO the establishing of new sulphur emission control areas and making the sulphur limit more stringent. The sulphur limit referred to here is also 0.5%. In other words, we have the Commission’s and the Council’s commitments to tighten the limits of emissions from ships, as required by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In connection with sulphur dioxide emissions we have become accustomed to the issue of acid rain, which is damaging to the natural environment and buildings, but which is also a serious and growing health problem. In the air sulphur dioxide forms particulate matter, which damages our lungs. According to a recent study, the number of people suffering from health problems caused by the particle matter is possibly as much as double previous estimates.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The natural environment is particularly vulnerable in the north, but peoples’ lungs are the same on coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea. We must therefore continue to limit sulphur emissions from ships. I trust that the Commission and the Council will stand by their commitments.</p>

      <p sl="el">Μember of the Commission . Madam President, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Satu Hassi, for her excellent work on the proposal for a directive on the sulphur content of marine fuels. The purpose of the directive is to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and suspended particles. These emissions relate directly to the sulphur content of marine fuels, which are currently 2.7% on average or 27 000 parts per million, at a time when fuels for road transport, as Mrs Hassi said earlier, are subject to a new sulphur limit of 10 parts per million.</p>
      <p sl="el">The proposal therefore sets two limits for sulphur in marine fuels: a limit of 1.5% for all ships in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Channel and for all passenger ships throughout the European Union and a limit of 0.1% for vessels at berth in EU ports. These reductions will result in targeted reductions of emissions at no great cost, in a bid to combat acidification in northern Europe and improve at local level the air quality in all EU ports and coastal areas. The benefits to human health should include 2 000 life years saved every year as a result of improved air quality. As shipping is a global industry, it is important that the main points of the proposal have been brought into line with the internationally agreed regulations in Annex VI to the International Maritime Organisation's MARPOL Convention on the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships. The progress achieved at second reading of this proposal is satisfactory and I thank Parliament for the constructive role which it played in paving the way for agreement.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, amendments to the directive on the sulphur content in fuel used in shipping are necessary in order to reduce the volume of noxious gases emitted from shipping fuels, thereby reducing acid rain and improving air quality in Europe. Making a sufficient quantity of such fuel available would ensure improved air quality in the immediate vicinity of ports and coasts and reduce the harmful effect of acidic emissions on human health. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, for her excellently organised work and discussion on this issue and on the fact that we have reached an agreement which attains the objectives which were put forward. I am grateful to all those who supported our group’s proposal on a review report. Currently many issues are being debated on the basis of presumptions and not facts. Once the appropriate research has been carried out, we will still have to find a further solution which is the most environmentally friendly and most economically justified one – a solution which takes account of precise answers to various important questions. Does the production of reduced sulphur content fuel consume so much energy that it is likely to intensify the greenhouse effect? It is necessary to look at our priorities in strict compliance with the Kyoto protocol, since the adoption of this directive will increase the costs of water transport. Might the increase seriously threaten the cornerstone of the European Union’s transport policy, namely the reduction of transport by land truck and the redirection of the flow of freight towards other forms of transport? We must discuss our future actions also with the International Maritime Organisation, or else we may end up with a situation where changes affect only vessels registered in the European Union and those vessels whose final destination is Europe. Meanwhile, transit transport vessels will be able to use substantially cheaper fuel. In this event our maritime sector would be threatened and we might expect vessels in our fleet to be re-registered under the flags of third countries. The adverse effect of shipping emission gases must be reduced.</p>
      <p sl="lv">I call for serious work to be done on the review procedure so that in the long term we may have a high-performance fleet of vessels and so that appropriate protection may be provided for the European Union’s environment and public health.</p>

Yes, there are some very good things in the compromise, which I welcome – and Mrs Hassi has listed them – but the Socialist Group believes that we still need to go further.

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi for her sterling work on this very important environmental issue. I also share the view that the result would scarcely have been any better if we had forced the matter to a conciliation, something that would of course have been a possibility.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Sulphur emissions from many different sources have, of course, declined considerably in recent years. It has been possible to combat a large proportion of acidification problems in this way. Emissions from shipping are still very high, however, and ships use really dirty fuels not used elsewhere. The proportion of sulphur emissions specifically from shipping is at present indefensibly high. This legislation is therefore very important. The fact is, however, that it could have been significantly better. Resistance from a number of countries in the Council is the main reason why it does not make the most of the technical opportunities we in actual fact have to clean up emissions and fuels.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in Parliament also bear a portion of the responsibility, however. At first reading, the PPE-DE Group was in favour of binding commitments to sulphur content of no more than 0.5%. Now, they have changed their minds, and one wonders why. Now, the objective of 0.5% sulphur content is only included as an option following a future review. That is something we regret. In other areas too, there has been a dismantling of what it would be within our powers to do. In spite of this, we shall vote in favour of this compromise, not because it is perfect but because we believe that it is as much as we can achieve this time.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, you are in any case a good listener. When this issue was discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, it became apparent – to me at any rate – that there are many arguments in favour of reducing the sulphur content in fuels and few against. The introduction of a sulphur limit of 0.5% across the European Union would be 7.5 times more beneficial than the costs involved. That is why I think that the Council could have responded rather more positively to Parliament’s request to restrict the limit to 0.5%.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are awaiting an assessment of Community policy on air quality; it is due shortly. We know that air quality is poor in a number of Member States, which is partly attributable to the emission of harmful substances by traffic not decreasing. Precisely at this time, the Council should have realised that if it considers air pollution to be a serious problem, it should also help find solutions. That is why I regret that the current compromise is all we have achieved. I will give it my support, but I hope it will be tightened up in future, and I would thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, for the unusually good cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, as several previous speakers have pointed out, this is an important issue. Sulphur emissions cause great problems in terms of people’s health. They ruin buildings and the cultural heritage and cause lakes to become acidified. That is why it is also good that we in the EU have succeeded in reducing sulphur emissions, in any case from land sources, in recent years and that we are now moving forward on emissions from marine fuels.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the same time, I, like many others in this House, am disappointed that we have not achieved more, especially regarding those points listed earlier by my colleague in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mrs McAvan. On this issue, we as parliamentarians have shown ourselves to be less green than our predecessors in office. I really do hope that this is an exception and that it will not be the case from now on that this Parliament is less green and takes less responsibility for our future environment.</p>

      <p sl="el">Μember of the Commission . Madam President, the overall compromise package now being proposed includes particularly important points. To be specific, it contains more strongly-worded prospects for further reductions in the future, clarification as to the date of application to the North Sea, preconditions for the supply and distribution of fuels, so that ship operators know their obligations, an exemption from the application of berthing distance limits for vessels which use clean shoreside energy and an obligation for ships which use emission abatement technology to have continuous emission monitoring equipment.</p>
      <p sl="el">Even more important is the compromise package containing the much more strongly worded possibility for lowering limits still further, as far as 0.5% during the Commission review in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="el">Under the amended review clause, the Commission must investigate the economic efficacy of any further measures, take account of the development of emission abatement technologies and study the possibility of submitting proposals on the introduction of financial measures to give industry the incentive to develop new environmental technologies.</p>
      <p sl="el">I know that all these elements were very important to Parliament at first reading and to the competent committee. Although we were not in a position to include the 0.5% limit on sulphur now, as the second stage of the directive, I can assure you that we have undertaken to examine the possibility of setting a limit of 0.5% in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="el">While acknowledging that the new limit of 1.5% for sulphur in marine fuels will remain 1 500 times higher than the sulphur content in fuels for road transport, the Commission firmly believes that shipping can and must reduce this limit, in order to retain its environmental credibility. That is the reason why the Commission has prepared a statement in which it clearly formulates its commitment to conducting a lengthy review of the directive in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="el">To use the specific term in English, which the rapporteur has borrowed from shipping terminology, I wish to emphasise that the Commission will do what it can to anchor environmental improvements to shipping in the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, the Commission is most satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations and wants to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, once again for her efforts to broker an agreement at second reading. The Commission can accept all the proposed compromise amendments .</p>
