      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking you all for giving me the opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the Commission on the European scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I would like to emphasise the importance of this programme for the most deprived citizens of Europe. I can mention two figures here. Each year more than 18 million people receive more than 440 000 tonnes of food distributed under this programme. Over the years this programme has become one of the main sources of supply to charities working in the field of food aid. More than half the products distributed by the members of the European Federation of Food Banks in 2010 originated from this programme. So it is really important.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last April the general Court set aside the provisions of the 2009 plan for products purchased in the market. Specifically, the Court ruled that the Commission cannot define the volume of the programme independently of the volume of existing stocks. The total volume of the plan must also be adapted to the volume of the existing stocks when the plan is drawn up. The proportion of products purchased in the market in relation to the total volume of the plan must reflect their exceptional nature.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the Court’s judgment and given the limited volume of intervention stocks available, the 2012 plan had to be greatly reduced. The Commission has recently adopted the 2012 plan in order to give the participating Member States and charities time to find additional resources to replace the volume that will not be provided at European level. As regards the future, the Commission made various initial proposals in 2008, followed by an amended proposal in September 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">The express aim of these proposals was to make the scheme sustainable as intervention stocks become increasingly scarce. This subject was thoroughly discussed in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this Parliament and in the plenary on the basis of the report prepared by Mr Siekierksi. The Commission has always appreciated the clear stance of Parliament on this matter. However, a sufficient majority has not yet been obtained in the Council. But the Commission is firmly committed to the continuation of the scheme in the future and is ready to make any adjustments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this background, in its recently released communication for a multiannual budget for the period 2014-2020, the Commission has proposed a budget of EUR 2.8 billion at current prices. Considering the important contribution that the programme makes to meeting the poverty reduction target of the Europe 2020 strategy, it will in future be financed from the budget for social policies. The necessary legal proposals will come in due course. In the meantime, the Commission recalls that an agreement on the basis of its 2010 proposal is needed with a view to securing a food distribution plan in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that this package will help an agreement between the Council and Parliament to be reached, so as to ensure legal certainty and stable financing for the scheme. For this compromise we need strong support from this body.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am outraged by the recent Court of Justice rulings on the food distribution scheme for our most deprived citizens. The European Parliament has shown just how much we have all been united and scandalised by this ruling, which is a purely legal decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact is that 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty. Now, in 2011, we are questioning the future of the food distribution scheme for our most deprived citizens for the next two years: 2012 and 2013. This aid benefits Europeans. Many of our fellow citizens in the 27 Member States need this aid to survive. The decision was also taken during a crisis. Taking the two factors together, it is clear that we are heading for massive problems that will hit our most deprived citizens the hardest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the rapporteur on the European Social Fund (ESF) for the 27 Member States, Parliament has naturally fought to provide aid for the least well-off through social policies. This could certainly work as a short-term solution to bridge the gap, but is not a viable permanent solution, because we need social policies that allow the unemployed, those who have no jobs, to return to the labour market. That is the purpose of the ESF.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me stress that we remain fully committed to preventing aid policies from eating into social policies, even as all our efforts need to be focused on this aid for our most deprived citizens. Consequently Parliament will work tirelessly to ensure that the ESF and that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which also helps workers in difficulties, are maintained. However, we will also continue to work on combating poverty and devising workable food aid schemes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore calling on the Council to accept its responsibilities and support these social policies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the European scheme for food distribution to the most deprived people in the EU was established to facilitate the excellent distribution networks operated by food banks and Restos du coeur soup kitchens – the brainchild of the French comedian Coluche in response to a distressing situation – we were in the middle of a harsh winter, the winter of 1986-87. Will the coming winter, in the midst of a prolonged crisis, be any less harsh? I suspect not. Why, then, should we abandon this programme? Why should we take an axe to it, as the Commission has just done in the 2012 budget that it has presented? We are going over the same ground as when we negotiated on the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We were told that combating poverty was the responsibility of Member States – an issue covered by subsidiarity and therefore outside the European Union’s competences. Ultimately, we decided otherwise. Once again, we are being told that this policy area can only be dealt with at Member State level. That is not on. Solidarity has to be a European principle, otherwise the essence of solidarity will be lost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This programme is also now a victim of the success of the agricultural policy, which has reduced stocks and banned the creation of any new stocks. Surely this should raise some questions? Ultimately, some people appear to have forgotten about Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which states that combating social exclusion should be at the heart of all European Union policies: in the policies themselves, the resources deployed and action taken. What happened to that overarching European Union approach? Commissioner, we are calling on you to reinstate the budgetary resources for the food distribution scheme for our most deprived citizens. We are calling on you to give a clear undertaking that the financial perspective will not cut off a single cent from this service for our most deprived citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, as my fellow Members have already pointed out, hot on the heels of the Year for Combating Poverty, and as the number of poor in Europe continues to grow, the European aid scheme for our most deprived citizens – a vital part of food aid in Europe – is now directly in the line of fire. The amount of aid is going to be cut by 80% in 2012 and there are no guarantees at all for 2013. Therefore, you urgently need to come up with a practical solution for the millions of beneficiaries. For starters, the Commission needs to establish a transitional solution forthwith that will guarantee the programme’s existence for the next two years and maintain the food aid currently provided to our most deprived citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Looking ahead, you need to understand that Parliament demands, expects and hopes that the Commission will establish a permanent facility dedicated to ensuring sustainable European food security with an annual budget of around EUR 500 million – although that figure will have to allow for changes in food prices. To do that, you will need to mobilise the requisite budgetary resources. That is what we in this House expect from you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the long term, we need to agree to restrict speculation on commodities so as to create more control over food prices. Obviously, European farmers of the future will need to be able to make a living from what they produce. Consumers should no longer have to live with constant price rises, and our most deprived citizens must have enough to eat. European solidarity is needed more than ever before.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore our duty and your duty to make this aid permanent, given that millions of individuals depend on it. It is incumbent upon us and upon you to combat poverty and exclusion in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I first of all say this has been, and probably will continue to be, an extremely important scheme. I think it has helped many people throughout Europe on many occasions; but just because something has been achieved in one way in the past does not mean you cannot change it for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the CAP has a responsibility to produce the food. That does not necessarily mean they are the right people to distribute that aid. I think that is the question that has to be answered here. We live in a time when everybody talks about the same thing: food security, food security, food security. When I came to this Parliament we had beef mountains, butter mountains, milk lakes – this is all gone. There is no food security anymore. Now we have the challenge of ensuring that we are able to feed the world, able to feed the people of Europe. I think that is the challenge that is before us. That is what the CAP has got to do. Food waste is a terrible thing, and I think we can do an awful lot to bring it under control.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, 13 million impoverished people depend on the European food programme. The European Union itself has created this dependence, and that includes Germany and all those other Member States that now suddenly want to put an end to this programme. It is inhumane to now allow those 13 million people to go hungry. An urgent solution needs to be found to this urgent problem.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the longer term, we hope that food aid will no longer be necessary in Europe. It is clearly a scandal that more than 40 million people have too little to eat on a continent that is as rich as ours. I expect the Commission and the Member States to do everything in their power to ensure that poverty has been cut by 25% by 2020, as we have promised. Even then, it will be another 40 years before poverty is completely banished from Europe, and people will need food aid for all that time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Over the last two years I have visited food banks throughout Europe, from France to Serbia and from Iceland to Slovakia. Some food banks are completely independent of the European programme, others absolutely not, but all of them could use some help. For many of them it is not food that is really the problem – they get that from supermarkets, farmers and businesses – the main way that we can help is with money and with expertise in relation to logistics, transport and storage.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For the new budget period, we need to look into how we can best use European resources in order to help as many people in poverty as possible. Until then, there needs to be a proper transitional period during which we all take responsibility for the 13 million ultra-vulnerable Europeans who rely on us.</p>

Bairro" p_group="Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left - Vice" m_state="PT">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, it is regrettable that we have come to this situation of suspending or drastically reducing a food aid scheme at one of the worst moments of economic and social crisis in several EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The decision of the European Court of Justice, acting on a complaint made by Germany, to reduce funding from EUR 500 million in 2011 to only EUR 113 million in the following years, especially in the year following the European Year for Combating Poverty, contradicts all the official declarations of the European Union concerning its commitment to this struggle and its own goals of combating poverty and social exclusion. It is scandalous that food aid is being reduced by 80%, since 13 million people here in the European Union currently benefit from it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We in Parliament have stressed on many occasions the fundamental nature of the right to food and the need to improve access for all, at all times, to the nourishment necessary for an active, healthy life. Because of this, we advocate the continuation of this support, bearing in mind that more than 80 million people in the European Union are at risk of poverty. In 2010 we adopted a report advocating the introduction of a guaranteed minimum income in all Member States on the basis of at least 60% of the national median income in each country.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On that basis, we insist that the Commission and the Council immediately find a way of continuing the programme and the scheme for food distribution to those people most in need, based on the EUR 500 million, and also that they subsequently present a proposal and a timetable for the implementation of the minimum income scheme.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in the European Union we talk a great deal about freedom, democracy and human rights. We boast of our achievements and of spreading these values. Yet what is poverty, and what causes it? In the vast majority of cases, poverty is caused by a lack of work or other reasons that those hit by poverty cannot do anything about. How can we accept that 40 million people in Europe live in poverty, and that a further 40 million are living on the poverty line? Does such a situation not mean that human rights and freedoms are being restricted? Is this what democracy means? We are currently experiencing a crisis, unemployment rates are rising, and what is the Commission doing? It is placing restrictions on funding for the distribution of free food to poor people. We should maintain the current funding of EUR 500 million per year earmarked for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I cannot agree with the view that the ruling handed down by the European Court of Justice means that Regulation (EC) No 983/2008 can no longer be used as a legal basis for the programme. It should be noted that this ruling merely annulled Article 2 of the Regulation, which relates to additional purchases of food on the market. The Regulation thus remains in force, and can provide a legal basis for the programme. In my opinion, we should not create a new programme; we must merely modify the existing programme, in order to increase the amount of food at its disposal. At the same time, in recent years the European Union has been spending enormous amounts on limiting production. How is this possible, what purpose does it serve?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Commission’s decision to cut the funding for this food distribution programme so drastically does need to be challenged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why did the Commission not appeal against the Court of Justice ruling? Why did it not immediately propose an alternative? How is it that a legal basis can be found for EUR 113 million in funding, but not for EUR 500 million?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, this programme is needed, because not all Europeans have enough to eat. As you reminded us, the scheme benefits 18 million people. The Europe 2020 strategy aims to move 20 million people out of poverty. Food poverty is one factor.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As part of the report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, both in my draft report and in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, our response to this decision was to call for both short-term and medium-term initiatives to ensure that our most deprived citizens are not forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We urgently need to come up with some solutions that address both social and agricultural issues linked to the problem. This must not be done at the expense of the budget for other social policies. This situation, which no one here wanted and which no one can accept, requires everyone to take rapid action, and we need massive support for this resolution, which will be put to the vote at midday.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I think that we could contemplate changes to the budget line. We are not asking for conservatism, but we are asking for two things from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is a recognition that the growing inequalities in Europe are probably the greatest threat to European integration since the Union was created. When I say the growing inequalities, I mean the fact that people are working their fingers to the bone and are unable to feed their children while others are apparently paid seven-figure bonuses. That is both a reality and how people perceive reality: this is what they hear every evening on the television. You can run as many information campaigns as you like, but if we fail to halt these growing inequalities, this project could go very wrong.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I would like the Commission to be consistent. The fact that combating poverty and exclusion is one of the five key Europe 2020 strategy targets is a real achievement. Put simply, then, we are asking for a little consistency with regard to that target. You need to know that this House will back you if any Member States object.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, yesterday, when we were debating the priorities of the Polish Presidency of the European Union, we heard a great deal about the fact that the European Union Member States are the happiest places on earth, and that many people from outside Europe are attempting to gain entry to them. However, these happy places are also home to people – and quite a lot of them – who are suffering deprivation, who are living in poverty and who frequently cannot afford to buy food. It may be that the number of people living in poverty continues to increase, because the global food situation is changing, we are seeing more and more food shortages, the price of food is rising and more and more people will not be able to afford to buy it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The food aid which has been provided by the EU to date is therefore particularly important, and one of the best of our joint endeavours. This aid should continue to be provided. EUR 500 million per annum is the equivalent of an annual contribution for such aid of one euro per EU citizen. Legal problems should be no obstacle. They should be resolved as quickly as possible, and the conditions should be put in place to ensure that this aid continues to be provided, at least at the current level, since there really are a great many people who need and expect this aid.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, this is a genuine scandal, a denial of justice. Although Europe has been providing support for our most deprived citizens since 1987 by distributing food, without which many families would be unable to eat on some days, some Member States have disputed the mechanism, because in Europe, unfortunately, we are only able to make savings at the expense of the weak. So we are now heading straight for a food crisis for over 20 million Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From a figure of EUR 500 million in 2011, the food distribution scheme will be cut to EUR 113 million in 2012. In the midst of the crisis, when the rich are getting even richer, when large corporate groups are inundating their shareholders with dividend payments, Europe will be sending a shocking message to the victims of the crisis. Those who are hungry do not care about stupid quarrels. Parliament has a duty to restore Europe’s political honour by somehow reversing this scandalous decision.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, the ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union has dealt a severe blow to the European scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">This ruling reduces the money to be used for purchasing the food to be distributed next year by social organisations from EUR 500 million to just EUR 113 million.</p>
      <p sl="es">Solidarity with the most needy people and combating social exclusion are the foundations of the Union and the Europe 2020 strategy.Therefore, at a time of economic crisis like now and taking into account our own commitments, this scheme becomes even more essential.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, we have all gathered this morning to express our anger. There may be legal reasons for the decision that has been taken, but it makes no political sense. Indeed, it is politically indefensible, in the current crisis and under the current conditions, to reduce the food aid budget as you are proposing to do – aid that goes to our most deprived citizens. You cannot leave it there. You cannot. All the political groups in Parliament are calling on you to make the right decisions. We are not talking about EUR 500 million as opposed to EUR 100 million. We are talking about at least maintaining existing levels of food aid. Demand is growing in every country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me say a few words on the subject of agriculture. Once again, my comments are directed at the Commission. The question of agricultural stocks is not the same as it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago, when intervention stocks left us with huge surpluses. In the current European situation, we need a policy on food security stocks, both for Europe and for the rest of the world. I say this in the light of starvation levels around the world and the current situation in Europe. These are two very clear signals. You must reinstate a decent budget that will allow us to address this problem. In terms of agricultural policy, the Commission now needs to put forward clear proposals that will allow the creation of what we are calling food security stocks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The reality is that access to food is a major problem at the dawn of the 21st century, both in Europe and in the rest of the world. This morning, this House is sending you a very clear message. I hope that you are up to this massive challenge.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, hidden behind the widespread prosperity of our continent is an often invisible Europe that we refer to in numerical, statistical and sociological terms and not as real people. These people are often women and children or the elderly – the most vulnerable population groups in other words.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, Europe will have no credibility in the eyes of the public unless it learns to be consistent, and we want to be consistent, in this Parliament and at this stage in Europe’s existence. Therefore, if we say that the Union is based upon values and human rights, I do not think we can suspend or cut so drastically a programme for people who suffer from food poverty – in other words, for those who lack the right to food or the right to access food and hence lack fundamental rights – on account of an unresolved legal issue. We are talking about an agricultural fund, a social fund – and if it is a social fund, Commissioner, it should not impinge on other social programmes, but be a new ad hoc fund with appropriate resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">We say that we want to guarantee food security for Europeans, but the most important right with regard to food security is the right to food itself, followed by the right to healthy food. We need, therefore, to be consistent. With that in mind, we must find a legal solution that provides continuity and that, with the help of non-governmental organisations in the voluntary sector, guarantees the most fundamental human right: the right to food.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the scheme for the most deprived persons is one of the European programmes best known and appreciated by European Union citizens as it supports the provision of food to particularly vulnerable individuals or families who are experiencing hardship. There are 43 million people across the European Union who cannot afford to eat a full meal once every two days, and this number has grown as a result of the economic and financial crisis. In 2009, 18 million citizens in 19 Member States benefited from receiving 440 000 tonnes of food. We support the continuation of the scheme and a return to the annual budget of EUR 500 million. I think that we urgently need to find sources for funding the scheme in 2011-2013 and, subsequently, to devise a sustainable solution, including in legal terms, for the 2014-2020 period. The UN report on the food crisis compels us to take immediate, responsible action.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, poverty is a political, economic and social problem that needs far more than superficial relief for human suffering. That is why we consider that there are two particularly important points in the problem at issue.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, that the current economic crisis in numerous Member States of the European Union will exacerbate living conditions, especially for a young, very large section of the population and that this needs to be addressed in a viable and cohesive manner.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, a bureaucratic monetary approach cannot overcome the essence, both political and humanistic, of such an issue, especially in the current environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to point out, in light of the hypocrisy with which we have become accustomed to address issues as a whole, that, according to our habits, it would appear that each and every inhabitant of EU27 can still throw away 179 kilograms of food, which of course may be edible for those who can barely scrape by.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the decision in spring by the Court of Justice of the European Union prohibits intervention stocks as being contrary to the Regulation on the organisation of agricultural markets. The Court’s decision takes the view that volumes of products distributed under the Food Aid Programme must be adapted to volumes of intervention stocks.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In many countries, EU food aid is distributed via communities and aid agencies, which is to say, on a voluntary basis. The dramatic reduction in the product range under the Food Aid Programme may endanger the entire food distribution scheme. The voluntary networks will break up, and food aid donated from elsewhere, shops, for example, might not be distributed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The decision by the Court of Justice is grotesque, when one considers that last year was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and this year is the European Year of Volunteering. Are these European Years just for speeches in honour of special occasions? What does the Commission intend to do to put this right?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the attitude of the European Commission is deplorable in that it has not appealed against the Court of Justice ruling and has effectively endorsed swingeing cuts to the budget for our most deprived citizens amounting to nearly EUR 400 million. However, I was delighted to hear what Mr Barroso had to say when he addressed Parliament on Tuesday, which was along the same lines as the motion for a resolution that has just been tabled by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the debate on the multiannual financial framework, Mr Barroso reminded us just how much the most deprived European citizens need our help in order to survive. He therefore called for the food distribution scheme for the most deprived to be renewed for the 2014-2020 period, but also promised to urge the Council to finally take a position on the draft regulation that was first tabled in 2008 and, as a matter of urgency, to continue the scheme in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me, then, pick up on those proposals and ask the Council – although it will not be able to reply today – why it can give no justification for keeping this dossier on the back burner for three years. The ball is now clearly in the Council’s court: the Council needs to find a solution for 2012.</p>

It would be absurd – and indeed it already is – if the EU were able to save certain banks which do engage in these sorts of speculation and investment activities, and yet we were unable to assist banks that are specifically designed to help the 13 million people living on a day-to-day basis.

      <p sl="sk">Even so, experience shows that the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union still has a relevant role to play. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that nearly 13 million people in the Union rely on this scheme. This hardly shows our work in a good light. I agree with those fellow Members who say that the food distribution scheme should not become entrenched in EU policy and that we should instead be aiming to integrate the socially excluded into mainstream employment schemes and social protection systems.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the current situation, however, it would probably be imprudent to scale down the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union without introducing an adequate replacement.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a very difficult decision awaits us. Firstly, we have established an excellent aid chain. It starts with the European Commission transferring money, and then non-governmental organisations supply basic products to the most deprived persons. These basic products include porridge, rice, flour, and sometimes tinned foods, milk and butter. I do not understand how we can now deprive many people in difficult situations of this basic assistance. I have met these people on many occasions, and they were enormously grateful. Not only on my own behalf, but also on behalf of the Federation of Polish Food Banks and the people who benefit from this aid, I am calling on the Commission today to retract this ill-advised and harmful decision.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, although we have in Europe the highest standards of living in the world, there are millions of people who are unable to provide the necessary food for themselves. Reducing the total funds available for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the European Union will deprive many people of a basic right – the right to food. The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union must be backed up by finding solutions for continuing the scheme on a permanent basis in the medium and long term, which will be appropriate to the legal situation. The common agricultural policy is a social policy where not only farmers must be represented, but also all European citizens as taxpayers. This is why support for people in need is a responsibility which must demonstrate unity in diversity at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I very much appreciate this lively discussion. The message of all the speakers to the Commission is very clear. The Commission has to keep it in mind and I hope also the other institutions will do the same. All European institutions will have to make joint efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">I share your concerns about these people, the most deprived people, and I can also accept what we have said: that a European idea is not only about principles and values; it also has to do with implementation and results. So after 2010, the Year of Poverty, we have to face the situation, and we cannot be happy about the results on our continent. We have to fight poverty in a real and very inclusive way.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let me be clear about the future, the Commission now has to assess the situation following the decision of the Court. We have to assess the situation, not in a legalistic way, and we have to respect the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind you of the decision of the Court: the Court ruled that the volume covered by the plan had to be adapted to the volume of existing stocks. I would also like mention that the wording of the judgment and its grounds left very little room for any change to this position. That is why the Commission did not appeal. This is the reason.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what can we do now? We have two problems to face: how to find a permanent solution and an interim solution, as you have very clearly pointed out. What I can say on the interim solution is that the Commission proposal for 2010, if adopted, can provide the sum of up to EUR 500 million for 2013. We have to work on the basis of your proposals and we are trying to take on board your suggestions about the next two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the long-term solution, we have decided to fund this programme through social funding. I can understand your concerns. We all have to work together in order to have this funding. But this should not be to the detriment of other purposes; this is also important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to inform you that the Commission has proposed EUR 2.8 billion for the social programme for the years 2014 to 2020. We really need to implement our 2020 strategy, which includes the goal of poverty reduction. So this is the situation and we are going to do our best and keep in mind all of your suggestions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me close with a small reference to my portfolio, I am the Commissioner for Fisheries. In the framework of the reform for the fisheries policy – which I will propose to the Commission next week – we also will create a facility for fish food. We are going to stop discarding, and distribute the fish and the food that would have been discarded in these programmes. So we can all work together to do our best.</p>

      <p sl="ga">It is clear from the figures of the European Programme for the most Deprived People that the programme is extremely important for the 43 million people in the EU at risk of food poverty. The programme provides food assistance in 19 Member States to 13 million people living in poverty, and there are 240 banks and charities involved.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Given that one of the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy is the reduction of poverty in the EU, there must be strong support for this scheme, especially since the economic crisis is increasing the pressure already being felt by the most vulnerable in the EU. European farmers produce high quality food, and in my opinion it is of significant advantage to the EU that the common agricultural policy (CAP) is able to make wholesome food available to those in the EU who are experiencing social and economic difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="ga">While many people question this social role of the CAP and the EU, I believe that the EU has an obligation to develop all aspects of policies such as the CAP in order to help those who do not have many advantages.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first I will summarise the principal parts of the reform package that was agreed so strongly at the committee stage. We want to bring forward a polling day from June to May to allow for the more speedy election of the Commission. We are going to create a modern supranational regime for privileges and immunities. We will initiate a dialogue with the Council on the reapportionment of seats, according, I hope, to a mathematical formula that we will need to agree on. We invite the Commission to come forward with new proposals to facilitate the participation of citizens, wherever they may live, in elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">The key proposal, and the one that has created a degree of controversy, is to have 25 Members of Parliament for a pan-European constituency, elected from transnational lists drawn up by the European political parties. The purpose of this is to transform the European elections by giving the political parties a central role in campaigning by dramatising and personalising the European dimension of the campaign. It is certainly possible that Mr Barroso’s successor as President of the Commission could be found on a transnational list.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time has come to galvanise European political parties. This is a time when many, perhaps most, national parties are neither willing nor able to sustain European integration in a democratic and efficient manner. People tell me that this is not the time for such a radical proposal. Well, when it is ever a good time to do anything in politics?</p>
      <p sl="en">When the popular legitimacy of the Parliament is in doubt is a good time to act. When we are installing an economic governance is a good time to give European democracy a greater profile and a boost. Frankly I doubt whether the demonstrators in Syntagma Square would complain at being offered the choice to vote for two political lists: the national and the European.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some people are also concerned about the necessary change to primary law. But the fact is that small Treaty changes are needed to bring in the Croatian Members and to rectify the situation where the present composition is in breach of the Treaty principle of digressive proportionality.</p>
      <p sl="en">One other complaint, if I might. A criticism that this will create two classes of Member: super ‘Eurostar’ MEPs and other, inferior Members elected from national lists. But the Treaty says we are representatives of the Union’s citizens and we need to provide that essential degree of electoral reform to transpose the Lisbon Treaty in line with political and democratic reality.</p>

    <intervention id="4-048-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me start with a quote: ‘looking ahead, the Commission confirms that the Union would greatly benefit if a number of Members of the European Parliament were elected from European lists submitted to the whole of the European electorate.’</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an extract, not from the report presented to you today by your rapporteur, Andrew Duff, but actually from a communication forwarded by the Commission to the Convention in 2002. So the Commission remains convinced that European lists could help to enhance the transnational dimension of European elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let me say a few words about Mr Duff’s report. First, I note the tremendous personal efforts of the rapporteur – and I would like to thank him – to seek wide support in the Parliament on such a complex and sensitive issue. The core of the report concerns the creation of a pan-European constituency to which 25 MEPs would be elected. I know some Members of this Assembly are against such lists, but I think it is an idea worth pursuing.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will, however, not be easy to implement and here begin the concerns of the Commission. First, I am not sure our fellow citizens will understand the need to increase the number of seats. This was the conclusion of the Convention: above 750 Members an Assembly may find it difficult to function.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, increasing the total number of MEPs requires a Treaty change, unless the 25 MEPs elected on transnational lists would be part of the existing number. In the Commission’s opinion, this procedural difference is very significant. I understand your rapporteur has already tabled amendments to leave the door open.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, it was so difficult to reach a compromise on the allocation of seats between the Member States that it hardly seems conceivable to reopen such a debate right now. But such a discussion would be essential, should the 25 MEPs be part of the whole number here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, the principal elements of the proposed reform would need to be ratified in all Member States. In some countries this could even mean a referendum. Are we ready to run the risk of a ‘no’ vote now? In the present climate of both institutional fatigue and economic austerity, any referendum would be risky, and the national parliamentary ratification processes cannot be taken for granted either.</p>
      <p sl="en">In any case, the Treaty requires the European Council to adopt by unanimity a decision on a proposal from this Parliament so your Assembly – this is a clear message – has the right of initiative on this matter. There is no formal role for the Commission. I trust you will present your proposal in time for the European Council to decide early enough before the spring-2014 elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, the report brings forward the idea of creating an electoral authority to conduct and to verify the results of this election. It also provides for the creation of an electoral role to prevent double voting.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both instruments would indeed seem necessary and would be put in place after the revised electoral act has been ratified. The Commission will need some time to draft a proposal on this. It will also likely take considerable time for Member States to agree so this would be only possible for the 2019 elections at the earliest.</p>
      <p sl="en">This brings me to a specific request addressed to the Commission to present a new proposal for the revision of the current information exchange system to encourage participation of EU citizens in European elections in the Member State where they reside. The Commission has already made such a commitment but the proposal has been blocked in the Council since 2006 because Member States cannot find the unanimity required to adopt this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another demand addressed to the Commission concerns statistics and your wish to improve the consistency and comparability of population data provided by Member States. On this point, I can announce that Commission services are currently working on a draft proposal which should be coming soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many other points in the report. Be sure that the Commission can only subscribe to principles such as the better representation of women and minority candidates or the respect of democratic rules in the selection of candidates. The Commission also supports the idea of having the elections in May rather than in June.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this report concerns constitutional issues rather than simply legislation. The Commission is already ready to make some amendments in the procedure for the 2014 elections. I mentioned earlier the way forward with Directive 93/109/EC, taking into account the outcome of our debate today, to encourage people to stand and to prevent double voting based on the current ex-ante checks.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards statistics, the Commission is already preparing the proposal to improve the consistency and comparability of population data. Finally, three months ago, Vice-President Šefčovič promised you that he would examine your request to establish a specific European legal status for political parties at European level. The Commission is presently looking into the key elements in the Giannakou report with an open mind, and it may indeed come back to you in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for the very clear exposition of the Commission’s position. My particular thanks also to Andrew Duff, as cooperation on this report has been excellent.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the proposals in the report on direct elections to the European Parliament has turned out to be unusually challenging. There is considerable opposition to the idea of a pan-European list which would represent the European interest and strengthen the European identity. My position is that this controversy deserves further exploration. After all, there is generally a parliamentary majority that supports the broad project of European integration, yet the pan-European list, which is certainly about just such integration, is proving unacceptable to many.</p>
      <p sl="en">My sense of it is that opposition to the list derives primarily from those who place the short term before the long term. It is true that in the short term Europe faces an economic crisis of far-reaching proportions, the future of the euro is far from assured and instruments to resolve the crisis are still being elaborated. Those who focus on the short term will say that this is no time to be experimenting with a pan-European list – yet. In reality the case for the opposite position is stronger. Whatever form the resolution of the crisis will take, it will demand more European integration, not less.</p>
      <p sl="en">That will unquestionably mean more transfers of competences and powers to the European Union. The power flows so transferred will require representation – that is the heart of democracy – and will demand that representation at European level. This is precisely what the pan-European list wants to achieve: to represent Europe and to represent the citizens of Europe, which is why concentrating on the short term is short-sighted and futile.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament believes that the construction of a true European political space is a prerequisite for progressing towards a political Europe that can rise to this century’s huge challenges in a strong, determined and appropriate way.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Treaty of Lisbon represents a significant step forward in this respect, especially when it comes to the principle already mentioned by the rapporteur, Mr Duff, which clarifies that the European Parliament directly represents European citizens at EU level. Nevertheless, despite this and other important innovations in the Treaty of Lisbon, and despite the fact that everyday life clearly shows us that a political Europe is necessary, the construction of a true European political space is still a long way off.</p>
      <p sl="it">Debate in our Member States is too focused on national issues, too many of the discussions among political parties are carried out from an exclusively national perspective, and the European elections themselves often appear to the citizens as an extension of national political debate, which is also one of the reasons for the overly low turnout.</p>
      <p sl="it">We believe that a reform of European electoral law that strengthens our common principles can contribute towards this Europeanisation of European political debate. Clearly, it is not the only requirement, but it can help. Therefore, despite being aware of the numerous problems associated with this proposal, the S&amp;D Group supported the proposal for a transnational list in committee.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time we supported the request for a referral back to committee, because we realise that broad consensus is needed on this proposal. However, we also believe that we must proceed with determination towards a reform of the European electoral system that strengthens the transnational nature of these elections.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Duff, first and foremost, on behalf of our group I would like to thank you most sincerely for the many years of work that you have put into this project and for the energy and enthusiasm with which you are trying to persuade us to support it. We all know that we will have to get to this stage at some point. You, yourself, asked earlier on whether now is the right time. I think that, first of all, we really must adopt a report in September. We all know that it will still probably take years, perhaps even decades, until this is actually implemented. However, if we do not start now, we might not even succeed in putting it in place in the next few decades, either.</p>
      <p sl="de">Personally, I would like to still be around to see us become a real Parliament with a single transnational list, because even the German Federal Constitutional Court has called for this and observed that we will only have true legitimacy if we are able to be elected by any citizen of the Union. However, in order to still reach a compromise, I would recommend that – in order to accommodate the small States – we extend the group of people who are allowed to stand as candidates on the transnational list slightly, perhaps to 10%. Our group Chair, Mr Verhofstadt, mentioned this somewhat light-heartedly in his speech yesterday.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the central proposal of the Duff report is the creation of an extra 25 MEPs to be elected by the whole of Europe. I believe that creating a new constituency, covering the whole of the EU, is democratically flawed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask Mr Duff, to whom will these 25 new MEPs be accountable? Certainly not the people. These new MEPS will be accountable only to the European political party that placed them on the list. They will speak on the party’s behalf and answer only to the party hierarchy, not the people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Far from bringing Europe closer to its citizens, this proposal will further increase the divide between the ordinary citizen and the politics in Brussels and Strasbourg. An additional 25 MEPs, representing the whole of the EU, will also be expensive, both in money terms and in carbon dioxide consumed.</p>
      <p sl="en">At a time when the EU is seeking to reduce its carbon footprint, do we really need another 25 pan-European MEPs travelling across the whole of their new huge constituency? This proposal also places an extra burden on taxpayers. At a time of austerity, how do we justify spending millions more euros on extra politicians and their staff?</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Duff also wants a new electoral authority to oversee the election of these new MEPs and an electoral roll for the whole of Europe. Have these proposals been costed? Of course they have not. Conduct of elections must remain under the control of nation states.</p>
      <p sl="en">The only beneficiaries of these proposals are the European political parties. Indeed, I would argue that Mr Duff wants to create these new MEPs and an election, simply to give them something to do. The Duff report is undemocratic and expensive. It erodes the sovereignty of the nation-states and my group will oppose it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Fox, I concur with virtually everything you said, but would you also agree with me that the Commission’s mentioning there could be some form of European office to coordinate these elections and a single electoral role for the whole of the European Union is obviously a dangerous move towards a federal European state?

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe needs innovative ideas in order to move forward, as well as ideas for how we can gradually achieve a European democracy and a democratic Europe, because citizens’ influence on European politics is still too small. We need real European debates on European issues. Citizens must have the option of having the last word. The citizen is king. We therefore need a European right of initiative and, in my opinion, we also need European referendums. We need a reform of the electoral system. European elections are still purely national affairs – they are run by national parties, with national candidates and fought mostly on the basis of purely national issues. Incidentally, I regard this to be largely a misuse of European elections. We must ensure that the elections and also the issues are European in nature.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Duff’s proposal is one such innovative idea, as it will have a direct and an indirect effect. One indirect effect is that it will force the parties to take a European stand, to debate European issues and programmes and to nominate European candidates. Another effect is that, in addition to the national candidates, citizens will also find European candidates on their voting slips. This proposal relates to the key concern of the European Union and our work here.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, I am also grateful for this fierce debate, because who are we representing here? Are we just a Union of Member States and do we just represent the interests of the citizens of our own countries? Or do we also represent a common European interest? Are we representatives of the citizens of the European Union? The truth is we are both of these things. We must not lose sight of either one of them. That means – and that applies just as much to our citizens – that there are national aspects to an election, but there are also European aspects. I look forward to the day when, in addition to their voting card containing the national candidates, citizens will also have a second voting card containing European candidates.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, we Greens have set the benchmark in this regard. The Greens are so far the only party to have gone into an election campaign with a European lead candidate and a European programme. I believe that we owe that not only to the idea of Europe, but also to the reality of Europe. Thus, if, one day, voters from the United Kingdom vote for French candidates and vice versa because they think they are good candidates, then Europe will have taken a step forward.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, what is democracy? Is it the right to vote every five years? No, it is not. In a true democracy, the election is merely a parenthetical event in the democratic process, which takes place in between the elections. The question is, therefore, whether the proposal to place 25 MEPs on European lists will strengthen democracy between the elections. Will it reduce the distance between the voters and those they vote for? I believe that this group will be even more disconnected from voters. At the same time, the proposal will result in more MEPs for the large countries. If you want to have a lot of votes for people on a European list, you would obviously not nominate a lead candidate from Finland or Malta. On the contrary, you would nominate candidates from Germany, France and the United Kingdom. In short, the proposal would result in less diversity, less accountability and less democracy. I would like to thank Mr Duff for his sterling work, but I cannot support the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, while the Duff report acknowledges and faces the fact that to the majority of European citizens the institutions of the European Union – including the European Parliament – are uninteresting and obscure, it increases the chaos instead of providing a solution. It deals with election systems, mathematics and internal bargaining barely understandable to the average person.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The point is that these European parties, running under various names and consuming a vast proportion of Parliament’s budget – yet essentially all globalist, neoliberal and intent on eliminating nation states – have suddenly started a fervent reformation of their election laws to prevent patriotic and anti-centralist forces from being able to run, or to make sure that they run only with great difficulty in the 2014 European Parliamentary elections. The biggest flaw of the report is that, while leaving the current system, which does not even guarantee the proportionate representation of individual states, unchanged, it expands it with a transnational list. This means that average citizens – who are voting in increasingly smaller numbers during successive election cycles because they barely understand or see the value of the European Parliament and barely follow its activities – can also vote for an international list, the so-called European Parties. Ladies and gentlemen, do you really believe that in 2014 German, UK or Hungarian voters will vote for a Spanish, French or Finnish individual about whom they know next to nothing and who is unaware of their problems? Do you believe that it is possible to personally campaign in 27 countries with close to 500 million Europeans? It is almost certain that people will be more confused than ever, and even more citizens will avoid European elections like the plague.</p>

      <p sl="es">The debate taking place today is likely to focus on the pan-European list, and I say pan-European because my group has tabled an amendment along these lines that we will uphold, with all the more reason today, in honour of the recently deceased Archduke Otto von Habsburg, who used the term ‘Pan-Europe’.</p>
      <p sl="es">The pan-European list appears to raise serious doubts. Some people are telling us, ‘It is too soon.’ However, I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that on 8 May 1950, an advisor told Chancellor Adenauer or Mr Schuman, ‘Minister, Chancellor, it is too early to make a Franco-German agreement to pool coal and steel.’</p>
      <p sl="es">For conservatives, everything is always too soon. For those who want nothing to change, it is always too soon.

      <p sl="es">The transnational, pan-European list fits into this idea of dreams, ideals, poetry and struggle.

      <p sl="sk">Last but not least, elections to the European Parliament should be more straightforward, easy to understand and appealing to citizens of Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Duff. Unfortunately, though, I have to say that I do not support this proposal, except inasmuch as there are good arguments for bringing the election date forward to May.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There are three main reasons why I do not support the idea of having 25 new Members of the European Parliament. First of all, they are simply not needed: this Parliament is already big enough. We should, instead, think about how we can improve the work we do and make it more effective. Secondly, this will be a coup for the big Member States. Thirdly, there are practical problems. A crucial part of the work of a parliamentarian is to keep in touch with the people. Apparently, these 25 new Members of Parliament are not expected to keep in touch with the people and the electorate, because that will be impossible in practice. If the EU expands, how will it be possible to visit each Member State even a couple of times a year?</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I would like to say that, of course, EU matters could be dealt with in the elections differently, and I want to remind everyone that in the last parliamentary elections in Finland – the national elections – nobody spoke of anything else but European matters. National issues took second place. It depends on us ourselves what issues we put forward as priorities.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, my fellow Member and friend, Mr Méndez de Vigo, if I may say that, for he is certainly my friend and I have a great affinity for his country, lives in the mountains. A large number of the 500 million voters in the European Union live in the valleys, and voter turnout continually drops year after year. I think that this is a major problem for the European Union, since the European Parliament is the only institution which is elected directly by the citizens. The legitimacy conferred upon this Chamber by the citizens in these elections is decreasing year after year.</p>
      <p sl="cs">When I read about the individual measures, I have the sense that precisely this essence, in other words the citizen within the framework of the European Union, will be lost. Measures are proposed here in Parliament, and yet no one asks the citizens what they themselves want from the EU. A proposal has been engineered concerning the creation of a single, EU-wide electoral district, the MEPs from which will be even more remote from their citizens than the MEPs elected in the Member States today.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Let us therefore attempt instead to get closer to the citizens, let us not dream up plans for EU-wide electoral districts, let us strengthen direct democracy and let us rather allow the citizens themselves to decide more often. Let us consider how we can make it possible for them to take part in elections, for example by means of the Internet.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the aims behind the proposed reform are all worth supporting. I support all the aims mentioned in this debate by those who are in favour of this reform.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Nevertheless, I am sceptical about transnational lists. From the perspective of a citizen of a small Member State, the reform looks like greater influence on the part of the big Member States. If transnational lists are open – if voters can freely elect someone on them – in practice, only candidates from the largest Member States will be elected.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If, moreover, the European parties put up candidates in order, once again the Members from the biggest Member States in each party will have the greatest influence, and this will repeat itself from party to party. It is very important to find ways to engage in European political and public debate, but I earnestly hope that we will find better remedies than transnational lists, which, at least in my country, will only serve to increase opposition to the EU.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in light of the scope to act that we are afforded as Parliament, we really have to ask, ladies and gentlemen, whether we, too, have sufficient legitimacy for our actions here. Mr Duff’s report – and I very much welcome the many years of work that he has carried out – puts forward specific proposals for strengthening the European element. Some of these will clearly not receive majority support, but he is taking the right approach and it deserves broad support and a public debate, including outside this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our group, too, there were heated debates about the specific proposals in the report. This reflects the divergent interests in, and experience with, the European Union. On one point there is agreement. Parliament is not the only place for discussing and taking decisions concerning democracy. Therefore, I give my clear support to the approach taken in the report, which I believe is the right one, and to the report’s call, right from the outset, to go well beyond the negotiating mandate towards the Council. Citizens must be given their own voice in this process and the European political parties must be active in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report is aimed at reforming European electoral law, moving us towards the creation of a European federal state.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are plans to add a transnational college, elected using the proportional method and regulated by an appropriate EU electoral authority. We are very much opposed to this choice: firstly, it does not respect the political groups that have their roots in their own countries rather than at European level, and secondly, huge costs would be incurred in setting it up. What is more, we would have two different types of MEP, because it would be unthinkable for MEPs who have to travel round 27 and subsequently 28 Member States to be treated in the same way as the others – what funds would they have to be able to look after their own region?</p>
      <p sl="it">Another point that we oppose is the creation of an EU electoral roll, because its management in terms of the deletions, insertions, amendments and checks required for hundreds of millions of voters would incur unnecessary additional costs for the EU budget. The creation of a single European political space would limit the Member States’ sovereignty.</p>
      <p sl="it">We believe in a Europe of the peoples that respects the situation in the regions and represents and empowers them, not a Europe that imposes itself as a bureaucratic ‘superstate’ and master.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, never mind the quality, feel the width. This proposal will not add anything to the quality of European democracy. You are just kidding yourselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will further remove the citizens from its politicians. Everything about this proposal is wrong. There is a suggestion of gender and ethnic-based quotas. Quotas are wrong. Positive discrimination is wrong – it creates victims. Has Mr Duff even considered the cost of implementing this proposal? I suspect not. Apparently the taxpayer has deep pockets. This proposal is open to abuse. One British party, UKIP, is currently boasting that it can take cash for a pan-European party to spend on its own domestic agenda.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the people are the foundation of democracy. ‘People’ means identity, a combination of history, traditions and ideals, but it also means unity and the desire to have a single government.</p>
      <p sl="it">On that basis, a single electoral system is clearly an instrument for building a population, a European demos . This European demos still does not fully exist, as demonstrated by the fact that in the last European elections there was a much lower turnout and hence a lack of responsiveness, and by the fact that national debates have focused primarily on national problems and not on European problems.</p>
      <p sl="it">The proposals made in the Treaty of Lisbon should therefore be implemented. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament is not obliged to present or draft a uniform electoral law; the Treaty merely indicates that it has the power to do so, but it is an extraordinarily important power, and therefore we must not abandon our plan to undertake this reform of the 1976 Act.</p>
      <p sl="it">We will refer this document by Mr Duff – whom I thank once again in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – back to committee. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted his text almost unanimously, and we are somewhat reluctant today to see it be referred back to committee. However, precisely because we must not back down in any way, I believe that Parliament should redraft the text so that it is more workable and can receive broader support, but that referral back to committee should not be a way of shelving the reform.</p>
      <p sl="it">The need for a European vision is not due solely to the fact that elections could be held in a transnational college; there is also the question of what the direct election by the people of the Members of the Commission or at least of the Commission President would involve. It is with that question that I shall therefore conclude my speech, extending my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mr Duff.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, there are two proposals in Mr Duff’s report that I think we should bear in mind straight away. These are moving the polling day to a time in the year when the political temperature is higher. Such a small change could in fact help to increase turnout in a number of Member States. It is also extremely important for us to do something with regard to the issue of parental insurance. Men are the norm even in this Parliament, and that should not be the case.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Otherwise, I agree with many of the views expressed by Commissioner Damanaki. However, I would explain it in a way that is a little clearer. There is too much of a ‘helicopter perspective’ in this proposal and too little long-term pragmatism. Together with our European and national parties, we need to show what decisions the EU is actually taking that affect the lives of EU citizens in a positive way, particularly in areas where national power is inadequate. How could a nation, a Member State, regulate the financial market on its own? How could an individual Member State do anything with regard to climate policy? We must get better at long-term pragmatism and stop coming up with such wild proposals as those tabled by Mr Duff. Realism is important.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this modification of the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament we have an opportunity to uphold two principles, namely the transnational list, so that we have something more than an embryo at last, and a genuine step in the direction of European federalism, and we in the Italia dei valori party welcome the rapporteur’s tenacity in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, it is a mistake to think that the transnational list alone will reawaken the interest of the citizens, half of whom already fail to vote in European elections. We need innovative quality indicators that are in touch with society. We in the Italia dei valori party have proposed in committee to set a ceiling on MEPs’ mandates, in order to change those in office and create a process of renewal. This amendment was rejected – on rather ridiculous grounds, in my view – by MEPs instinctively seeking to protect themselves and their position.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are committed to making other changes for the next part-session: the first change concerns the regional dimension of elected representatives and constitutions – of MEPs – to ensure that they have a strong relationship with their home region, and the second change will be made both through the amendment tabled jointly with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – and I am grateful to Mr Gualtieri – and with a separate text aimed at ensuring a ‘clean Parliament’, as requested by the public.</p>
      <p sl="it">A ‘clean Parliament’ that prevents people who have received definitive sentences – and thus obtained all the guarantees of a fair trial – for extremely serious offences such as terrorism, corruption, organised crime, incitement to racial hatred, and so on from standing in elections. It is a disgrace that those guilty of such crimes should be able to sit in this House today. More courage is needed, ladies and gentlemen, and it is only with pioneering European rules that the European Parliament will obtain all the credibility it deserves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this really is a triumph of bad timing and insensitivity. At a time when European citizens are questioning in ever increasing numbers the effectiveness, relevance and, above all, the cost of the European Union, we are bringing forward proposals for an expensive extra level of pseudo-democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strongly oppose such a proposal and see it as a perfect example of the increasing disconnect between some Members of this House and their electorate. Before Members vote for more MEPs, perhaps they should study the trends in opinion polls across Europe. These show rapidly declining support for the European project, and most particularly for this Parliament. If we want to reverse this trend we must find ways of reflecting the views of the citizens, challenging the Commission to bring forward relevant initiatives and demonstrating added value to Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not the case that we Conservatives do not have dreams. We do. We dream of a progressive Europe. It is just that those dreams lead us in a completely different direction.

      <p sl="sk">While Mr Duff’s report has raised a number of acceptable proposals for change, the proposal for an additional 25 MEPs elected by a single constituency formed of the whole territory of the EU is out of step with those pragmatic changes. I agree with Mr Duff that the body of the European Parliament could be split into two separate chambers. The Union’s Chamber of Citizens, created under current rules, would be based in Brussels and would carry out those duties currently performed by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Chamber of State Representatives, which would have not 25, but x-times as many representatives as there are EU States, for example three times 27 seats in the current situation, would be headquartered in Strasbourg and would be responsible for conciliation and coordination in disputes between the European Union’s highest-level institutions. The Chamber of State Representatives could also reduce the electoral weight of small States in the majority decision-making of the Chamber of Union Citizens. Such a change could prove beneficial.</p>

Consistency and Lib-Dem policy, as demonstrated in tuition fees and now this, remain alien to each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">On his website, Mr Duff states that, so far, national politicians have been rather bad at connecting citizens with the EU. The irony in this statement is that, if Mr Duff asked the electorate of the UK whether they wanted more MPs elected on a pan-European basis, they would say ‘no’.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no connection with the EU, because the EU is like a parallel universe. While national governments cut public spending, the EU demands more. When business asks for less red tape, the EU adds more. It is for reasons such as this that there is no connection and no affinity with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until the EU actually recognises that government for government’s sake is a bad thing, and that better government comes from national parliaments, the electorate will remain detached from the EU. Twenty-five pan-Euro-MPs will only cause further disenchantment, cost more money and become completely removed from a constituency base.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is an ambitious proposal and one which we should support in principle. There are some elements in it which are not controversial, because we are all focusing only on the transnational list. I think we can all agree that streamlining the electoral procedure is not controversial.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are some proposals in it which have produced controversy, most notably the transnational list. I think that this is an experiment in transnational democracy. Regardless of whether one is a true federalist or, more modestly, believes in creating a European public space, I think that we should support it.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we want the European political parties to be visible and citizens to take a well-informed choice – because decisions in this House are taken by political parties – and if we are really interested in how effectively our postulates are being realised, we should know what these parties do. If we want a European election campaign to be based on a truly European debate about European issues, I think that we should, in principle, support this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one caveat. I support it if the transnational list is open, giving citizens a true choice and stimulating political parties to present the best candidates. Here I am sometimes amazed when people from smaller countries say that it would actually benefit only big countries. This means that you have no faith in your parties to actually put forward good people. I will just give you one example. If the Czechs were to put forward Vaclav Havel, I am absolutely certain that many people would want to vote for him – people who actually have similar ideas to mine. But if they were to put forward Vaclav Klaus, I am pretty sure that, maybe, many conservatives would want to vote for him as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some problems. There are people who are not ready to embrace this idea, and it is true that having more MEPs at a time of financial austerity would send the wrong signals. But this is not Andrew Duff just being capricious. We are obliged by the Treaty to take it up. We have to take the initiative: this is the only part of EU law where we have the initiative. It is too serious to be dropped, so let us talk about it a little more, because this proposal is really worthwhile.</p>

The next step is indeed this strategic instrument of European lists alongside the national lists.</p>
      <p sl="de">Democracy involves discourse and deliberation, as Professor Habermas used to say. That is exactly our problem. The political class has a national system of discourse. The debates remain in the national realm. We have no overarching European debate, no European political realm, and the European lists would force the political class to come together and to think in European terms, to argue from a European point of view and also to make the alternatives clear to citizens with regard to the forms of Europe they have to choose from in the elections. I hope that we will succeed in implementing these European lists with your report, Mr Duff. We need this vision, and we should not give in.

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner, I like your proposal, Mr Duff. I think that this is a stimulating, future-oriented and visionary report, but one that could perhaps soon become reality. Creating a transnational list would emphasise the European aspect of the election. It would give a much-needed boost to the more often than not tired national election campaigns. It would, in my opinion, strengthen democracy. I completely agree with the view expressed by the fellow Member who has just left. I would happily vote for Václav Havel. I cannot understand why those of you who come from small countries have such poor self-confidence. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is President of the Party of European Socialists. He is from the little country of Denmark. Pat Cox came from the little country of Ireland and he was President of this Parliament. He did not even have a party behind him. You need a little more self-confidence, ladies and gentlemen. Europe’s voters are clever, informed people and I believe that they can differentiate between national elections and European elections, and they would see it as an opportunity to go out and vote twice and to also be able to elect their European politicians. Voters will also be able to ensure that the politicians do their job – they need not be re-elected next time. This report is good, necessary and visionary. To Mrs Ulvskog I would just like to say that we can certainly be realists, but sometimes we also need to be bold and dare to think outside the box. Unfortunately, I thought you sounded rather conservative, Mrs Ulvskog. My thanks to Mr Duff.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the right to European citizenship must be safeguarded by the proper implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, a task entrusted primarily to the representatives of the EU citizens elected in the territory of the Member States, with the aim of asserting a genuine right to European citizenship as a basic prerogative of every citizen who identifies with Europe’s values.</p>
      <p sl="it">The postponement of the vote on the report, which was intended to modify the provisions on the election of the Members of the European Parliament, takes nothing away from the excellent work done by the rapporteur and the committee. Rather, it is evidence of careful consideration because, while the creation of a transnational list accomplishes the task of guaranteeing a single form of representation, the need to ensure that the elected political ruling class genuinely represents the individual regions is clearer than ever today.</p>
      <p sl="it">The United States of Europe depends above all on the common application of the values of solidarity and integration for the benefit of the entire Community, in particular the outermost and island regions, which are more exposed than ever today to the growing pressure of illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced that the rapporteur and the committee will work hard to make changes that embrace the sentimental view of a Europe that is genuinely united, not least by a single electoral constituency, yet based on the need for those who are elected to represent their region. For one thing is certain: citizens today genuinely want to identify with Europe. This is on condition that the European Union recognises the size and the needs of the regions, because it must start there in order to come up with an organisational model that genuinely responds to citizens’ needs.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, our first task is to make European Union citizens interested in European issues. Over the years numerous important steps have been taken to improve various election systems, and therefore an additional list of elections to the European Parliament will hopefully help our citizens to become more actively involved in the election process. However, the European Parliament itself has not yet fulfilled all its obligations, laid down in the Treaties of Paris and Rome. I am talking about the harmonisation of election procedures in the Member States and the right of individual candidates to stand for office, as well as other problematic issues. I believe that we should also take into account the shortcomings of the current system mentioned by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which are preventing the European Parliament from fully implementing the principles of democracy and are failing to encourage our citizens to become actively involved in elections, because they are simply disappointed by the slow pace of reform.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Mr Duff, for your courage and enthusiasm in putting on our agenda the item on the reform for changing the electoral system. As we are examining today a very important supranational European topic, I will speak not in my mother tongue, Bulgarian, but in the language of one of the Member States which has always been a driving force for European integration and has been an example to many young European democracies in Eastern Europe – Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the report, particularly the proposal to elect 25 MEPs from a transnational European list. However, the devil is, of course, in the detail. Is it possible to organise something like this? Can we convince voters that this is the right thing to do? Is now the right time to do this? Most importantly, are we really convinced that it is right to do this, or are we simply looking for reasons to block it?</p>
      <p sl="de">This tangible idea comes at a difficult time. Europe is at a crossroads, and we need to ask ourselves whether we need to continue to deepen European integration, leave it at the current level of development or even accept renationalisation. The Polish Prime Minister gave a very optimistic and Europe-centred speech yesterday, the core element of which was the vision of more Europe as the answer to the crisis. The Duff report contains exactly that and it is a tangible element of this vision.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, the transnational European lists will be a strong signal that the federal project is an attractive prospect for our continent. If we reject the report, we will, in my opinion, be giving in to the unfounded fear that our citizens at home do not understand us, and we will be surrendering in the face of national populism.</p>
      <p sl="de">It may be that the proposal is not the perfect solution for many of us, but let us continue to work on this proposal, towards the formulation of more objectives with the help of the European parties, towards more European representation and away from national egotism. This step is necessary in order to encourage a European debate and a European identity, to give Europe a face and to give European issues more weight in the European elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament is currently made up of 27 national representations. The transnational list will create a genuine European representation and I would be very much in favour of us adopting that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Duff has presented us with a visionary and – as he said himself – radical proposal for the reform of the electoral system. I believe that that is a good thing; we need proposals and we need more Europe in European politics.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the reality currently looks rather different: 18 fellow Members are still waiting to be able to come here to Parliament and we are already talking about expanding Parliament by another 25 Members. I think it is good that this report, most of which I support, will be debated once again in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that we will then adopt this Duff report here with a broad majority the third time around, because we need a uniform electoral system. I would like to share many of Mr Duff’s visions with him. Hopefully, we will adopt the final report in the second half of this year and then also implement it. However, I believe that we need a broad majority, not just a slight majority, because then we will really make ourselves heard with this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have all experienced, during campaigns for election to the European Parliament, how locally concentrated the discussion is in our constituencies. Discussions cover not only national issues, but often even local issues. We all experience, in our everyday activity in our constituencies, how weak or non-existent the perception is of our European parties and of our political families, of the differences between us and even of our main issues as parties. We all also know, Madam Commissioner, that participation in the elections – not only in European elections but also national and local elections – is falling in Europe. It is a big problem and a big issue, but as a solution to that we cannot propose less Europe, but more Europe. We need to reinforce the discussion on European issues and on European political systems, and to involve our citizens in this, which is what the proposal by Andrew Duff is about.</p>
      <p sl="en">Andrew Duff is calling for real input to ensure more Europe. Strangely enough, listening yesterday to the speech by the Polish Prime Minister, I had the impression that he, representing the Council – i.e. the intergovernmental institution – is more Community-oriented and often has more of a Community spirit than this House, which should represent the Community spirit in Europe. Let us think of this when we discuss the proposal by Andrew Duff, which I support very strongly and with full conviction.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should say that I, too, am in favour of a strong Europe, a visible Europe, a citizens’ Europe. I am in favour of a federal Europe. I am in favour of implementing any and all measures that will make Europe more successful and more ambitious.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I struggle to explain to my fellow citizens, the citizens in my country, why Europe is currently focused on institutional issues, when those citizens feel that they have been left by the wayside.</p>
      <p sl="fr">They ask me ‘Surely other things need to be done first? What about the Greek crisis, the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, manufacturing issues, global warming? What about the 13 million people, Europe’s poorest citizens, who are looking for solutions to their own difficulties?’ I do not know how to tell the people I meet that institutional problems are my immediate priority in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore support this approach: I am a firm advocate of a federal Europe. The pan-European list undoubtedly sends a very clear message in favour of the strong Europe that we want. Mr Méndez de Vigo, you said that we must act now, but I am not sure, at present, how to explain to my constituents that we need to start by looking at our institutions when they feel that we have abandoned them by the wayside.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this debate is characterised by the discussion of a visionary idea. Unfortunately, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s tasks go well beyond the role of the creative department of the European Union. We are also called on to tackle tough jobs. Unfortunately, we are falling short of this goal with this report. Paragraph 1 of the conclusion states that we want to ensure that there is a fairer distribution of seats. A newly elected European Parliament will meet in three years’ time from next Monday. We have 40% of the parliamentary term behind us and, therefore, paragraph 1 is inadequate. We need to do our homework in this regard. We need reliable criteria for the composition of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I acknowledge that smaller Member States need to be accentuated for the sake of their identity. However, if we already have a situation in which some Members here represent 80 000 citizens and others 800 000 and the votes cast by citizens in elections carry different weights, then we need to provide clear justification for why this is the case. We used to talk about a democratic deficit because Parliament had no voice. Today, we permit a situation to exist where in Karlsruhe it is said that we have a democratic deficit because we have no recognisable ratio in the composition of Parliament. That is precisely what we need. Therefore, we have not done enough in my opinion. We need something that is beyond all doubt and also something that we can carry into the future, irrespective of how population figures change. Then we will not need to have a democratic deficit again in the future, Mr Duff. You have presented a very complicated formula. It is important that we do not have a democratic deficit in the sense that 75% of teachers can explain the composition of the European Parliament to 75% of pupils.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I believe the election of 25 additional members of the European Parliament beyond the ceiling of 751 seats will upset the degressively proportional representation of the citizens of individual Member States enshrined in the Treaty on European Union, as there is a risk that celebrities, singers of various kinds and instant politicians could run as MEPs in at least a third of Member States, regardless of the number set for each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In specific cases, they would most likely be well-known personalities from the large Member States which are already at the helm of the European Union. The awareness in small countries of political and other high-profile personalities from the large Member States is obviously incomparably higher than the other way round, namely the general awareness in larger countries of well-known figures from smaller States. This is simply the way things are. I have nearly finished, Madam President. Smaller States would again be marginalised. It is my view that past elections to the European Parliament have fully and legitimately represented the citizens of all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, it is more than 30 years since we had the first direct elections for Members of the European Parliament, and I welcome Mr Duff’s report. However, I do not support the notion of transnational lists as this would therefore create two categories of MEPs: some who are elected in national constituencies and the others who ought to be elected based on an EU-level constituency. I wanted to emphasise this point because it is important that MEPs are equal and that, therefore, they can represent the citizens of Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, we have to remember what the role of a Member of the European Parliament is. We represent our Member States and those who voted for us.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is absolutely clear to me that it would not be a development in the right direction if we established this two–tier model, with a small, elitist group here that is elected without any obvious electorate or constituencies, or whose constituency is the whole of Europe. This would only serve to increase the democratic deficit even more, and, if I may say so, it is very hard to justify these types of changes.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The role of a Member of the European Parliament is to build a Europe of citizens, and to ensure that those values that lie at the heart of Europe – democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion – can be strengthened. That happens best by having a system of proportional representation and a clear relationship with our electorate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For that reason, I myself oppose this kind of idea. I do not think that the time is right for this reform: we should instead be finding more tools to enable the public and decision–makers to come into contact and keep in touch with one another far more often.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am very pleased that this proposal by Mr Duff is finally on the table, because it genuinely represents a step in the direction of a common European political system. All of us are elected at national level. That means that, in our home countries, we are primarily asked about what is important from a national perspective and not what is important from a European perspective. For us to actually have 25 MEPs who are elected at European level in addition to the other Members makes perfect sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am in favour of the idea of doing this within the framework of the 751 MEPs and also – as has already been suggested by Mr Häfner – not at the expense of the small Member States. I come from a small Member State myself and I am not concerned that we will lose out here, because we could say that with 751 MEPs, the number of MEPs will stay the same for each Member State (Austria will soon have 19), and these MEPs will be elected either from the national or the European list.</p>
      <p sl="de">To Mrs Tiçau I would say: there are constituencies at national and regional level in our home countries, too. Why not also for Europe? To Mr Wieland I would say: you mentioned a complicated formula, but that is no longer in the report. I hope that we will indeed take a step towards more Europe – with regard to the elections, too.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, this report is clearly divorced from the reality of the European Union and the situation we are currently experiencing. For this reason we do not support it. For a start, we disagree with the proposal of having 25 additional Members who would be elected by a single constituency made up of the entire territory of the European Union. That would especially favour the larger countries, ignoring the fact that there are currently 27 Member States, whose people have the right to elect as Members people whom they know and who are in regular contact with them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, it is inadmissible that, once again, an attack be made on the right to representation of the smaller and medium-sized Member States, reducing their chance of direct representation, which will end up further distancing elected representatives from the ordinary voters, weakening democracy and contributing to an increase in abstention in European elections.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, what will basically happen when this supranational constituency is created? I do not doubt Mr Duff’s good intentions, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The concrete result will be the creation of a supranational political European oligarchy. The reason for this is that the leaders of the large parties will guarantee their election for life in the European Parliament via this supranational list. The cost to European voters will be an extra EUR 100 million for each single parliamentary term.</p>
      <p sl="bg">As regards gender equality and electing more national minorities to the European Parliament, I would like to address all my fellow Members and say that here we have as many men and women as voters in the EU countries have decided to send here.

Therefore, we need to be a little more patient. One day, we will have a federal Europe, but at present there is no political majority. Let us not infuriate our citizens with measures of this kind.

A trans-European constituency covering 27 countries is not a self-identifying whole. The rapporteur clearly believes that it might lead to the development of such an identity, but that identity is a prerequisite for, and not a consequence of, an electoral process.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are faced with a report whose content is unacceptable. We hope that the postponement of the vote on it and its referral back to committee means that the ideas it contains will not prosper, even though it is well known that many proposals with equally anti-democratic content that do not achieve the necessary consensus at first manage to get through later. There are numerous examples of this in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The principle of equality between sovereign states is being more and more neglected, while instead the idea of a superstate is being encouraged and strengthened, whereby power is concentrated in a directorate of powerful countries, which ensure that decisions are made essentially in accordance with their own interests. The other states are relegated to an increasingly ancillary role and to a position of obvious subordination to the decisions made by the ‘control centre’. Now that this path has been cleared by successive Treaty revisions, and especially by the Treaty of Lisbon, an attempt is now being made to go further along it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur’s proposal for the distribution of seats in Parliament takes a further two seats away from Portugal, while leaving the joint weight of the six largest countries untouched, although these are already in a majority in comparison to the other 21, as together they make up 56% of parliamentary representation. However, this inequality would also certainly be substantially worsened if the proposed additional single European constituency were introduced.</p>

      <p sl="fr">None of Mr Duff’s report, whether it be changes to election dates, the desire for the European Parliament to establish its own national composition, the imposition of quotas for ethnic minorities or other groups, the pointless ‘EU-wide list’, the desire to harmonise EU Member States’ minimum ages for voting and for eligibility to stand as a candidate, or the imposition on Member States of how their electoral districts should be established, is acceptable. Common minimum standards are of course possible as a way of ensuring better representation; I am thinking here of national constituencies, proportional representation, a 3% threshold for the distribution of seats, and so on. Parliament’s national composition must come under the authority of the European Council and maintain equivalent levels of representation between countries of a similar size, and must not be strictly proportional to Member States’ populations. However, above all, whether you like it or not, Members of the ‘European’ Parliament, as they are so called, remain representatives of their country and their country’s people. Also, whether you like it or not, as the French historian and philosopher Marcel Gauchet, who cannot be accused of ‘populism’, rightly said, ‘the national context remains the true political context in which people assert their belonging and their desire to influence a common future’. If citizens are turning their backs on you, it is because you are refusing to accept the inevitably national nature of democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would like to take the opportunity of the debate on the own-initiative report proposing a modification of the Act of 1976 concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, to call to mind that the Treaty of Lisbon empowered the European Parliament to propose changes to its composition and its election method. The flagship proposal of Mr Duff’s report is of course the creation of EU-wide lists. The idea being put forward is to enable each elector to cast one vote for the EU-wide list in addition to their vote for the national or regional list submitted under their Member State. I personally support this idea of EU-wide lists, as I believe it is likely to give a pan-EU dimension to European election campaigns, which we bemoan for too often focusing only on national issues. The EU-wide list could also contribute to the development of European public opinion and genuinely European debate. Moreover, the existence of EU-wide lists would give European political parties a more important role, as they would benefit from greater visibility in the political landscape and could lead common campaigns in all of the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We are always saying that MEPs need to be close to voters in order to know their opinions and be aware of their needs. Despite this, we now want to foist a representative on them who will not have time to visit their country during the parliamentary term and who will never understand their problems, except, perhaps, through an interpreter. Suddenly someone has an idea, and the next thing you know they make it item 2b and propose that ‘in addition, 25 other representatives shall be elected in a single constituency comprising the entire territory of the Union.’ If we stand by what is written about proportionality in the EU Treaty, we should not introduce requirements which have no basis in the political system and which violate the principle of proportionality. I do not want to make changes in order to accommodate candidates who failed to make it onto their party’s list in the elections, or who, not having been accepted by the people in their own country, are looking for a way to circumvent Article 14(2) of the EU Treaty. It is inconceivable that citizens would vote for someone who is neither known to them nor even from their own country.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have to say first of all that it is a disappointment that there has not been time for a full debate in plenary of this important matter. It has widespread support from all political groups, and I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">When many of us set out in the 1990s to bring an end to the use of anti-personnel landmines, we were conscious of the fact that thousands of lives were being lost through them every year and that the lives of thousands more victims were blighted by injury. Our armed forces had agreed that anti-personnel landmines were no longer an essential element in their armouries.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was an enormous international mobilisation of political will and the resources of governments and NGOs to overcome a scourge that not only costs lives but obstructed development in so many of the poorest countries recovering from armed conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of us who contributed to the Ottawa Declaration and were involved in the sponsorship of the original ‘mine actions’ entertained the hope that this great problem could be overcome in a finite period. We have to ask why this has not been the case – although there has been enormous progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourteen years on, more than 90 countries are still afflicted by anti-personnel landmines and other explosive remnants of war to some degree. Still there are casualties, and still huge resources are being spent on mine action. We therefore thought it appropriate to draw attention once more to the issue, particularly since the European Union institutions are heavily involved in mine action. I pay tribute to the role of the Commission in this, being one of the leading contributors – along with many Member States, the United States, Canada and others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our focus throughout the report has been on anti-personnel landmines, while recognising that explosive remnants of war may include cluster munitions as well as other munitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In drawing up the report I was very conscious that the Western democracies are on the side of the angels. We try to help. Our motives are good, and nothing is served by unnecessary self-flagellation: the research underpinning the report reflects this. Instead we highlight those governments – Burma and Libya, for example – that have recently laid anti-personnel landmines, and insurgent groups such as the FARC, which are continuing to produce their own devices, and other terrorists and insurgents that have made increasing use of improvised explosive devices, which are a threat not just to our armed forces on operations but to the local civilian population as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our attention therefore needs to focus on those whose actions continue to impact on innocent civilians going about their everyday lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consulted widely in this report. We held a seminar in January, which was attended by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the Geneva Centre for International Humanitarian Demining, the International Committee for the Red Cross, the Slovenian-based International Trust Fund for Demining, HALO Trust and the External Action Service, and we have also had written contributions from many others.</p>
      <p sl="en">One outcome of the seminar was unanimous agreement that the Commission should revert to a single budget line for mine action. But given the difficulties that we are facing today – the economic difficulties in so many of our countries – a key message of the report is for a more focused approach to mine action, prioritising those states which are most in need of help while encouraging afflicted states that can afford it to commit more of their own resources to combating the scourge of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many countries, such as Angola, rely too heavily on international financial assistance and could make a greater national contribution themselves, and there are other states, such as Bosnia, where conflict is over but where there is a massive residue of explosive remnants that is holding back economic progress. Such countries should make greater use of their own armed forces for mine action, training units specifically for humanitarian demining tasks.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I reiterate our belief that, through better international coordination and prioritisation, improved management, survey and demining practices, better reporting and more astute and better use of funds, a world free of the anti-personnel landmine threat to life, livelihood and economic development is a realistic possibility within a finite period.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I think that Mr Van Orden’s report reignites the debate about one of the security risks which still affects Europe. Anti-personnel landmines have been used extensively in conflicts such as the Balkans war, and continue to cause civilian casualties. Mine clearance in former conflict zones is an expensive and lengthy operation. Not all the countries affected have the funds required to carry out this activity. This is why it is difficult for the inhabitants to return to their homes and there is the risk of accidents occurring. I think that better coordination among the international donors would provide legal support for the gradual clearance of mines in conflict zones. It is also important to involve the local authorities in this action as they will benefit from it. In this context, I also urge specialist NGOs to focus their efforts and put an end to this problem.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is delighted that, 12 years after the Ottawa Convention, a significant reduction has been recorded in the number of victims of anti-personnel mines. We are proud of the fact that the European Parliament was at the vanguard and continues to lead international efforts towards a world with no mines. However, there is still work to be done and thousands of people are still suffering the consequences of these weapons.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the report we are debating today, we are trying to see how we can optimise our international action, so as to obtain even better results in the future. It is time for us to review the overall picture and to find an anti-mine strategy which is as comprehensive, cohesive and focused on the interests of the populations involved as possible.</p>
      <p sl="el">Consequently, our international and local action should not only cover anti-personnel mines; it should also cover other remnants of war, such as cluster munitions. Even greater emphasis needs to be placed on educating and informing the potential victims, most of whom are unsuspecting children.</p>
      <p sl="el">My especial thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, for the exceptional report which he has presented and for his cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs during the drafting of this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as one of the shadow rapporteurs, I would also like to thank Mr Van Orden for this very good cooperation and the very good report that has come out. You have included and tried to include most of our amendments, so I think we have a very good report here. I am also very sorry we do not have a wider debate on it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to draw attention to one issue that came up after we had the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which is why the topic is not included here. In May, a coalition of several NGOs, including IKV Pax Christi, published a report, which I would like to show you, on worldwide investments in cluster munitions; that is a shared responsibility. It talks about the companies – be it banks, insurance companies or others – who continue to finance the production of landmines and cluster mines; that is an encouragement. This is something that we criticise in our report and which has to be stopped. I would like to call on the Member States, the Commission and Council and national parliaments to support these NGOs’ initiative and ensure that there will be no more financial investment in the production of these cruel arms.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, 100 million anti-personnel mines are buried in the ground throughout the world, and 70% of the victims are typically civilians. Thus, the Ottawa Convention was a step in the right direction. However, in the EU we should also take a look at our Member States. For example, 66 years after the Second World War there are around 700 undetonated bombs in the ground in my home town of Linz. The search and recovery result in costs in the region of EUR 200 000 that have to be paid by the landowners.</p>
      <p sl="de">The way that my question to the Commission of 13 January 2011 in this regard was dealt with was more than a little non-committal, with reference being made to framework directives for guarding against dangers at work and for protection at work as well as for the removal of shipwrecks and bridge rubble. If this was a school assignment, I would say that it had completely missed the point. Thus, we unfortunately have to conclude that there is quite clearly a lack of awareness in the EU of the problem with regard to the removal of relics of the Second World War from central European cities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, our colleague Mr Van Orden has produced a timely and excellent report, well prepared by a panel of experts. Progress has been great in the meantime, but it has been uneven. The report points to some big countries which have not yet joined the mine-ban treaty, like Russia, which was removed from the list of users only last year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The existence of huge stockpiles in some countries is also problematic. For example, China and Russia respectively have 124 million anti-personnel mines in storage.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also the problem of clearance of mines, with the report pointing out that some countries are overly reliant on international assistance. It is, above all, up to the countries concerned to take responsibility for the clearance of mines. The last message from this report is assistance for the victims. It is a long-term challenge and it needs a strong sense of international solidarity. EU money must also be provided.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we welcome the ‘Progress on Mine Action’ report by Mr Van Orden. We agree that considerable progress has been made on this issue but that there remains, however, much to do, particularly with regard to the most vulnerable countries, which continue to need international support, and in the field of victim assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s goal is to see the complete eradication of anti-personnel mines, whilst addressing related economic and social problems. The report correctly points out that, while the number of new mine victims is decreasing, there is still a need for assistance to victims. Significant humanitarian and development challenges therefore remain. The report rightly points to the huge effort already made by the international community. As part of this effort, the EU and Member States have collectively provided political, financial and scientific support to mine action worldwide. Financial support amounted to nearly EUR 1.8 billion in the last ten years. This constitutes around half of the world’s financial assistance to mine action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our support has taken many forms. Firstly, through common foreign policy joint actions we have provided support to mine clearance, we have promoted implementation of the landmark Ottawa Convention, we have enhanced our efforts to secure greater adherence to the Convention, and we are also now preparing a new Council Decision after the Second Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention held in Cartagena, Colombia in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, through the provision of development assistance, the Union budget has contributed around EUR 400 million for the period 2002-2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we agree that it will be necessary to review the Guidelines on European Community Action. These aim to ensure the mainstreaming of mine action in national development programmes and to promote links between security and these programmes. This approach requires beneficiary countries to prioritise mine action in their programmes, as called for in the report. We also agreed to focus on developing greater local capacity and that future assistance should be earmarked for those countries least able to help themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to assure all the Members of Parliament that certain mine action activities have been funded under the crisis response provisions of the Instrument for Stability. Humanitarian aid has also made a contribution, for example in Pakistan, North Sudan, South Sudan and Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, let me underline an important aspect which was not covered by the report. We are concerned about the increasing number of mine victims resulting from mines laid by non-state actors. This is a serious issue which requires further reflection and action by all states that are party to the Ottawa Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to assure you that EU mine action will remain a prominent element of EU external action and to thank you again for this important report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rise in life expectancy linked to ageing is an extraordinary social achievement.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europeans today are living longer and enjoying a better and more desirable quality of life. However, it is precisely because of this success that we are faced with a more challenging employment and social protection situation. Moreover, there is no doubt that the increase in the average age of older people affects the social structure of each system in a number of ways.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union is experiencing, in fact, a steep increase in the proportion of older people and a large decline in the proportion of people aged below 50. We must therefore find ways of enhancing the labour market so as to ensure, as envisaged by the proposal that I endorsed, that the European Year for Active Ageing is an achievement that applies to the whole of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ageing is a challenge for the whole of society and for all generations in Europe. The section of the population comprising those over the age of 60 is increasing ever more quickly in Europe. That is all to the good, as it shows that we have succeeded in improving people’s well–being and quality of life in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Nevertheless, because of demographic change, we face new challenges. Matters that are being debated include the sustainability of financial provision for health care and public services, a shrinking population in certain regions, along with a decrease in their attractiveness, and pressure on pension funds.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The ageing section of our population is healthier and better educated than the previous generation. This is a worthwhile resource that needs to be harnessed. These people have plenty of potential for working and actively participating in social and family life, including voluntary work, lifelong learning, cultural activities and sport. The future of Europe will depend not just on the young, but also on those with experience of life.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, it is important that Parliament had the chance to adopt a position on the European Year for Active Ageing before the start of autumn, because, from the perspective of fundamental rights, the largest single group facing discrimination at present is older people.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is also especially crucial in the age of combating poverty and of active participation, as more and more older people are being discriminated against, both financially and also as regards the extent to which they have a say in their own everyday lives, local community planning and the content of the services that they receive. That is why it is important that national parliaments, the European Parliament and the European Union firmly stress the need for a perspective based on fundamental rights with a legal basis as regards older people, and for the practical programmes of measures which will be required in each Member State in order to accomplish this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important that we also ensure that each Member State appoints a coordinator by the end of September to be responsible for the programme’s implementation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am very grateful to the rapporteur Mr Kastler for drafting the report on the European Year for Active Ageing 2012 and making it possible for us to vote on it today in Parliament. I am pleased that we are talking about active ageing, because demographic change is not a theory, it is really happening. This is an issue which we in society must address together. However, we should emphasise not only the risks, but also the opportunities. As the previous speaker said, fortunately older people are not just remaining healthier for longer, they are also better educated and can stay active later in life. We should see this as an opportunity for society and make the most of it. A European Year of this kind can help to put this issue at the heart of the social debate.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the ageing population in the European Union is one of today’s major problems. At the same time, if we are able to handle this situation well, it could offer new possibilities. Nowadays we are able to live longer and healthier lives than ever before. Of course, this presents numerous challenges, especially in the area of employment and social protection. If we can ensure that people in their 50s and older remain on the labour market for a longer period, Europe could have an opportunity to accelerate revival, and exploit intergenerational social cohesion effectively.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The return of older generations to the labour market is also addressed by the Treaty of Lisbon. In many cases, these people are much more experienced and humble, and often work with more precision as well. The increase in life expectancy is an extraordinary social achievement and is one of the successes of our times. This is why we must ensure that these people can continue to participate actively in society and remain healthy and independent for as long as possible. However, this calls for governments, as well as the private sector, to take steps to be able to manage the ageing of the population. In my opinion, the approach proposed by the Commission, as well as the report which I supported with my vote, offer an excellent opportunity to realise this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I voted in favour of adopting the Kastler report on the European Year for Active Ageing. This week, news agencies reported that some scientists believe the first person to live to the age of 150 has already been born somewhere in the world. This shows the enormity of the challenges facing us. This is not about beating records for longevity. What is more significant is that the average age is increasing, and that the proportion of older people within the social structure is substantially larger than ever before. In turn, this means that solidarity, as one of the fundamental European values, is taking on ever greater significance in terms of intergenerational solidarity. It is therefore entirely justified to ensure that active ageing is one of our priorities. Paradoxically, strengthening intergenerational solidarity is also in the interests of young people. After all, today’s young people are tomorrow’s senior citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, perhaps the saddest line in all of European literature is Goethe’s observation that, in the end, we are all King Lear. We do not even have the consolation of thinking that Lear was mad and unaware of the wretchedness of his circumstances – that line of terrible pathos where he admits that, ‘to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind’.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one ageing entity which is not meeting its end with dignity, and that is the European Union. It is a mere 55 years old and it has become not only arthritic and irascible but is becoming, like the poor mad king, increasingly detached from reality. We saw it in the extraordinary press conference yesterday, where the President of the Commission and the President of the Council started blaming the crisis of the euro not on the intrinsic flaws of the single currency but on American rating agencies, as though somebody coming up with a better set of figures would solve the problem for them. It was impossible not to think of Lear on the heath: ‘I will do such things – what they are, yet I know not: but they shall be the terrors of the earth’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time has come, I think, for us to pronounce the verdict on the European Union, at age 55, as was pronounced on that poor unhappy king: ‘Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! He hates him much that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out longer’.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, firstly I want to congratulate my next-door neighbour, Martin Kastler here, for the excellent report he has placed before us and the recommendations it contains. I was happy to support him today.</p>
      <p sl="ga">It is good that people’s lives are stretched out longer, as previous speakers have mentioned, but that poses both a problem and also, of course, a challenge. The problem it poses is in relation, particularly, to pension funds and the retirement age, etc.: whether there should be voluntary retirement, compulsory retirement or, perhaps, phased retirement. These are issues that need to be looked at very carefully over the next number of years. Having an opportunity next year to focus on active ageing will give us that opportunity. I certainly think it is opportune.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I also hope that there will be a budget, as Martin Kastler here has said, so that we can implement the actions he has mentioned.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, what the European Union and the international community have done, or rather not done, about the situation in Syria is totally contrary to a citizen’s sense of justice. With Syria, it is obvious what must happen: the slaying of innocent people must stop, and those guilty of crimes must be brought to justice. International actors should be allowed access to the country, so that reliable information on the situation there can be obtained.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The European Union’s toothless reluctance to intervene in the serious breaches of human rights in its neighbouring countries is still a regrettable fact. We continue to debate the same basic question, which split opinion over Libya: how to intervene in a situation where the state is perpetrating violence against its own people? I wonder if, with Syria, we are looking at another Libya, as, at the same time, we show our own double standards.</p>

The European Union has a huge role to play, particularly in view of the current situation in the Arab countries.

      <p sl="es">To conclude, I began a speech of mine yesterday by saying that, in the Union, we need to move from ‘words to facts’. I hope that we can also manage to demonstrate with this initiative that the European Union is involved in the democratisation of the country and as such will work for equality.

      <p sl="fi">Europe must offer its neighbouring countries something more than just a stick to lean on. For example, genuine economic cooperation and support would promote economic growth, which in itself supports democratisation. Genuine democracy, however, always and only comes from within, from the people, and it cannot be forced on people from outside or from above.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Refusing economic cooperation purely on ideological grounds is hard to justify. Europe would stand to lose out if its eastern and southern neighbouring countries decided to turn away from a common European future.

In fact I think it is good that we have been discussing this today, because I think the European Union – uniquely – has an opportunity to influence the growth of democracy and human rights on the world stage that major powers such as the USA, the USSR (now Russia), China, etc., cannot do, because they would be seen to be taking care of their own vested interests, whereas we can be seen to be more objective. It is only right that we should put human rights at the forefront of our policies and, especially in this report, highlight the need for equality amongst the sexes and especially the treatment of women in so many countries around the world.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, political pluralism is the foundation of democracy and modern society, and the source of political legitimacy. However, for many years serious doubts have arisen concerning the freedom and transparency of Russian elections. The Russian democratic opposition has not succeeded in gaining a single seat in parliament for its representatives since 2003. The recent refusal to register the opposition People’s Freedom Party, the ninth such decision in recent years, gives rise to fundamental questions about the state of Russian democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I support the resolution and call on the Russian authorities to guarantee free and fair elections on the basis of the Council of Europe and OSCE standards. Placing restrictions on the political competition cannot be used as a way to retain power. I would also call for a stop to be put to actions aimed at politicising court judgments. The draft act enabling courts to ignore the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights is in itself a blatant infringement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The future of relations with Brussels will depend on whether democracy and the rule of law are strengthened in Russia.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I personally contributed to the resolution which we adopted today, and I naturally supported it. However, the reason why I want to explain my vote is that, in my view, we need to try in future to limit the number of resolutions which we adopt on some countries, especially Russia. We should focus on the way of working, which will allow us to have a more effective influence on the processes going on in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It is one of our most important partners. We would, of course, like to see more democracy and more respect for human rights. However, this comes about not only by adopting resolutions, but also through concrete action, with parliamentary diplomacy, which we could conduct more dynamically, along with more active contacts from the Commission and Council.</p>
      <p sl="bg">My advice to Russia’s leaders as a whole is for them to realise that creating administrative obstacles preventing the opposition from taking part in the elections is not a show of strength, but a show of weakness. I hope that they will quickly realise this and create the preconditions for truly democratic elections.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Schengen Agreement guarantees one of the most visible of the European Union’s freedoms: the free movement of persons. It is one of the most successful accomplishments of European integration, and we are all able to enjoy the fruits of that when we are travelling.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Changing the agreed rules will entail a far greater challenge than just a flow of migration caused by a few thousand immigrants from Europe’s neighbouring countries to the south. There is an important principle here, which is that the trend in European integration must not take a step backwards.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, however much I value the autonomy and rights of participation of the Member States, I am also an enthusiastic supporter of the European Union. It is not a European Union for politicians or for business. Above all, it is a European Union for the citizens who live here. The clearest expression of this for the citizens is freedom of travel and freedom of movement between the Member States within the European Union. We must defend this right effectively and we must nip in the bud any attempts to restrict freedom of travel on the basis of national interest or national egotism. We must make sure that this sort of thing is stopped before it even starts.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I naturally supported this resolution. It received great support in the European Parliament. I wanted to explain my vote because I would like to emphasise again that the proposals being tabled and the desire for changes to Schengen are the wrong solution to the problems which have arisen in recent months. I think that this would be a one-off fix, a panic approach to a problem which requires a more holistic approach.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The basic problems facing Schengen are that we need greater solidarity between the countries experiencing the biggest difficulties. We also need to strengthen the management and control of the borders within the Schengen area, and a new review could be carried out on the current status based on the same criteria also used to evaluate candidate countries. I feel that as long as Schengen is developing entirely at an intergovernmental level, such problems will continue. This is why it is appropriate to find a way for the European Parliament to play a greater role, and for the Commission as well.</p>
      <p sl="bg">One example is the debate on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. The European Parliament fulfilled its role in good time. Unfortunately, governments are still unable to find the right path to open the doors to both these countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, British Conservatives always abstain on Schengen issues because we are not members. Although we are disinterested, however, we are not uninterested in the future of the accord. There have been two great pillars of European integration in the decade and a bit that I have been serving here: the single currency and the free movement of peoples.</p>
      <p sl="en">You do not need me to elaborate on the crisis in the former. As for Schengen and the border-free zone, we can see that, too, beginning to fall apart as Denmark unilaterally imposes border controls, as the Italian and French governments reject the core principle, as the Netherlands begins to talk of deporting Eastern European workers and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Believe me when I say that no one in the United Kingdom can take any pleasure in the failure of these policies in countries which are our friends, our allies, our suppliers and our customers. It is in our interest to have a stable and prosperous union of countries on our border.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, more in hope than in expectation, let me offer the suggestion that, if you want to salvage something from European cooperation, it is better to work with the grain of democratic nation states than to try and impose centrally, by bureaucratic fiat, policies that harmonise and make uniform.</p>

That is one side of the coin. However, on the other hand we must ensure that aid for people who are suffering is always provided on the spot by the local region. The Member States have a major responsibility in this respect. For example, we in Germany have established a social security system which guarantees that no one in Germany needs to go hungry. We must ensure that this report, which is all about doing good, is implemented responsibly and without too much red tape.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, mines are a real problem in many parts of the world. Concern about anti–personnel landmines (APL), however, is greatest in countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia, Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although the prevention of the problems is first and foremost the responsibility of the states that have to endure them, the dangers posed by the mines must be averted through international cooperation prior to, during and after a conflict. The victim of a mine is not just the person who has stepped onto one, but also that person’s whole family and the local community.</p>
      <p sl="fi">All countries are under an international obligation to destroy stockpiles of APL, and the European Union needs to remind these countries of their obligations when it holds talks with them. The loss of human life, among the civilian population in particular, gives great cause for concern, and Europe must genuinely stand united on this. In addition, the inhabitants of areas that are suffering from these problems of mines, especially children, must be helped to live safely, so that they are aware of the dangers of mines.</p>

The goal of this initiative is to create a culture of lifelong active ageing in the European Union, based on a society for all ages. Promoting active ageing means creating better opportunities for older people to play their part in the labour market, combating poverty, fostering active participation in family life and society, promoting solidarity and cooperation between generations, and encouraging ageing with dignity.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report, because we need to take measures to properly gear the working environment to older people, to ensure health care for all older people and to give them the required social support. Unfortunately, a considerable number of older people experience old age as a time of marginalisation. Furthermore, if older people have to remain longer in the labour market, due to an extension of the retirement age for instance, we need to take specific action and provide these people with better employment opportunities, because only then will it be possible to eliminate the cause of poverty for this age group. Unfortunately, there are still frequent concerns that older people may become too great a burden for young people of working age, which may lead to tension between members of different generations. It is therefore essential to overcome this opinion and to remember the great benefits that older people bring today and which they may provide in the future. Moreover, active ageing is an effective tool for tackling poverty in old age. In society and the economy it must become clear that older people are not a burden, but an asset, owing to their experience, the work they have done and knowledge they have gained throughout their life. The European Year 2012 should therefore be a milestone for these developments in Europe, because the growing proportion of older people in Europe makes it more important than ever to promote healthy ageing.</p>

As an MEP, member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and doctor, I am particularly sensitive to this area of debate, which constitutes a challenge for the European Union. This topic concerns us all, directly or indirectly. The time has now come to discuss it. This initiative aims to stimulate debate and raise public awareness of the importance of active ageing and the role of older people within society. As the EU is confronted with the challenges of an ageing population, Member States are being called to devise new intelligent and sustainable policies. The European Parliament wants to make 2012 a year for setting precise objectives for Member States and thus for preventing our solidarity-based social security systems from collapsing beneath the financial burden of ageing populations.

The aim of active ageing is to create better opportunities and working conditions for older workers to ensure that they find a place in the labour market, and to fight social exclusion by increasing active involvement in society and support for healthy ageing.

      <p sl="pt">The ageing population is one of the biggest political challenges that the European Union currently faces and will continue to face. The increase in life expectancy and the improvement in public health allow people to live longer and healthier lives, which means that the non-active population is increasing at the same time that birth rates, stagnant since the 1980s, do not allow for the replacement of the working population, creating difficulties for social security systems. Eurostat’s demographic projections predict a decrease of about 6.8% in the number of people of working age by 2030. This means that there will be only two people of working age supporting each retired person, compared to a ratio of four to one today. As one can imagine, this means serious problems for the system’s sustainability. Because of this, bearing in mind that today we ‘age better’, it is necessary to find ways to ensure active, autonomous and healthy ageing, so that people over 65 remain in the job market or take on other forms of social contribution, whether by volunteering or helping their families, thus freeing up public resources and constituting real added value for societies.</p>

Given that 2012 is the European Year for Active Ageing, what is needed is the implementation of urgent and concerted measures that affirm Europe as a society for all ages and place people at the heart of politics, society and the economy. In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU and the Member States have to act effectively and in practical terms, as today we are already seeing a high unemployment rate amongst young people, and there are already difficulties in financing pension schemes. If the current demographic trend persists, in a few years we will see a profound change in the population structure and the age pyramid. By 2050 the number of young people between the ages of 0 and 14 years will decrease from 100 to 66 million, and the population of working age will fall from the current 331 to 268 million. On top of this, the number of people above the age of 80 will rise from 4.1% in 2005 to 11.4% in 2050. I call for an integrated response, based on the promotion of intergenerational fairness and solidarity, on the linking of pension schemes, budget and debt, as well as health care, rehabilitation, birth rate promotion, protection of the family and policies against discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Commission has declared 2012 to be the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity Between Generations. A vague concept like ‘active ageing’ could encompass many different ideas, which becomes clear in the contradictions of the report. On the one hand, it places an emphasis on the need for better employment opportunities, better health and safety conditions at work for older workers and more active policies regarding family affairs, and it addresses the issue of people with disabilities and chronic illnesses.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, there is cross-cutting support for the increase in the retirement age, and it points out that one of the effects of demographic ageing will be a change to European social models. It is thus necessary to reduce ‘the strains on health, pensions and social care systems’. We cannot back views that aim to align retirement age with average life expectancy (in their more extreme versions), as this constitutes an intolerable step backwards in terms of civilisation which even contradicts the struggle against unemployment. These are views that tend to ignore factors like the prospects opened up by scientific and technological progress and its profound impacts on the increase of productivity at work and which attempt to increase opportunities for exploiting the labour force.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Commission wants 2012 to be the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity Between Generations, using a vague concept of active ageing which could encompass many ideas, including some that are negative towards elderly people, this being evident in the contradictions of the report. On the one hand, it places an emphasis on the need for better employment opportunities, better health and safety conditions at work for older workers, more cooperation between young people, through the training of young workers by elderly workers and volunteering so that the elderly may share their skills, insisting on more active policies regarding family matters and raising the issue of people with disabilities and chronic illnesses.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, there is cross-cutting support for the increase in the retirement age, in that it points out that ‘healthy ageing can help raise labour market participation of older people, [and] enable them to be active in society for longer’. It adds that one of the effects of demographic ageing will be a change to European social models, aiming to reduce ‘the strains on health, pensions and social care systems’. We disagree with this vision, which aims to punish elderly people for their longer lives, while also harming young people and contributing to increasing unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The ageing population is one of the EU’s most important challenges, but also one of its biggest opportunities. The rise in life expectancy linked to ageing is certainly an extraordinary social achievement and a success of our time, as Europeans today are leading longer and healthier lives than ever before. However, this success also confronts European society with a number of challenges, in particular in the area of employment and social protection. In addition, old age is often associated with illness and dependency, and older people can feel excluded from employment, as well as from family and society. For these reasons, ageing can also be considered a challenge. The ways of meeting this challenge include the effort to ensure that people in their 50s and over can stay in the labour market longer, continue to be active participants in society and remain healthy and independent for as long as possible. The EU and its Member States have done a lot in the past to increase the life expectancy of citizens. Economic prosperity, social security and peace have brought about an improvement in the quality of life. The 2012 European Year should therefore mark a milestone for these developments in Europe, putting people at the centre of politics, society and the economy, and making European society a society for all ages.</p>

      <p sl="it">In these very worrying times, when we are told by Commissioner Andor that by 2060 the ratio of European pensioners to workers will have doubled, the European Commission has strategically proclaimed 2012 as the European Year for Active Ageing.</p>
      <p sl="it">The consequences of an ageing population affect social policies and public finances, but they make it necessary to improve the lives of older people, who must be given the chance to live a healthy and active life. Hence 2012 must be viewed as an opportunity to build a Europe in which people are not afraid to grow old!</p>
      <p sl="it">It is important to rediscover the role played by older people in society: they are an irreplaceable asset for the entire Community, an asset that we must not give up. A professor at the University of Padova – my hometown – used to say that whenever old people die, a wealth of knowledge disappears with them – and I agree with him. The European Year is aimed at raising public awareness, promoting debate and the exchange of experience between the various EU countries, and facilitating the drafting of ad hoc policies, in order to integrate older people more into active society and to encourage intergenerational solidarity, all in an effort to ensure that old age as such is a wonderful time of life.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Whether there is any need to organise these costly and utterly useless ‘European Year’ events raises questions on an overall level. With the ‘Year for Active Ageing’, we have gone further than ever before. We must quickly disabuse those who have been misled by the Newspeak employed and interpret the term ‘active’ as promoting social or sporting involvement by older people, enhancing the contribution they can make to society on a volunteer basis, encouraging ageing in full health, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not what this European Year is about. It is about planning a year of propaganda aimed at changing attitudes towards keeping people of retirement age at work, and for as long as possible at that. Perhaps it will promote keeping them at work until they die, which would generate huge savings for our pension systems. This European Year is a kind of psychological comfort for the restrictive policies implemented by Member States on the orders of Brussels. What a great thing ‘social Europe’ is.</p>

Older people must be able to play a greater and more active role in life, because their experience and the work they do are important for their families and for their professions. This is one possible way of maintaining solidarity between the generations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">By designating 2012 as a European Year for Active Ageing, Member States and European institutions are making a firm commitment to improving labour opportunities and conditions for older workers, to intergenerational solidarity and to achieving better inclusion of older people in our society.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document, because it is aimed at designating 2012 as the European Year for Active Ageing and allocating money for this from the EU budget. Eurostat’s demographic projections predict a decrease of about 6.8% of people of working age in 2030. Thus, there will only be two people of working age (15-64) to support one retired person (over 65), compared to a ratio of four to one today. The EU will therefore experience a steep increase in the number of older people and a large decline in the proportion of the population aged below 50, which may, in turn, increase pressure on public budgets and pension systems, as well as on social and care services. Furthermore, old age is still often associated with illnesses and dependence on other people, and older people can feel unwanted by the labour market, their families and community life. The proposed initiative would encourage and support the efforts of Member States, their regional and local authorities, social partners and civil society to promote active ageing and to do more to mobilise the potential of the rapidly growing population currently in their 50s and above. The European Year should therefore serve as a framework for raising awareness, for identifying and disseminating good practice and, most importantly, for encouraging policymakers and stakeholders at all levels to promote active ageing.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of Compromise Amendment No 53 to the Kastler Report ‘on the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations (2012)’, since I fully support the idea of raising awareness of the consequences of population ageing for society, and putting the issue on the political agenda. With regard to EU policies, I strongly believe that policy makers should pay more attention to the issues and challenges that result from population ageing, regardless of the policy field. Population ageing should indeed be treated from an overarching and holistic perspective. The consequences of population ageing are too often overlooked or even ignored, in particular those with regard to social security, pension acquirement and eligibility, and (long term) care provision. Since the Kastler report does not offer effective and long-term solutions with regard to guaranteeing, maintaining, and improving social security – in particular pensions and care provisions – I abstained in the final vote.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In view of the fact that between now and 2035 the number of people aged 60 and over will increase by around two million people per year, attention should be paid to solidarity and intergenerational cooperation not only in the European Union, but also throughout the world. Personally, I believe that we should promote opportunities for older people to participate actively in civic life, speak up about voluntary work, make it easier for senior citizens to access new technologies and provide training for use of the latter. At the same time, we must encourage the Member States, local authorities and non-governmental organisations to support measures aimed at older people. There can be no doubt that our aim should be to combat their social exclusion, since the ageing of the population is currently one of the most important challenges facing the European Union. Once again, I would stress that the proposed initiative by the European Parliament and the Council for a European Year for Active Ageing in 2012 is an excellent project, and I therefore voted in favour of its adoption.

For these reasons, population ageing may be considered as a huge challenge, if not a hazard, or it could offer new opportunities for European society, depending on how well we prepare for it. One way to meet this challenge consists in ensuring that the population aged around 60 or over can remain in the labour market for longer, continue to be active participants in society and remain healthy and independent as long as possible.

      <p sl="fr">It is wrong to consider ageing as a factor which will impact society’s social development negatively. Provided that older people retain a full role in society, they certainly do not constitute a burden because they can contribute to overall development, whether it be in an active role or as a consumer. Older people, who are increasingly healthy in body and mind, are in the process of ridding themselves of their traditional status as people who are marginalised and who need protecting somewhat paternalistically, and are becoming active participants in their own lives as well as in economic, social and cultural areas of society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allowing everyone the freedom to choose how to live their lives is only possible in as far as people have sufficient income. That is why more opportunities and possibilities in the labour market should be offered to workers of over 50, and the idea that older workers displace younger people should be dispelled. Society needs elders for their experience, expertise and flexibility. This is a crucial issue, and the promotion of active ageing also presupposes the improvement of intergenerational solidarity and cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In view of the substantial demographic changes over recent decades, the creation of a sustainable culture of lifelong active ageing is becoming a political priority. Not only is there a rapid increase in the European population approaching 60 years of age and older, but it is also healthier and better educated on the whole than previous generations. Opportunities must therefore be created for this population to engage actively in work life, social life and family life. Such activities will not only be socially beneficial, but will also help older people to maintain their mental and physical health. The isolation of elderly people is undesirable both for society and for the individuals concerned. A leading role is played in this area by local and regional authorities, which must take account of the enormous potential, qualifications and knowledge of the elderly people living in a given region and give them a chance to get involved in local and regional projects and initiatives, enabling them to contribute to the development of their community. Within the framework of intergenerational solidarity, it is therefore important to support the active involvement of elderly people in society without discrimination, and to support their healthy ageing, vitality and dignity through high-quality health care, long-term care and social services.

      <p sl="ro">In order to promote active ageing it is of paramount importance to enhance solidarity and cooperation between the generations. This solidarity must not be approached solely from a financial perspective, but has also to be viewed in a wider context, encompassing the promotion of mutual cooperation and exchanges between the generations so that each of them can find its place in society and make its contribution to European society to the best of its abilities. European society has to become a society for all ages. Governments and public policies have to respond to this challenge in a number of areas, in particular by putting in place framework conditions to deal with the consequences of an ageing population. The private sector, social partners and civil society, as well as individual citizens, have to make their respective contributions. All these stakeholders are key factors in providing solutions to the challenge of Europe’s ageing society. The Commission and Member States must take into account gender mainstreaming, the inclusion of people with disabilities and people belonging to ethnic minorities, especially the Roma minority, when running European Year events.

Active ageing means creating better opportunities and working conditions to enable older workers to play their part in the labour market, combating social exclusion by fostering active participation in society, and encouraging healthy ageing.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. Population ageing is one of the EU’s most important challenges but also one of the biggest opportunities. The rise in life expectancy linked to ageing is certainly an extraordinary social achievement and a success of our time. Europeans today are living longer and healthier lives than ever before, which is a positive and encouraging development. However, this success also confronts European society with a number of challenges, in particular in the area of employment and social protection. To illustrate this, Eurostat’s demographic projections expect a decrease of about 6.8% (20.8 million) in people of working age in 2030. Thus, only two people of working age (15-64) will have to support one retired person (over 65), compared to a ratio of four to one today. The EU will therefore experience a steep increase in the share of older people and a large decline in the share of population aged below 50, which may, in turn, increase pressure on public budgets and pension systems, as well as on the social and care provision for older people. In addition, old age is often associated with illness and dependency, and older people can feel excluded from employment as well as from family and society.</p>

      <p sl="it">From 2012, the population aged 60 and over will increase by two million people per year.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need to establish a framework for action aimed at raising awareness of the contribution older people can make to society and at strengthening the dialogue between generations. The European Commission has decided to launch this initiative with the aim of creating new and improved employment opportunities and working conditions for the growing number of older people in Europe, helping them to play an active role in society.</p>
      <p sl="it">The challenge for all stakeholders is to improve the options available to older people, intervening in sectors as diverse as employment, health care, social services, adult education, voluntary work, housing, information services and transport. Thanks to policies promoting active ageing, older people will be offered more opportunities and will be able to carry on contributing to the common good.</p>

      <p sl="it">2012 will be the European Year for Active Ageing.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission’s decision stems from the knowledge that the number of older people in the Member States is continually increasing, a phenomenon linked to the low birth rate and the rise in life expectancy, thanks in part to medical and scientific research. The task for Europe is to consider older people not as a burden on society but as an opportunity, by enabling them, for example, to carry out voluntary work at all levels.</p>
      <p sl="it">Under the Treaty, which puts all European citizens on the same footing with the same rights, the European Union must strive to ensure equal dignity and equal access for older people with disabilities. The text has some positive aspects, but the desire to include candidate countries too in the projects led me to abstain, as I fear that European citizens’ money will be spent unnecessarily.</p>

      <p sl="pt">General population ageing is a phenomenon common to the whole of the European Union, which will change considerably over the next 20 years. During the 1995-2015 period, it is estimated that the 20-29 age group will lose 11 million people (–20%), whereas the 50-64 age group will increase by 16.5 million (+25%). I am voting in favour of this report because I believe that Europe must increasingly concern itself with the active and healthy ageing of its citizens, by defining programme actions that stimulate or increase independence, prevent accidents, provide rehabilitation following illness and promote the practice of sporting activities throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Year for Active Ageing must also be seen as an opportunity to establish greater intergenerational solidarity, given that the exchange of knowledge between elderly people and young people will both improve the future generations’ qualifications and skills and allow the life experience of the elderly to be valued. It should also be a year geared towards making European companies aware of the importance of developing new products and services aimed at meeting the special needs of this particular sector of the population.</p>

      <p sl="fr">What hides behind this new concept of active ageing?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I voted against this report on the European Year for Active Ageing (2012).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course the report contains a number of positive ideas such as the fight against age-based discrimination, the development of social and health services particularly in terms of access, and the promotion of lifelong learning and volunteer work for older people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, these are merely fine words which are contradicted by the reality of the policies being implemented. Moreover, the concept of ‘active ageing’ is ambiguous, to say the least. It is another way of telling people that they must work ever longer and ever more, and this is clearly stated in the resolution, which says that we must ‘mobilise the potential of older persons’ in order ‘to enable their participation in the labour market’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have other things to offer older people, starting with ceasing to pit them against young people and offering them a true place in society in which the skills they have accumulated are taken into account and in which acquired social rights are protected thus allowing them to age in a dignified manner. That is the challenge which the European Year must address.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is a very good idea to make 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations, in particular in the light of the current debate on future demographic change.

      <p sl="sk">As Europe’s demographic crisis deepens, Member States are gradually responding by increasing the retirement age. The European Year for Active Ageing will actually not last one, but many years. Mr Kastler’s report mentions the need to highlight, in this situation, the importance of intergenerational solidarity, which is crucial if the challenges resulting from the higher proportion of older people in the general population are to be handled successfully. Member States and the EU seriously failed in their family policy in the past, obliging us to address ageing-related issues in earnest. Any further failure could be fatal for Europe. The declaration of 2012 as the Year for Active Ageing is a great opportunity to train the spotlight on genuine values: human dignity and intergenerational solidarity. However, we also need to start tackling the yawning gaps in the area of social and health care for pensioners in the various EU Member States, and discuss how to close those gaps while respecting the competences of Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">There is no doubt that population ageing is a burden on European public budgets, and especially on the pension systems of individual Member States. For this very reason we must endeavour to promote an effective active ageing policy that offers older people the opportunity to continue to work, stay healthy for longer and play an active role in society despite their advancing years.</p>
      <p sl="it">The proposal relating to the European Year for Active Ageing can doubtless make an important contribution, enabling older workers to play their part in the labour market, combating social exclusion and fostering active participation in society through a kind of ‘healthy’ ageing.

      <p sl="pl">The debate on the demographic future of Europe is one of the most important and most serious debates held in the European Parliament. It relates to elderly people, quality of life in advanced age and the future of every one of us. This is a great challenge from which we Europeans may benefit greatly, in spite of the many associated risks. The designation of 2012 as the European Year for Active Ageing is a very valuable initiative. We must be aware of all the consequences of the ageing of European society, and also do everything in our power to eliminate the negative effects of this process. Our potential contributions to these measures, as Members of the European Parliament, certainly include promotion of the European programmes Leonardo da Vinci and Grundtvig. Thanks to these programmes, senior citizens’ organisations are implementing ever more ambitious plans, and encouraging an ever greater number of senior citizens to become active. I would also like to add that I myself, working with my local assistants, cooperate with the University of the Third Age, and our contacts bring us mutual benefits. I would therefore like to encourage others to undertake similar measures, so that the year 2012 helps to bring about a radical increase in active ageing.</p>

I also want to stress our serious concern about the increasingly bad humanitarian situation in Yemen and in Bahrain. The unconditional release of all peaceful demonstrators, including political activists, journalists and human rights defenders is a matter of priority. The national dialogue launched by King Hamad in Bahrain can produce effective results only if the participation of all political forces is granted.

The European Union therefore has a responsibility to call for decisive action in the context of the UN to defend people’s rights; to support their legitimate representatives in implementing policies to improve citizens’ living conditions; to reduce social inequalities; to ensure the development of true democracy; to combat corruption and nepotism; and to guarantee respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

This motion for a resolution is evidence of the usual double standards of the EU. On the one hand, they make claims about ‘civilian protection’ to justify wars of aggression against sovereign countries, whereas these wars are based on very different interests and motivations. This is the case in Libya, which has been subject to air strikes, as well as the development of open foreign intervention in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, on the other hand, they praise the reforms in Morocco, while remaining silent over the country’s illegal occupation of Western Sahara and oppression of the Sahrawi people since the 1970s. There is also absolute silence on the situation of constant aggression in Palestine unleashed by Israel.

Attention should be drawn to the fact that, in both Yemen and Bahrain, the current situation is a major cause for concern. The chaos in the State of Bahrain, and Iran’s involvement in the internal affairs of this kingdom in the Persian Gulf, pose a danger not just to the population of this country but to the entire region. Consequently, we must review and implement the European Neighbourhood Policy more effectively, and provide humanitarian or other necessary aid, so that peace and democracy might be restored in this region.</p>

I would also like to highlight the need to involve civil society in the monitoring of budget support. Similarly, there is no doubt as to the importance of an independent judiciary and independent media in shaping and regulating the democratic process with the aim of strengthening the rule of law, building democratic institutions, including an efficient parliament that reflects political pluralism, and strengthening the role of civil society.</p>

      <p sl="el">The European Parliament report on EU external policies in favour of democratisation could very well be used as a manual by every imperialist secret service for imperialist intervention in every country on the planet, with the difference that the European Parliament cynically and frankly proclaims in this report that the EU has the ‘right’ to intervene in every corner of the planet, using the vulgar pretext of ‘protecting human rights and democracy’. The political face of imperialism recommends that the EU institutions exert pressure on and openly coerce the government of any country, using its economic relations with the EU as a lever and that the EU impose democracy and human rights clauses – in the imperialist euro-unifying sense of the terms – in all its economic and trade relations with third countries and then impose economic (and hence political) sanctions, by reducing or cutting off any funding provided by the EU, if they do not comply with the imperialist Union’s perception of democracy and human rights.

I fully support the proposal for the establishment of a forum bringing together national parliaments and the European Parliament to consider foreign policy issues, particularly on sensitive subjects such as human rights and democracy. The events unfolding in North Africa and the Middle East have proven the limitations of a focus on security and stability, which has failed to reduce poverty and social injustice. ‘Security versus democracy’ is a false dilemma, as we all know there can be no human security within a society without a democratic and accountable government. I strongly believe that the fight against inequalities has to become an essential objective of the Union’s external policy and that the European Parliament must supervise these aspects more closely. For all these reasons, as underlined by this report, the Council and Commission must involve the European Parliament in every stage of the negotiation, conclusion, application and suspension of international agreements with third countries.</p>

I also believe that it is useful to alert the Commission about maintaining a more emphatic approach when it suspects breaches of the agreements based on the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+) Regulation. Finally I consider the proposed section on supporting civil society in the resolution to be an excellent idea because it will energise it, utilise the knowledge that it has available, and integrate it in terms of participation and responsibility, which is one of the key features of the operation of a healthy democracy.</p>

The EU has a whole variety of instruments, intended to support democracy and human rights throughout the world, but currently those instruments are not being used efficiently enough. Consequently, the resolution adopted by Parliament calls on the EU institutions to allocate assistance more coherently and effectively and for this to be coordinated and based on a standard methodology tailored to the situation in each country. However, the resolution points to another shortcoming in current EU assistance for developing democracy in third countries, namely the inconsistent imposition of EU sanctions and criminal measures for countries that ignore their international obligations, and blatantly violate human rights and democratic principles. The European Parliament thus proposes enhancing the support provided with fair, measured and intelligent sanctions that would facilitate adequate and efficient responses to failure by third countries to meet international commitments to democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support this report on EU external policies in support of democratisation, while highlighting at the same time the need for a new European approach to this end. The EU needs to overhaul its approach to promoting democracy in the world while simultaneously placing values, coherence and a genuine culture of results at the heart of the project. Doing so requires an inclusive and more coherent policy that merges together the various external policy spheres, a central role for the European Parliament and evaluations of the different instruments in accordance with the results they produce, not simply how they operate. We must value the important role social movements have played in the recent revolutions within the Arab world. Support from Europe for civil society and trade unions, mutual societies, political parties, associations of women and young people, farmers’ groups, NGOs, social movements and activists must be stepped up in order to enable them to become better organised. The new European External Action Service, through detailed knowledge of conditions on the ground, should serve to identify these. Moreover, there must be a firm emphasis on freedom and protection for the media as well as on social, cultural and political rights.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Human rights and democracy are founding values of the European Union and they must serve as a guide for its external action. This report on the European Union’s external policy in support of democracy reminds us of the actions which the EU undertakes to support democracy throughout the world: electoral observation missions, assistance with institution building, protection of human rights campaigners, support for civil society, and so on. In 2006, during the last presidential, parliamentary and provincial elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the EU sent a large team of observers mandated to verify the proper functioning of the elections and to endorse the democratic character of the results produced from the ballot boxes. I voted in favour of this report namely because it highlights the importance of establishing realistic and achievable recommendations at the end of every observation mission, the implementation of which should be supported by the EU. Providing monitoring and support is the best way of guaranteeing ownership of recommendations and thus of enabling emerging democracies to become competent in using the tools necessary for elections, which represent a key component of democracy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union should resist excessive pragmatism concerning the promotion of democracy in the world and should equip itself with versatile and imaginative mechanisms to allow it to interact with the public and their movements working locally to that end. The recent upheavals in the Muslim world have made evident the need for appropriate knowledge and interaction and for placing democracy and human rights among the principal priorities of the European Union. Therefore, declarations and legislative texts are not enough in and of themselves; they must be translated through direct knowledge into concrete measures that reinforce our capacity for action and influence, at the same time as we strengthen our international legitimacy and our ‘soft power’. Establishing a European Endowment for Democracy would be an excellent step in that direction. Rather than being an island where citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees are respected and promoted, the EU should put its experience at the service of those who need it.</p>

Changes in the external environment, as well as internal reforms, both require us to refocus on human rights and democratic strategies. The European Union’s starting point is clear. It seeks to defend the universality and indivisibility of human rights – civil, political, economic, social and cultural – while maintaining the principle that the human rights of women and girls are an integral and indivisible element of universal human rights. Human rights protection, along with support for multiparty democracy and the guaranteed rule of law, are among the European Union’s central and fundamental objectives, together with the fight against poverty. These efforts should also be supported by global actors, such as multinational corporations, in order to contribute to human rights improvements around the world; their often considerable influence should be used to support developing countries before these countries are undermined in their own efforts to achieve sustainable development.</p>

If a democratisation process is to be successful, it is crucial that it should address the social and economic development of the country concerned and ensure that basic human rights – education, health and employment – are met. European aid to support authoritarian states does not always guarantee democratic development; therefore it is the outputs of aid, rather than the inputs, on which we should focus. Furthermore, legitimate democratic political parties, genuine social movements and a free press must play a fundamental role in safeguarding the public interest by overseeing the transparency and accountability of governments and supporting women in their struggle for equal rights. We believe it is necessary to prioritise in-depth dialogue on democratic values and norms with actors engaged in all democracy-strengthening processes, as building and strengthening democratic institutions can help to enhance economic development and reduce poverty.

      <p sl="en">The EU needs to shift from a stability to a democracy paradigm. In the area of human rights and democracy, it needs to establish greater consistency between its values and democracy as it is actually practised, between its internal and its external policies, and between the institutions. The EU consequently has a duty, through its different programmes, to strengthen its support for civil society and social movements (trade unions, mutual societies, women’s networks and youth networks), supporting the spread of those movements. However, it must also take steps to promote the freedom of expression of independent media and the protection of journalists and human rights defenders. It is important to emphasise the need for a gender perspective in the implementation of the guidelines, with targeted actions in favour of female human rights defenders and other particularly vulnerable groups, such as journalists and defenders working to promote economic, social and cultural rights, children's rights, and minority rights.

The resolution stresses the European Parliament: 1. believes that only democracies based on the rule of law can function as a foundation for balanced structural partnerships between third countries and the EU that are also in keeping with the needs and interests of both parties and their respective populations; 2. stresses that partnerships based on dialogue and consultation enhance ownership of democracy-building processes and elements of democratic governance; calls on all EU institutions to make greater efforts to use these dialogues in a more coherent, consistent and coordinated manner; 3. considers that the EU’s role as a ‘soft power’ in the international system can only be consolidated if protection of human rights constitutes a real priority for it in its policy towards third countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report does indeed concern the need for the EU’s external policy position to change in situations where democratisation is neither objective nor coherent.

      <p sl="fr">However, the report does not place sufficient emphasis on the responsibility of the EU as regards the extent of the implementation of human rights within the EU, and in particular of its own trade agreements which contain clauses on democracy and human rights and which too often are not applied on account of diplomatic and political choices by Member States. Furthermore, this report does not sufficiently recognise the principle of non-interference in the processes of democratic transition, and it focuses too much on funding and on the proliferation of additional tools and bodies, while the real issue is one of political will.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Political stability, economic development and democracy do not constitute three separate areas of foreign policy. The three are intertwined – the removal of one would affect the other two. Events in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Syria and the Arabian Peninsula mirror the double standards of the foreign policy pursued by European countries and the EU itself. In her report, Mrs De Keyser points out the continuing inconsistency in the way Europe applies its values in relation to third countries. In January this year, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs noted that each cooperation agreement concluded by the EU with another country incorporates a clause demanding respect for human rights. The report before us, however, calls attention to the fact that the existence of this contractual condition is not in itself enough, as penalties for violations are seldom imposed in practice. If the EU genuinely wants to be an important global player, or a superpower, it must be consistent in its values. Long-term, stable relations between states are built on trust and reliability. Instead of merely paying lip service to its values, the EU must do more to assert them at every opportunity. This is the only way to earn the trust of its partners.</p>

Political pluralism is a pillar of democracy and of modern society and a source of political legitimacy. The European Court of Human Rights has condemned the Russian Federation for human rights violations in many cases and the implementation of these decisions continues to be inadequate. It is important, therefore, that the EU speaks with one voice, shows solidarity and unity in its relations with the Russian Federation, and bases these relations on mutual interests and common values, while reaffirming its conviction that Russia continues to be one of the EU’s most important partners in strategic cooperation.

We Members of the European Parliament strongly deplore the decision by the Russian authorities to reject the registration of the People’s Freedom Party (PARNAS) for the forthcoming Duma elections in December 2011. It is not acceptable that Russia, which is one of the European Union’s most important partners in building strategic cooperation, does not guarantee free and fair elections – which are the basis of a democratic society and one of the EU’s main values. I would like to stress once again that the State Duma elections should be based on the implementation of the election standards set by the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and that the Russian authorities must allow the OSCE/Council of Europe to carry out a long-term election observation mission and must cooperate fully with it from its earliest stage.

If its intentions to curb pluralism, prevent the free participation of democratic choices in elections and pass a law to override the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights were to be confirmed, this would be an extremely serious situation. Both of these actions are an attack on democracy and on the substance of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is inappropriate for a country that behaves in this way to have a seat in institutions such as the Council of Europe.</p>

The desires and aspirations for a full democracy and for the election of a parliament that represents the will of the people, will be fulfilled in this way. The Russian authorities’ authorisation of an election observation mission by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe/Council of Europe during an extended period and their complete cooperation with this would reinforce the international credibility of the election and allow international experts to assess and endorse it.

      <p sl="pt">Russia’s democratisation process lacks the depth and maturity needed to provide an environment of trust and stability for relations with the European Union, which is fundamental to the development of stronger, more lasting and more sustainable bilateral relations. The limits to democratic freedom and freedom of expression, to guarantees of human rights and to the independence of the judicial system that exist today in Russia are evident. We must bear in mind that we are talking about a recent democracy with its own particular history.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is obvious that the socioeconomic and even cultural evolution of the country is not being accompanied by the political system, with consequences for the development of the state and its relations with the rest of the world. The complexity of legislation foments bureaucracy, corruption, subordination of the courts and manipulation of the law, which has allowed the state to reject a new political party in the new electoral process. Within this framework, I agree that the European Union must move forward prudently in the negotiation of a new agreement with Russia, and maintain its reservations regarding the significant development of a new partnership and cooperation agreement until the results of the Russian Duma elections in December and presidential elections of 2012 have come out and have been assessed.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Relations between the European Union and Russia have constantly evolved in recent decades, leading to a profound and complex interdependency which is bound to become even stronger in the future. The conclusion of a strategic partnership agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation remains the key to the further development and intensification of cooperation between the two partners. Obviously, however, developments in the Russian Federation regarding the observance and protection of human rights and respect for commonly agreed democratic principles, rules and procedures are still a cause for concern. The Russian Federation, as a full member of the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations, is committed to the principles of democracy and human rights promoted by these organisations. The difficulties which are faced by political parties seeking to register for elections and which undeniably undermine political competition in Russia, limiting voter choice and showing that there are still real obstacles to political pluralism in the country, are also disturbing because this is a cornerstone of democracy and modern society and a source of political legitimacy. It would also be expedient for the State Duma elections to be based on the application of election rules set by the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and therefore I believe it would be proper for the Russian authorities to allow the OSCE/Council of Europe to establish a long-term election observation mission and to cooperate with it from the outset.</p>

Freedoms of expression, association and assembly in the Russian Federation are frequently threatened. The initiatives and activities of human rights defenders, independent civil society organisations, political opponents, independent media and ordinary citizens are often restricted or hindered. Therefore, we believe it is crucial to decrease the hurdles for the registration of new parties, to secure equal conditions for all candidates and parties during the election campaign and, above all, to guarantee access to the media for all.

The resolution also states that effective support for Member States in order to assure compliance with the Schengen acquis in case of pressure at external borders can already be fully addressed through the new Schengen evaluation system, which is currently being redefined in ordinary legislative procedure.

      <p sl="fr">On the occasion of the adoption of this resolution, Parliament has reaffirmed its support for Schengen: the free movement of people throughout the EU is one of the four fundamental freedoms, and one of the fundamental acquis of the Community in which we live. That is why we are now sceptical about attempts being made to bring these agreements back into question and the introduction of a safeguard clause to reintroduce border controls. The attitude of certain countries during the Lampedusa crisis stirred up fear and led nations to look in on themselves with one Member State even bringing back border controls. Schengen must be respected, and the issue of the safeguard clause must be examined with a great deal of attention and, most importantly, any management of Schengen must be at European level. It is outrageous to see immigration solely in terms of threat. Zero immigration is outrageously utopian; migration, whether legal or illegal, has always existed.

It is ineffective, because it will not remedy the problems it is trying to tackle. Moreover, it fails to recognise the positive effects that the Schengen Agreement has on the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of people, and on economic development as a result of the free movement principle. Finally, it violates procedures previously established in the border codes to re-establish border controls, which are well defined and specified in terms of causes and procedures in the current regulations.</p>

Indeed, for a variety of reasons the area of free movement has recently been under threat, and this has sparked much public debate over how the Schengen area should be managed and maintained in future. I am convinced that we do not have to reform the current framework, but simply enhance it, because the Schengen rules defined in the Schengen Borders Code already set out the conditions and procedures for the temporary reintroduction of border controls at internal borders. On the other hand, this framework has several shortcomings and could be improved. Firstly, it is unilateral and, consequently, it is impossible to give priority to the EU’s collective interest. Strengthening the Schengen framework in future should change this. Secondly, the mechanism established for evaluating how the Member States are complying with the provisions of the Schengen acquis , where the evaluation is carried out by an intergovernmental working group, is clearly insufficient.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted to adopt the European Parliament resolution on changes to Schengen because the creation of the Schengen area and the integration of the Schengen acquis into the EU framework is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process, marked by the absence of controls at internal borders and unprecedented freedom of movement within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The freedom of movement has become one of the foundations of EU citizenship and one of the cornerstones of the EU as an area of freedom, security and justice, enshrining the right to move and reside freely in any Member State while enjoying the same rights, guarantees and protections, including the ban on all forms of discrimination based on nationality. This is why there is an urgent requirement to remove all the barriers which Romanian and Bulgarian citizens are still faced with and to strongly condemn the attempt by some Member States to reintroduce border controls, thereby jeopardising the very spirit of the Schengen acquis .</p>

      <p sl="fr">The democratic movements in the Arab countries and the war in Libya have given rise to large-scale movements of persons bound for the European Union, and they continue to do so. Many countries, faced with this enormous influx of migrants and refugees, have called for the Schengen Agreements to be reviewed and, on 24 June, the European Council (as representative of the Member States) asked the Commission to present a proposal on a safeguard mechanism to deal with exceptional circumstances of this sort and thus allow the reintroduction of controls at internal borders. The European Parliament reiterates its total opposition to any new Schengen mechanism and deplores the fact that several Member States, such as France, Italy and even Denmark, are trying to reintroduce border controls. The problems we have met of late are the result, in many cases, of the reluctance of Member States to implement a common European policy regarding asylum and immigration, which our Parliament has long been anxious to see. If we are to deal with these exceptional circumstances, we need greater solidarity amongst the Member States. Schengen must be strengthened rather than weakened. We also need to be able to manage our external border controls better and not create barriers between nations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Freedom of movement within the European Union is one of the most remarkable things about the process of integrating its component States, and one of the most emblematic factors of the good brought about by this process. Restricting this freedom would be a backward step that our people would have difficulty getting used to. Nonetheless, it is undeniable that the ability to move freely throughout the European Union and the end of internal border controls have raised problems for certain Member States which often have to deal with illegal immigration. It is therefore necessary to search for balanced solutions to this problem without permanently threatening something that Europeans greatly value and which is essential for maintaining an area of true freedom, security and justice. It is also necessary to reinforce the Member States’ ability to control the external borders, assess how they apply the Schengen criteria and get them to adopt better practices to improve solidarity and information transmission, thus strengthening their objectives, preventing abuses and preventing situations of border tension.</p>

The influx of migrants, coming mainly from Africa and the Middle East, to the EU’s external borders has added to the responsibilities of Member States with external borders, but it cannot justify additional derogations or exceptional measures to the Schengen system that aim especially at reintroducing internal borders or barriers to free movement in the European area.

      <p sl="sk">In the last year in particular, there has been a massive displacement of people from Northern African countries, and the Schengen system has recently come under pressure, with some Member States considering the reintroduction of national border controls in the face of a sudden influx of migrants. Conditions for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls in exceptional circumstances where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security are already set out clearly in the Regulation on the Schengen Borders Code. Nevertheless, current problems with the influx of immigrants should not be a pretext for further exceptions, as this would place the Schengen idea in serious jeopardy. The free movement of people within the Schengen area has been one of the biggest achievements of European integration. Schengen has a positive impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of EU citizens, both by making border crossing convenient and by boosting the economy. Freedom of movement is a fundamental right and a pillar of EU citizenship, so I take the view that the role of the Union, and hence the Commission, should be to plan how to share migration pressures from the Mediterranean between the Member States, and how to cope effectively with the integration of immigrants.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Schengen is a failure. The citizens of Europe had been promised that the dismantling of EU internal border controls would go hand in hand with the strengthening of external border controls and the maintenance of a high level of security.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What has really happened? Europe has become a sieve. External border controls are not sufficient. There is a general political laxity as regards the management of migratory flows in general, and of so-called asylum seekers, in particular. This laxity has been fuelled by European laws developed by Brussels, which is of the firm belief that the massive importation of immigrants from beyond the boundaries of Europe will solve our economic, social and even demographic problems!</p>
      <p sl="fr">All Member States have the right, and even the duty, to manage their borders and to control the goods and people who cross them. What the recent, on-going Lampedusa crisis has shown is that the absence of internal border controls is a powerful incentive for any would-be illegal immigrant to rush to any easily accessible point of Europe. They know that, thereafter, it will be easy for them to exploit our laws and this lack of control to go wherever they like.</p>

We are therefore considering the possibility of reintroducing controls at national borders. I believe that establishing any new additional exception to the current rules, such as a new basis for reintroducing internal border controls in exceptional circumstances would do nothing to enhance the Schengen framework. It should be noted that the influx of migrants and asylum seekers at the external borders cannot in itself be considered another reason for reintroducing border controls.</p>

If we limit ourselves to the current criteria for ‘public policy and public security’, Member States will continue to act unilaterally, adopting a broad interpretation of these criteria in the event of increased migratory pressures. If this happens, we run the risk of conflating immigration and insecurity when what we need is to respond to migratory pressures. By contrast, the proposed device aims to create a mechanism enabling controls to be reintroduced at borders only under exceptional circumstances, as a last resort and through a European mechanism. Now we need to strengthen the governance of the Schengen area. The aim of this initiative is precisely to enable us to provide responses to the crisis that the Schengen area is going through at the moment. This crisis is particularly associated with the fact that certain Member States are no longer able to ensure that they respect their obligations under the Schengen acquis when it comes to effectively controlling their sections of the external borders.</p>

We must strengthen political governance of the Schengen area, develop a genuine European immigration and asylum policy, and develop the role of the European Frontex agency. We are not talking about undermining freedom of movement within the Schengen area, but of adapting this agreement to the reality on the ground in terms of migration. I do not, in fact, consider the content of this resolution to be wise, as it refuses on principle any enlargement of the criteria which allow for the reintroduction, on a temporary and exceptional basis, of internal border controls. This resolution runs counter to the conclusions of the European Council and the proposals recently made by the Commission, which I found to be balanced and realistic. It is important to review the current criteria for ‘public policy and public security’, which are not appropriate for current circumstances and which give the Member States too much freedom when it comes to their interpretation, particularly in the case of intense migratory pressures, with the ultimate risk of conflating immigration and insecurity. That is why I think it is highly desirable to create a European mechanism that allows for the reintroduction of border controls in exceptional circumstances, which would help to mitigate the shortcomings of certain Member States in controlling their external borders when placed under intense migratory pressures.</p>

Given the recent pressures on the system due to significant movements of people from many North African countries, we agree with the option of temporarily reinstating limited internal border controls ‘in truly exceptional circumstances’. We also believe that the situation cannot be managed purely at a national level, but requires the mobilisation of all the Member States at European Union level and the use of all the operational and financial instruments the Union possesses. We acknowledge that the free movement of people across European borders is a major success, and effectively is one of the main pillars of the European Union, but we warmly recommend reinforcement of Schengen governance.

In accordance with Article 9 of the Lisbon Treaty the European Parliament and the national parliaments shall together determine the organisation and the promotion of effective and regular interparliamentary cooperation within the Union. I clearly support the view that strengthened interparliamentary cooperation in the area of CFSP and CSDP would reinforce the parliamentary influence on the political choices made by the EU and its states.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the European Parliament resolution because interparliamentary cooperation plays a key role in the new EU Treaty, with the aim of establishing proper democratic legitimacy. The contribution made by national parliaments to shaping the Common Foreign and Security Policy is particularly useful. Articles 9 and 10 stipulate the use of specialist committees as a working tool, which makes the procedure more flexible. I think that the exchange of good practices between delegations helps improve the consultation process and make it quicker to adapt to the Union’s other mechanisms. I welcome the introduction of an initiative from the conference of parliamentary bodies indicating relevant subjects for the European institutions. Establishing this form of communication with national authorities will facilitate the external policymaking process at EU level. Interparliamentary cooperation also provides a way of increasing the representation of citizens in the Union’s political processes.</p>

      <p sl="el">As far as interparliamentary CFSP/CSDP ‘scrutiny’ meetings are concerned, the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left were rejected, amendments which introduced: a) the facility for the interparliamentary meeting to issue opinions; b) its right to approve binding conclusions/resolutions, especially on military and non-military missions, without limiting the national parliaments’ existing rights of scrutiny; c) its legal right to reject or approve each CFSP action and all military and non-military missions; d) its right to receive detailed information on every CFSP/CSDP mission planned, well before the Council passes any decision to start an operation; e) its right to submit questions and receive information; and f) its right to observe CFSP/CSDP actions by visiting current missions.</p>

Almost 25 years after this initiative was launched, Germany has lodged a complaint against this mechanism, which allows social aid to be funded not through a social policy budget but through the agricultural policy budget.

      <p sl="lt">The Commission estimates that 80 million people in the EU are at risk of poverty and that, due to the financial and economic crisis and soaring food prices, an increasing number of people are being put at risk of food poverty. The scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union, set up in 1987 under the common agricultural policy, currently provides food aid for 13 million people suffering from poverty in 19 Member States and has distribution chains involving some 240 food banks and charities. The scheme has increasingly relied on market purchases as a consequence of the common agricultural policy pursued by the EU, which has led to reduced levels of intervention stocks, the traditional source of supplies for the scheme. The proposal for 2012 includes a sudden reduction in funding from EUR 500 million in 2011 to EUR 113 million in 2012, which will have a major impact on the EU’s most vulnerable citizens.

      <p sl="fr">The decision by the European Commission to drastically reduce the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union has caused an outcry on the part of charities and, more generally, a feeling of incomprehension amongst the citizens. It is, of course, due to a legal problem, following a decision by the Court of Justice, which left the Commission no alternative. However, for some years now there has been talk of making this a permanent budget. Since the matter is being blocked in the Council, the Commission should have found a solution to prevent the situation from getting this far. By adopting by a very large majority today this resolution on the future of the scheme, we are re-stating our support for this programme which, in our opinion, should retain an annual budget of approximately EUR 500 million, and our support for the Commission in its quest for a solution. It should formulate a resolution on the new legal basis as soon as possible, and should also find a transitional solution to enable the associations on the ground to continue to play a key role in combating poverty and social exclusion.</p>

The answer to the ever-increasing poverty among people in the EU cannot be to end funding, without providing for any transitional measures.

I am therefore joining with the various political groups urging the Commission to rethink its decision to cut food aid, and draw attention to the fact that such aid is increasingly necessary and important.

      <p sl="pt">Combating poverty, social exclusion and malnutrition is of vital importance to social cohesion and European integration. It is also one of the five priorities of the EU 2020 strategy. Today there are 79 million people living in poverty and around 30 million undernourished people in the EU. In this context, the EU cannot compromise a scheme which has proven itself to be of vital importance to the poorest people and which ensures that more than 440 000 tonnes of food are distributed to 18 million people. I therefore agree with this resolution, highlighting the worry of the risk of worsening rural poverty and the collapse of rural communities, as well as the importance of a healthy, high-quality diet for children, especially in view of their developmental and educational needs.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Approximately 43 million people in the EU are at risk of food poverty, and it is estimated that the economic and financial crisis and soaring food prices are putting increasing numbers of people at risk of food poverty. About 80 million people in EU countries are at risk of poverty, and the number of people affected in this way could increase further due to the financial and economic crisis. The scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union, set up in 1987 under the common agricultural policy, currently provides food aid for 13 million people suffering from poverty in 19 Member States and has distribution chains involving 240 food banks and charities. Halting an existing and functioning aid scheme abruptly without prior notice or preparation would undeniably have a major impact on the most vulnerable EU citizens. As the EU intervention stocks have been greatly reduced, we must find a solution to the current deadlock on this issue at Council level, and we must also find the most appropriate legal basis for the next financial programming period. The right to food is a fundamental human right and is achieved only when all people have physical and affordable access at all times to suitable, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and priorities for an active and healthy life.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The decision by the European Commission, on 19 June, to cut aid to the most deprived persons from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million has dropped a bombshell on the charities landscape in Europe. This decision by the Commission, which comes one year after the European Year for Combating Poverty, and against the backdrop of the EU 2020 strategy’s objective of reducing poverty and social exclusion, is utterly astonishing. Furthermore, the fact that no mechanism has been introduced to replace it is even more astonishing, especially given that we are in a time of crisis. Consequently, I voted in favour of the joint resolution by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left on the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. Indeed, by means of this resolution, MEPs, independent of their political allegiance, are entreating the Commission and the Council to find a transitional solution to the funding of the scheme for the period 2012-2013, in the event that it is no longer funded by the common agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I abstained from the vote, because programmes for deprived persons have to be implemented in light of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, as the Commission rightly pointed out in its statement of estimates for the budget year 2012. In its Judgment T-576/08 of 13 April 2011, the Court stated that only the supply of food from intervention stocks will be covered by this programme, not expenditure incurred by buying food supplies on the market. I believe that, as a result of the judgment, Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 983/2008 cannot be used as a legal basis for food distribution for the needy. The Commission should propose a modification of the regulation for the most deprived persons scheme in order to find a solution to the current deadlock on this issue at Council level. A legal basis should be found for the next financial programming period. I agree that the right to food is a fundamental human right and is achieved when all people, at all times, have physical and economically feasible access to suitable, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and preferences for an active and healthy life. Poor nutrition has a negative influence on health. High-quality and healthy nutrition is especially important for children and contributes towards satisfying their developmental and educational needs. At the same time, farmers need to be guaranteed a decent and fair income and remuneration for their work. The Commission should address the issue of rural poverty and the collapse of rural communities.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I call upon the Commission and the Council to find a solution to the problem of funding food parcels, since this programme secures access to food for millions of people throughout Europe. Let us bear in mind that, according to information held by the Commission, around 43 million people in the European Union are at risk of food poverty. A significant number of these people rely on food parcels prepared by the European Union. These parcels play an important part in people’s lives, enabling both adults and children to be adequately nourished. It is precisely at a time of economic crisis that we should be supporting society’s weakest and most vulnerable sector. Around 140 000 people in Latvia have received food parcels this year, but if nothing changes, the funding allocated to food parcels in 2012 will be approximately 10 times smaller than is necessary. We must not allow this to happen, for it would run contrary to European values, adherence to which has brought well-being to a large number of Europeans. One of the five priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce poverty and social exclusion. If we are unable to find a solution that preserves funding for this programme, then poverty and the numbers suffering from shortages will increase. We must not allow this to happen.</p>

It is important that we continue to make these aid programmes available and that all the existing programmes are fully exploited. However, the discussion about the pot from which the funding should come must not be held at the expense of those people who need support. The programmes in the agricultural sector are efficient and have proved their worth. One of the major challenges in future will be to make more food available for more people in the light of the growing world population.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the resolution on the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the European Union. Since 1987 the scheme for food distribution to deprived persons has been an essential tool for providing aid to parts of the population in difficulties. The scheme is financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and involves the voluntary participation of Member States, each of which is assigned an annual budget ceiling by the European Commission based on Eurostat data on poverty. The Commission also compiles a list of products to be taken from public stocks or purchased on the market, within the limits of the allocation assigned. The planned EUR 387 million cut for next year must not hit the 13 million people at risk of poverty who currently receive aid from numerous charities and food banks within the EU. Together we must find a system to make this form of aid secure and constant also in the future as part of the ongoing reforms of social and agricultural aid.</p>

We agree with the initiative of the Commission and the United Nations to take a common stand against food insecurity and malnutrition in the world. We believe that the scheme to support the most deprived members of society should be maintained and that the Commission has to identify a legal basis for the existing food scheme or for a new scheme to help the poor. The possibility of increasing the supply of products destined for the scheme must also be taken into consideration, by allowing the purchase of products withdrawn from the market through means other than intervention, such as export returns or private stocks. Finally, we feel that it is necessary that, within the context of structural fund adjustment, the Commission should guarantee that vocational qualifications and academic qualifications should be increasingly promoted, in order to allow more deprived people to participate in the social state through work.</p>

Reducing food aid from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million, especially at a time of economic and social crisis, is utterly disgraceful. Many families will be left with no food.

      <p sl="fr">2010 was the Year for Combating Poverty. While the decision by the European Court of Justice is legally correct, it cannot be justified in political terms. What we have here is a question of political ethics or moral scandal.

Is there anything more outrageous than to see this basic right flouted, while the modern world, indeed while Europe has the resources to implement it?

Following a judgment by the European Court of Justice stipulating that only the provision of food from intervention stocks is covered by this programme, and not expenditure on foodstuffs on the market, the Commission is planning to cut funding drastically: it is set to fall from EUR 500 million in 2011 to EUR 113 million in 2012.

It calls upon the Commission to present a proposal for a regulation to improve the degree of harmonisation and comparability of population data provided by the Member States.

      <p sl="cs">I believe that a single European electoral system is a good idea, but unfortunately it is too far ahead of the political and social reality. It is clear that there is currently no such thing as a European political nation which could unify to express its will in European elections, and the European political parties more closely resemble discussion forums than close-knit organisations attempting to obtain political power. In this context, the decision to elect 25 new MEPs looks like a measure artificially imposed not from below, on the basis of voters’ needs and wishes, but in line with the wishes of the Eurofederalist group, which is attempting to move the EU towards a federal state with a single political and electoral system whatever the cost. In many respects, the adopted decision stops halfway. It does not guarantee that all the Member States will be represented among the 25 pan-European MEPs, and indeed the number of Member States is greater than 25. This is instead a symbolic gesture, but such symbolic gestures have traditionally played an important role in connecting citizens to the EU, and I therefore find it surprising that the authors of the motion for a resolution have downplayed this aspect so incomprehensibly. Voters from the smaller Member States in particular will quite rightly feel that their vote counts for little.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Secondly, it is inadmissible that, once again, an attack be made on the right of the representatives of the smaller and medium-sized Member States, reducing their chances of direct representation, which will end up further distancing elected representatives from the ordinary voters, weakening democracy and contributing to an increase in abstention in the elections for Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="sk">A European Parliament directly elected by universal suffrage is a key element in the constitutional order of the European Union. During the long negotiations on treaty revision, the EU made substantial progress in establishing the basic conditions for uniform elections to the European Parliament, despite the absence of a single electoral law. Several of the problems encountered by previous rapporteurs concerning this issue have been dealt with satisfactorily. There is another category of issues that might have appeared problematic at the start of the exercise to introduce direct elections, but, with the benefit of experience, this is no longer the case. These include the eligibility of independent candidates and control of election expenses. Parliament’s importance and powers have grown substantially since 1979. The Treaty of Lisbon, which has at last entered into force, has made MEPs much more powerful. In this respect, Parliament both needs and deserves an electoral system and an internal organisation which are commensurate with its new duties. There is clearly still a significant number of important questions of electoral procedure which, if addressed effectively, would make future elections to Parliament more uniform than they have been in the past, and should bring benefits in terms of cohesion, legitimacy, efficiency and pluralism. It may well be that the time has come to look more seriously at developing a mathematical formula for the distribution of seats which will be durable, transparent and politically impartial.</p>

It is essential to restore a more dedicated approach by establishing a budget line managed by one lead directorate. The Commission, moreover, should take into account the specific needs of individual countries and acknowledges that in some areas of the world the existence of landmines has become a structural issue. I would like to underline that efforts should be concentrated on sustaining the development of greater local capacity, meant as training for local personnel on a structured and professional basis, and use of military units, specifically trained for humanitarian demining in post conflict situations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This report, which I fully support, calls in particular on the European Union to significantly increase the proportion of its funding available for victim assistance, but not at the expense of funding for mine clearance. There is also, of course, the need for the problem to be resolved structurally. We should pay particular attention to those countries that experience difficulties in resolving on their own the challenges posed by mine clearance.

This therefore continues to be a serious situation to which the international community cannot remain indifferent, especially when certain states continue to use anti-personnel landmines, as in the cases of Burma and Libya. According to information from the international community, in spite of all the efforts made, there are still more than 90 countries affected by anti-personnel landmines, Afghanistan, Colombia, Pakistan, Burma, Cambodia and Laos being the worst affected. The process of demining must be continued. The action of our US allies has been fundamental to this process, whether through funding demining or supporting victim support programmes.

This is a problem which affects victims mainly in countries with a great deal of social and economic tension. Because of the specific nature of these kinds of widespread weapons, and because the techniques and the technologies for detecting explosives have not advanced significantly, financial support for this cause must continue. Efforts to use the available resources to combat mines more efficiently must also continue, principally regarding the recognition, detection, marking and removal of anti-personnel landmines and other explosive remnants of war, such as abandoned ordnance, unexploded ordnance, cluster munition remnants and improvised explosive devices.

Mine action includes the surveying, detection, marking and clearance of anti-personnel landmines and other explosive remnants of war – including abandoned ordnance, unexploded ordnance, cluster munition remnants and improvised explosive devices. It also includes mine risk education, victim assistance, stockpile destruction and advocacy aimed at promoting the universalisation of relevant international conventions and treaties in order to put an end to the production, use of and trade in mines.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report because, despite the progress that has been made in mine action over the past decade, efforts need to be intensified if the threat is to be eliminated. To date 156 countries, including 25 EU Member States, have signed and ratified the Mine Ban Treaty and a great deal of pressure is being put on those that have yet to accede to the Treaty to do so. Another aspect on which there is still much to be done is the destruction of stockpiles of such ordnance, particularly the stockpiles in China and Russia, which currently have 100 million and 24.5 million anti-personnel mines respectively.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of this report, which tackles the issue of mine action, specifying that this term includes the detection and clearance of anti-personnel mines and explosive ordnance.</p>
      <p sl="it">The presence of mines is not only a humanitarian problem, but also an economic one, as land on which they are installed cannot be used. The report focuses in particular on prevention and education, especially for children, and on how to avoid and reduce the risks of mines exploding. Because of their age, children are less aware of the risks they run when playing on or crossing mined land. It is not acceptable that every year thousands of young innocents should die or be maimed by the explosion of unexploded bombs or mines scattered on battlefields.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Democratic Republic of Congo is something of a misnomer, as it is certainly not democratic, nor is it really a functioning republic. If it was, we could perhaps hope to see the government take action to prevent the mass rape of women and to prosecute those responsible for that heinous crime. But in reality the government has little authority over vast swathes of this anarchic country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The latest mass rapes in South Kivu province are another sorry chapter in the violent and troubled history of the DRC, which is verging on being a failed state. Those crimes were allegedly committed by former rebels who had been integrated into the national army but then deserted. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this appalling case is that the perpetrators are unlikely ever to be brought to justice. Nevertheless, that should not stop us trying, as impunity is completely unacceptable in the modern world. Having the International Criminal Court as a body of global jurisprudence for such vile crimes offers us at least some glimmer of hope for the victims of this savagery to see some justice – victims to whom we say today that we in this Parliament will not ignore what has happened to you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have to remind ourselves that we are all responsible in different ways for what is happening because UN Resolution 1325 emphasises it is the responsibility of all states to put an end to impunity and prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including those relating to sexual or other violence against women and girls.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time has come to go beyond condemnation; the Congolese Government and the UN should assume responsibility and take concrete action to end these atrocities. For the Congolese Government, for instance, it is necessary to make dealing with violence against women a national priority and put in place mechanisms such as establishing transitional justice to promote truth, requiring accountability for sexual violence; and organising a national campaign to heighten public awareness of the mass rape of women.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Commission: it is time to review the DRC’s Country Strategy Paper and the national indicative programme of the EDF (2008-2013), with the objective of making the issue of mass rape and sexual violence against women a national priority to combat impunity. The EU’s development funds to the DRC should be allocated as a matter of priority to providing medical, legal and social support for victims of sexual abuse and empowering women and girls as a way of preventing further sexual abuse.</p>

      <p sl="fr">in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in South Kivu province in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) has not been able to afford sufficient protection against these mass rapes and it is the responsibility of the government of the DRC to guarantee safety on its territory and to protect civilians. The funds allocated only reach a very few of the victims, and coordination of the aid is in no way guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is crucial for the Commission to maintain the funding that it grants to humanitarian aid in eastern DRC.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The plan favouring a military solution to resolve the conflict in South Kivu has proved to be a failure. There must be a political solution to this conflict, and we cannot but lament the international community’s lack of courage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that the media also have an essential role to play, and they do not always play it. In particular, they should ensure that people remain involved and that public opinion is properly alerted to the issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the systematic and widespread practice of rape as a war crime may amount to crimes against humanity, according to the UN. The organisation has extended its mission to the DRC but, if our conclusion is that the mandate is insufficient to effectively intervene, we must encourage its revision. The UN must also carry out an independent inquiry so that we can learn about the scope and the scale of these horrific crimes. The impunity has to end. The international community, as well as the media, have an essential role to prevent sexual violence and to raise awareness. The authorities of the DRC must prioritise the ending of violence and of sexual violence in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of taboos, victims often do not speak out and, when they do, they risk being excluded from their communities. The fact that there are so many problems in the DRC must make us more vigilant and engaged. We must never allow a situation where rape is routine and where hundreds of thousands of people, particularly women, suffer in silence. At home we demand more transparency on the use of conflict minerals. We all use ICT products that potentially contain the minerals that fuel the conflicts in the DRC.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, it is with considerable emotion, anger and, at times, fury that I note that the issue of the raped women in eastern Congo is before us again. It is not the first time, and we remain powerless in the face of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would simply like to say that I do not believe that we are powerless. We have been given a list of the decisions taken by the United Nations and the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO). A law is currently being drawn up in the Democratic Republic of Congo to introduce particular laws covering this kind of violation. It has been mentioned that what is needed, in this part of the country where the civil war is getting under way again, are political negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I must tell you that there is something that I find particularly repellent. We are talking about women whom we have visited and to whom we have listened here in this Parliament. The fact is that these women, who have been raped, do not even have the right to abortion, and, today, the children of these rapes are rejected by all communities. That, today, is a human tragedy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Do not think, ladies and gentlemen, that I am trying to put the issue of abortion back on the table in the light of these emergencies. In most current legislation prohibiting abortion, rape provides an exception to this rule; in Congo this is not yet the case, and these 100 women and the 300 more that we have met, will give birth to children that they do not love and who will become part of those children abandoned on the Congolese streets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So this is indeed a human tragedy. I would like us to consider it further in another place, at another time. It is unacceptable from all points of view.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in South Kivu is very difficult. The long-standing conflict in the area gives rise to acts of violence on a daily basis. Since the beginning of the year alone, Médicins sans Frontières has helped 500 victims of mass rapes in the region of Fizi, in South Kivu. I agree with Mrs De Keyser that it is very frustrating that the number of mass rapes committed against the civilian population is consistently increasing in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and that we have to talk about this once again. Yet we must talk about it, because sexual violence is unacceptable. We cannot remain silent on this issue. The local armed forces are not doing much to help in this situation. They are poorly trained and poorly equipped, and it is sometimes the case that the soldiers themselves are the rapists. As a result, it is incumbent upon us to provide more help to the victims. Instead of spending EUR 7 million on observing elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we should maybe consider earmarking these funds for helping victims and prosecuting sex offenders.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, crimes of sexual violence in South Kivu must be investigated and the perpetrators punished. It is essential to combat the culture of impunity in order to prevent atrocities like this from recurring. The European Union must make this issue a priority in their cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo, and must denounce and condemn the companies involved in mineral extraction which support the troops and armed militias who carry out these heinous crimes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why it is also essential for the EU to raise other serious human rights violations with the Congolese authorities, such as the recent imprisonment of Agostinho Chicaia, an activist from Cabinda, Angola, who was detained on 20 June in Kinshasa airport when travelling on United Nations business. His arrest was carried out based on a blacklist drawn up by the Angolan authorities, who claim to not have requested the arrest. This is a Kafkaesque case which demonstrates that human rights are also violated in this way in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Agostinho Chicaia must be freed immediately, and the EU should also be insisting upon this.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, once again, women are the main victims of the conflicts. In Congo, sexual violence is once again being used as a weapon of humiliation to cause the maximum destruction of the adversary. Moreover, in this case, there are clear economic interests behind a conflict in which more decisive action on trade and on certain products that we use every day, the so-called ‘conflict minerals’, would be a real tool for peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore call for greater supervision and determination in this particular respect, and I support the proposed resolution, which focuses on democracy in order to avoid violence and war. Moreover, I think it is important to remember that we should also ask more of the European institutions in terms of support for political processes, which is what always ends up resolving this kind of conflict. I hope that you all agree with me on this.</p>

The country we are talking about is one of the poorest in Africa. On the one hand there is no power there, since anarchy rules and power is on the streets, and yet on the other hand there is a great deal of power, since it is in everyone’s hands. Sometimes a representative of the authorities, a policeman or member of the armed forces, can decide over people’s lives and health. This is terrible. I would like to say that the European Parliament is dealing with this matter once again, and it is once again issuing a very dramatic appeal to the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo to provide genuine protection for their own people.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, just a few hours ago, I had an extensive telephone conversation with a Dutch aid worker in Kivu, in eastern Congo. He made it clear that he was genuinely pleased that the European Parliament, this House, is devoting its attention this morning to the acute poverty of the Congolese population, into whose well-being he is pouring his heart and soul. International attention – including the attention of this House this morning – that condemns the unpunished perpetration of atrocities and lawless violence in eastern Congo, together, for that matter, with the visible presence of the UN MONUSCO mission on the ground, has a real preventative effect and also breaks through the suffocating silence and suffering of the countless victims of mass rape.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For the rest, Commissioner, is the press report that I read yesterday that the judicial inquiry into the rape was suspended due to threats of reprisals true? That would be to send a terrible signal, especially for the victims and their families.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, unfortunately, crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of Congo go back over 150 years. The main exports of the Belgian colony were rubber, ivory and copper. The population was subjected to forced labour on the plantations and in the mines. The people who were exploiting them used very cruel methods. Delivery quotas were imposed on each village and, if these were not met, the inhabitants were punished. The punishments took the form of whippings, rape, amputations and mass executions. I believe that Europe and, in particular, colonial Europe needs to make amends for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Violence of this kind becomes a vicious circle down through the generations and simply generates more violence. Rape is used as a weapon of war to demonstrate the unlimited power which the rapists have over their victims and to humiliate and injure them. As well as destroying the souls of the women affected, it also breaks up entire families. In addition to the physical and mental effects of rape, it is also seen as shameful, particularly if the woman becomes pregnant. The ultimate consequence is that women are rejected by their families.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another factor is the inability of the Democratic Republic of Congo to prosecute members of its own armed forces for crimes against international law. In the rare cases where a woman takes legal action against her torturer, she is given no legal protection. Crimes against humanity like these must not be tolerated. We must exert massive pressure, in particular financial pressure, on the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is totally unacceptable for Europe to cast its eye over the riches in the country and then to turn a blind eye to war crimes.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I share the sentiments of those who condemn the crimes committed in the South Kivu province and the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. According to local sources, roughly 40 rapes are committed every day, with the perpetrators often being members of the army or armed groups. At the moment, there is a lack of medical, social and legal assistance for victims, while the perpetrators of the crimes remain uninvestigated and unpunished. Protection must be provided to the 170 victims and to those who can testify so that an urgent, independent and impartial inquiry can be conducted in order to punish the perpetrators of these acts of violence in June.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, sexual offences are among the most horrible types of crime, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo this type of crime is spreading like an epidemic. No measures, either national or international, are capable of stopping it. This helplessness is particularly clear, considering that United Nations peacekeepers are also unable to do anything. I agree with those colleagues who said that we need injections of cash, and the European Union must make an example, finding the funds to help crime victims and expose the perpetrators.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, this is not the first time that we have highlighted the situation in Congo, and we utterly condemn not only the atrocities committed with appalling regularity in that country, but also the passive attitude of the Congolese authorities. During the last five months, only 11 soldiers have appeared before a court, charged with rape. However, NGO reports talk about 400 000 women who have been raped in Congo during the last decade. According to the statistics, 48 women are raped every hour. This humanitarian crisis is exacerbated by impunity and the prejudices which turn rape into a taboo subject. Otherwise, victims are at risk of being excluded from their families and community. This is the case for many of the 121 women who reported that they were raped in June in South Kivu province.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission to provide funds and greater focus on setting up centres to care for the victims and on actions aimed at reintegrating them into their families and society.

However, for now, the European Union must provide financial assistance as soon as possible to combat sexual violence and to provide help to the victims of this violence. The number-one priority must be to provide suitable medical care and support so that these victims can be integrated into Congolese society. We will need to be sure that the money is actually reaching the victims and is used to provide assistance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the Subcommittee on Human Rights has twice played host to a delegation of women from East Kivu, and on both occasions the women have told us about the atrocities taking place there. They have also explained to us what they are doing to bring the criminals to justice and how they are organising the lives of women in the area. Unfortunately, the members of the delegation also told us last week, and their information was highly credible, that the EU representatives in the Democratic Republic of Congo have not been able to meet with them over the last year to find out what can be done to help them. On the contrary, we were told that existing projects are even being stopped. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to follow up on this issue and to rectify the situation. It would be appalling if small-scale projects like this which are aimed at helping victims could not be continued.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, war and unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo have brought with them widespread sexual violence. The situation is worst in the east, in the North and South Kivu region, where they are also fighting over precious natural resources. The United Nations and international peacekeepers have clearly failed to protect both women and children there.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Rape is a cruelly demoralising tool of warfare. In addition to the mental and physical violence, it aids the spread of disease, and in many cases, the victims of rape end up being rejected by their community. It is tragic if there is no possibility of an abortion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Too much time has passed in relation to how little has been done about all this. The EU and the UN need to get a grip on the situation and take real steps to investigate cases of mass rape in the Kivu region, and bring them to an end. EU funding to the Democratic Republic of Congo should have as its priority medical and legal assistance to rape victims, and should take account of the international fight against AIDS. Moreover, other breaches of human rights and the eradication of corruption should be placed higher up our agenda.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in view of the failure of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s judicial system to hold armed groups to account for their atrocities, I welcome the extension of the UN’s mandate until 30 June 2012. At the same time, however, I would like to appeal to the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo to ensure that the mandate is implemented rigorously, in order to avoid situations where rebels rape women and abuse children and whole families next door to the mission’s camp, as happened in Luvungi.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We adopt very strict resolutions and measures against injustice elsewhere in the world and deploy entire armies, yet we treat genocides in Africa more benevolently. What other name, indeed, can we give to the events in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2003, when 5.5 million people perished, which is equivalent to the entire population of my own country, Slovakia, and 2 million were forced from their homes? We, too, should contribute towards a peaceful life for women and children in this war-torn African country through the more rigorous adoption of resolutions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, war crimes such as mass rape, sex slavery or sterilisation are among the worst forms of humiliation. What is more, in Congo the victims of such crimes will be excluded from society for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is alarming that the offenders from paramilitary groups and the armed forces are mostly not punished at all. The mandate of the UN blue helmets needs to be extended for another year, but what is also necessary is for the troops of the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) to start providing genuine protection for civilians, for President Kabila to announce a policy of zero tolerance for rape and for impartial investigations into such crimes to begin.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The authorities in Congo must have a programme for the reintegration of victims into society.

However, I regard as more serious the accounts from my colleague Véronique De Keyser, who has been there and seen how much the population is suffering and the sense of terror there is, especially among women and children. This situation must stop. We, the institutions of the European Union, must firmly demand here in this Parliament that the Congolese authorities carry out all the necessary investigations and punish those who are guilty. They must also provide counselling, including medical, legal and psychological, for all victims, who must be included in a protection programme. In addition, the entire international community, particularly women’s organisations, must respond so that we can put an end to this situation in Congo.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will be very brief. These mass rapes have gone on for decades. Therefore we need to take vital action. It is vital that we support the NGOs which are bringing aid to the victims, and particularly the hospitals. However, can I please ask the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal similar to the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States, which imposes reporting requirements on conflict materials in manufacturing? That way, those who profit from such atrocities will be held accountable. The arguments are there. It is no use saying that the Member States do not want to do it: it is up to us and the Commission to lead.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members for their interest and their sensitive approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all have again been appalled by perturbing news from Kivu, where a group of armed criminals abused and raped a considerable number of women in a systematic manner. These criminals were apparently ex-Mayi-Mayi deserting the Congolese armed forces after a transient and non-conclusive integration process.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an outrageous crime, and we are all concerned. It is therefore important to clarify the facts and bring the suspects before a court. In this regard we have been informed that a prosecutor of the Democratic Republic of Congo, supported by MONUSCO, should now be in the field in order to collect legal evidence and to prepare a prosecution case. We demand that the DRC authorities address this issue as a matter of urgency and to deliver justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, indignation is not enough: I can understand this, and so we must all ask what further action needs to be taken, including by the United Nations Security Council and MONUSCO. Naturally, support for victims should be an immediate priority, and the EU is already committed to providing medical care and mitigating suffering. I can agree with you that victim support, especially healthcare, is one of the agreed priorities here, and I would like to inform you that the EU is at the forefront of these efforts through ECHO and development-funded health support actions. In addition, support for prevention, awareness-raising initiatives and political pressure is also part of the EU approach. These efforts will continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sexual violence and rape continue to be pervasive in the DRC, with more than 15 000 reported cases in 2009, according to the United Nations: 15 000 rapes. It is therefore important to address the root causes of this serious issue and to ensure that Congolese justice will not remain confined to episodic reaction. The root causes are known: they lie within the endless conflicts in the eastern territory of the Republic of Congo and the absence of the rule of law in a context where the state authority remains to be concretised. Importantly, the prevalence of sexual violence both reflects and perpetuates the subordinate status of most women throughout the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also has a very negative impact on a lot of children being born, as Ms de Keyser pointed out. To improve this situation, it is important to continue military and non-military action against the rebels. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that this type of conflict – in many cases involving groups without a real political agenda, or criminals from neighbouring countries – is difficult to address in the short term. However, it is more and more urgent that decisive steps are taken in reforming the security sector. The persistent poor condition of defence, the police and justice in the Congo greatly worsens the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union therefore urges the Congolese authorities to give renewed priority to this challenge. Failure to make substantial progress in the defence, police and justice sectors will jeopardise the sustainability of achievements made in the economic, social and political areas. In this period of elections, tackling these issues should undoubtedly be an agenda shared by all Congolese democratic forces, as the future of the whole country is at stake.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is already providing support to the security sector reform through common security and defence policy missions and the European Commission, as well as bilateral support from Member States. These actions pay particular attention to the need to combat sexual violence; for example, EUPOL has deployed a specific team of experts on sexual violence in Goma (a city in North Kivu). Support to victims also needs to be continued. The EU is ready to do more if common ground for progress is found with Member States and the Republic of Congo authorities. However, this is an area where the ultimate responsibility will always lie with the DRC itself and where the Congolese Government needs to show true leadership and determination.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ever since it gained independence, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been the scene of sustained fighting, as a result of which millions of people have died or been forced to relocate. These conflicts have plunged the country into a humanitarian disaster, and have meant that any guarantee of fundamental human rights being observed is an illusion. The people suffering most in this situation are normal citizens, who are living in constant fear for their lives and their families, and who are functioning in extreme poverty, without any work and without any schooling. The situation is most critical in the Kivu province. In spite of the ‘Act of Commitment’ signed on 23 January 2008, in which the armed groups operating in the province of South Kivu committed themselves to stopping the atrocities, it is still the case that murders, rapes, torture of the civilian population and the conscription of child soldiers are daily occurrences there. However, the crime committed most frequently by all sides in the conflict is mass rapes of women. These women are in a tragic situation. They do not receive any psychological help as a result of the dreadful state of the health service, and most of the time they are left on their own, helpless, intimidated and frequently rejected by their husbands, who regard them as disgraced. The authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo are responding sluggishly to such an enormous human tragedy, ignoring the problem and leaving the citizens of Congo without help and the perpetrators unpunished. We have to realise that the temporary stabilisation of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a façade, behind which indescribable atrocities are taking place while the world looks on.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, as a concerned Protestant I have this week heard from various missionary workers about the social situation of churches and of Christians in Indonesia. If the European Parliament is to put a country on its agenda of human rights violations, that, of course, requires careful handling of the facts on our part.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My initial conclusion from these contacts is that, among the churches, there are concerns, above all, about areas in the Indonesian archipelago with a Muslim majority. As an insider put it, using benign wording – the church is being tolerated, but that could change around very suddenly. From Java, in particular, the noises that are being heard are sombre – the authorities provide resistance to the building of churches and there is intimidation by small radical Muslim groups. To support this I quote a church leader from Bekasi, West Java, who said, ‘Despite a court judgment that we can use our church to hold services, the mayor is prohibiting us from doing so. We therefore now hold our services on the street, where we also baptise our children and celebrate the sacraments. It is a dangerous and undesirable situation. The radicals want to get us to surrender this way. This may go on for some time. Local Muslims who supported our church are also threatened by radical Islamists. We need the support of the international community. There should be freedom of religion for everyone.’</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe’s institutions must put across this urgent message when they talk to the Indonesian authorities – in a balanced way, of course. We are not talking of general persecution of Christians in Indonesia, my local sources tell me, and they are grateful for the prevailing religious freedom. It is also true, however, that ‘all over the country an Arabification of Islam can be perceived, and this, naturally enough, is greatly worrying for Christians’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We surely must share these worries, and we need to pass them on to Jakarta.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, at a recent meeting in Jakarta, the representative of an Indonesian human rights organisation declared that ‘we currently have complete religious freedom in Indonesia. We are free to practise the religion that we wish, provided that it is not the Ahmadi religion.’ There is some exaggeration in these statements as we know that other minorities are also at risk in Indonesia. However, this exaggeration is understandable since we are still suffering from the shock of the Cikeusik massacre, in which three followers of the Ahmadi religion were killed. This is a religion that considers itself Muslim but which certain fanatics do not want to be considered as such.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Here we have a serious problem: we know that the majority of Indonesians want peace and tolerance between religions and it is in the light of this that they interpret the national principles of the Pancasila. However, we also know that there is a minority who claim to speak for the whole of society, and this poses a serious challenge for the authorities. Firstly, they cannot allow a minority of fanatics to speak on behalf of society as a whole; and secondly, the government must express its abhorrence at these attempts. In that respect, I find it very worrying that certain statements made by the Minister of Religious Affairs of Indonesia have indicated that the Ahmadi religion cannot class itself as Muslim.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that, if the Indonesian Government does not want the wishes of these fanatics to contaminate the rest of society, it has to be very clear in its efforts to combat intolerance. That is what we, in Parliament, are asking of the Indonesian authorities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the ongoing democratisation of Indonesian society fills us with enormous admiration, but it also means that our expectations are greater. Numerous instances of discrimination on the grounds of religion are casting a shadow over the country’s image, obscuring the goals and achievements of the current holder of the ASEAN presidency. Over 15% of the citizens of Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim state, belong to a religious minority.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The fact that Indonesia has become the scene of bloody anti-Christian repressions is therefore outrageous. Although civil society, religious leaders and representatives of moderate Islam have categorically condemned the attacks on religious minorities, we are still witnessing events involving death and destruction. Reports of the lack of involvement and ineptitude of the authorities and the police in preventing the violence are a particular cause for concern. The legitimacy of the restrictive law allowing harsh sentences to be imposed for blasphemy and heresy has also been criticised by the Muslim community, and it has become a convenient tool for discrimination and misuse. In the name of respect for human rights, I am calling on the Indonesian authorities to take immediate steps aimed at guaranteeing their citizens’ safety and fundamental freedoms, in the spirit of cooperation with the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Indonesia, as is well known, is an important partner for the European Union in the Muslim world. It must be mentioned that progress has been made in this country, in recent years, in terms of democracy and the protection of human rights. We only need to recall, for example, the ratification of some important international instruments. However, the situation for minorities, especially religious minorities, whether Ahmadi, Christian or Buddhist, has deteriorated significantly. The multitude of laws restricting the rights of religious minorities and of increasingly violent attacks against them is proof that intolerance is spreading in Indonesia. The authorities in Jakarta ought to devise a clear strategy for ensuring respect for religious freedom and promoting tolerance. Another definite requirement is for discriminatory legislation to be abolished and for those found guilty of violence to be punished. I think that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement we have with Indonesia provides a special framework for tackling the situation on religious freedom and minorities.</p>

In a country that genuinely adheres to the rule of law, where human rights are actually respected, there is room for minorities without mandatory laws, whether it concerns religious, linguistic or ethnic minorities.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the overwhelming majority of the European Union’s population is Christian. The early foundation of the Member States participating in EU integration is inseparable from Christian culture; yet we must speak out against the attacks against Christians in Indonesia, or any other part of the world, primarily because European States have undertaken to guarantee a high level of protection of basic human rights, and want to uphold this principle in their dealings with their important commercial partners as well. At the same time, this brave stand presupposes that EU Member States also respect the rights of minorities living in their own territories, recognising the special status of indigenous national minorities. As the country with the world’s largest Muslim population, Indonesia bears a special responsibility concerning the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities living in its territory. The European Union has a similarly tremendous responsibility with respect to its attitude towards its own minorities and increased attention to their problems.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is totally unacceptable for the state, through its Minister of Religious Affairs and its police, to sanction such violence in a country which is, moreover, undergoing rapid economic development and which plans to play an increasing role on the international stage.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Indonesia is a beautiful country with deep traditions of pluralism, cultural harmony, religious freedom and social justice, but regrettably we are seeing an increase in extremist attacks against religious minorities, including against the Ahmadis, who consider themselves Muslim but who are not recognised as such by everyone. We see attacks on Christians, Buddhists and against progressive civil society organisations. On video clips placed on the Internet we have seen well-documented human rights violations when an angry mob set fire to churches, killing a number of people.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important that the rule of law be upheld and that the perpetrators are held accountable, including when they belong to the security forces. The abusive blasphemy and religious defamation laws must end. Initiatives by civil society organisations, as well as the government and the judiciary, are welcome steps. Political support for the protection of pluralism is important, and the progress on the implementation of democracy and the rule of law in recent years should be deepened and strengthened. We encourage the Government of Indonesia to take up recommendations made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and to invite the UN Special Rapporteur for freedom and religion and belief to visit the country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the attacks on members of the Ahmadi Christian community in Indonesia are symptomatic of a worrying trend in many Muslim societies, even those like Indonesia that are considered relatively enlightened under their system of Pancasila. Ahmadis, who, having been expelled from Pakistan now happen to have their global headquarters in London, my constituency, are considered apostates by mainstream Sunni Islam. The penalty for apostasy under Sharia is the death penalty. Thankfully Indonesia, whose functioning democracy has made great strides in recent years, does not widely practise Sharia law accept in Aceh.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the government needs to do more to promote tolerance and protect religious freedom across this vast and geographically fragmented country. In particular Indonesia’s political leaders should no longer turn a blind eye to those who seek to sow hatred and violence through exacerbated religious tensions and differences, and they must criminally prosecute all those who are carrying out such atrocities against minorities. As well as lifting the ban on Ahmadis, the government should revise all decrees and the blasphemy laws, which are used effectively to prevent Christians and others from building new places of worship. We in Europe expect such high standards of Indonesia precisely because it is a pluralist democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the situation surrounding Indonesia’s religious minorities calls for our urgent attention. People have been arrested, tortured and killed. The number is growing, and something needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The attacks are contrary to Indonesia’s tradition of pluralism and a respect for cultural harmony. Those who have come under attack have included Christians, Buddhists and the Ahmadis, who regard themselves as Muslim. As an example, I could mention the events of 8 February, when hundreds of people set fire to three churches and attacked a priest in a city in Java. The reason for the attack was that, in their view, a Christian who had insulted Islam had received a sentence of only five years in prison, instead of the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Over the past six years, there have been 430 attacks on Christian churches. There are many examples from all the religious minorities, and breaches of human rights are becoming more serious from one to the next.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the fact that the authorities of the world’s largest Muslim state cannot manage to control the ever stronger radical strain of Islam, the aim of which is to destroy Christianity and to limit its influence, is a very serious situation. Of course, we could say that this forms part of a wider pattern of persecution of Christians, since a Christian is killed every few minutes somewhere in the world. Yet let us be quite frank about the fact that it is not only the Christian minority which is being persecuted in Indonesia. We could even say that Indonesia, with its occupation of East Timor, has seen the slaughter of Christians fighting for the independence of their own state before during its history, but this is a different situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union’s response to this matter should undoubtedly be very forceful, since a failure to act by Europe is unfortunately a sin of omission, speaking in theological terms.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, following the tragic reports from Indonesia, I should like to express my deep concern at the situation. Indonesian citizens cannot feel safe in their own country, in spite of the rights and freedoms they are theoretically guaranteed. Attacks on and persecution of religious and other minorities are not one-off incidents, but widespread. Yet Indonesia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 2006, which guarantees fundamental civil and political rights, including the protection of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. Chapter 29 of the Indonesian Constitution also guarantees religious freedom to its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Public opinion in Europe has been shocked and alarmed by these manifestations of aggression and discrimination against religious minorities, mainly but not exclusively Christian minorities. What is needed is for the public authorities to respond decisively to the actions of extremist groups terrorising religious minorities, and we, as the European Union, should demand that such measures are taken.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to echo the fears expressed by previous speakers regarding the fate of minority groups in Indonesia, which are suffering violence and discrimination due to their religious or cultural affiliation. After all, Indonesia is a country with a long tradition of pluralism and civil society, which previously served as a model of high standards for many countries in the region and further away. The fact that Indonesia has ratified the fundamental human rights conventions, and its election as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, are highly valued achievements in Europe and throughout the world. I am therefore surprised that Indonesia, which is a modern and progressive country, is failing to notice or respond to repeated incidents of violence against religious minorities such as the Ahmadis, Christians, Buddhists and Baha’is, which should be guaranteed freedom of speech and religion. I believe that the international community as a whole, and in particular the European Union, should strongly oppose the lack of respect for freedom of conscience in Indonesia.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the recent tensions in Indonesia contradict the notion of a multicultural society, which has been promoted lately by the authorities. I want to draw attention to the rise in the number of attacks against religious minorities, especially the Ahmadi and Christian communities. It is the Indonesian authorities’ duty to adopt the measures required to protect their citizens, irrespective of their religion or point of view. These include carrying out investigations and providing suitable punishment for acts of violence, including those perpetrated on 6 February 2011, not to mention combating displays of intolerance. I appeal to the government in Jakarta to focus on these aspects as a priority. Civil society also has an important role to play in restoring social cohesion at the moment. For its part, the EU can make a specific contribution to promoting an increased level of protection for human rights through dialogue and cooperation with the Indonesian authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is important to remember that Indonesia is a very good friend of the European Union and has made great strides in democracy. I was the chairman of the observer group that monitored the Indonesian elections over a period of time, and I have to commend them for their achievements recently.</p>
      <p sl="en">I chaired an inter-faith conference in the European Parliament that was sponsored by the Indonesian Government. It is therefore very regrettable and unfortunate that they do not seem to have acted fast enough in dealing with this intolerant behaviour by some of their people. They need to recognise that what we are saying in this Parliament we are saying as friends: we need to be in partnership with Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim democracy, to strengthen the democracy institutions of Indonesia. So I stress – because this debate will be on the front pages of the Indonesian newspapers – that we are talking as friends to strengthen the democratic arm of the Indonesian institutions and state.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Members have given a very good overview of the situation in Indonesia, and no doubt Indonesia has made rapid progress in recent years, with growing economic power, and will be looking forward to having a more comprehensive economic partnership agreement with the European Union. All that makes sense, but concomitant with that, there has to be recognition of human rights and particularly the rights of religious minorities, not just in theory but in practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legislation that is used to discriminate against religious minorities must be revoked and those who engage in these activities must be brought to justice, otherwise the problems will continue and the fanatics will have their way.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world, while also being an established democracy. Unfortunately, there have been acts of violence committed in recent years against religious minorities, as there have been in an ever-growing number of regions in the world. Religious fundamentalism is on the rise and Indonesia is one of the countries affected by this scourge. The resolution refers to a series of acts of discrimination committed against several minorities, which cause tensions between different communities, making them victims of religious intolerance. There have also been reports of extreme cases involving enforcement of Sharia law, which contravenes Indonesian legislation. I believe that closer cooperation is required with the Indonesian Government to promote greater respect for the rights of all minorities in that country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Vice-President/High Representative shares Parliament’s concerns about discrimination against religious minorities, in particular the Ahmadi and Christian communities. She also shares the concerns about the impact of introduction of Sharia-based laws on human rights, in particular the rights of women.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would, though, like to underline that we have good long-standing relations with Indonesia, with whom we signed the first partnership and cooperation agreement in Asia. The EU has raised the matter of violence against religious minorities through established channels. We have made it clear to Indonesia that this problem has to be tackled seriously, based on respect and protection of beliefs, without discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the attacks last February against the Ahmadiyyah, the European Union issued a statement expressing strong concern, and emphasising the need for an effective response by the government. The EU Delegation in Jakarta met with representatives of the Ahmadi community.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU also raised this issue in the official human rights dialogue that we established with Indonesia in 2010, at the meeting which took place in March in Brussels. We emphasised the government’s obligation to protect all religious communities and stressed that the police should be trained, including on human rights, to respond to threats and violence against religious minorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are delivering practical assistance in these areas. Since 2002, the EU has funded, for an amount of EUR 750 000, eight projects carried out by civil society organisations. These projects are aimed at enhancing tolerance and peace and promoting pluralism and multiculturalism.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also working with the Indonesian Government to foster inter-faith dialogue. Last year we organised together a seminar on Islam and a globalising world, which brought together NGOs, government representatives, European academics and Islamic religious scholars. Looking ahead, we are preparing a major conference with EU and Indonesian civil society in Jakarta this October, on freedom of religion and protection of minorities. Its recommendations will be fed into the next session of the human rights dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We follow closely developments concerning the implementation of Sharia-based laws, in particular in the province of Aceh. We raised this question in the human rights dialogue last March. The Indonesian Government informed us that Aceh has agreed to abide by international obligations and is in dialogue with local authorities and civil society to harmonise local by-laws with human right standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to mention the case of the torture of Papuan prisoners and the lenient sentences imposed on the soldiers convicted by a military tribunal in relation to recent cases. We discussed this issue in the human rights dialogue and underscored the need for dissuasive punishment for those who commit torture. The Indonesian Government is committed to ratifying the Optional Protocol of the Convention Against Torture and is pursuing initiatives to build better community relations in Papua.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to conclude by mentioning that we are also supporting Indonesia in addressing the underlying causes of religious violence, such as the spread of Islamic extremism in schools and in society generally. In this regard, we plan to fund a cooperation programme with Indonesia aimed at deradicalisation in the context of the fight against terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Violence against the Ahmadis (who consider themselves Muslims) and other religious minorities – such as Christians, Bahá'ís and Buddhists – as well as progressive civil society organisations has increased in Indonesia. The government is lagging far behind in addressing the underlying causes. Investigations have not revealed who was behind the attacks against Ahmadis in February 2011. Two weeks ago, a 22-year-old female Pentecostal pastor was abducted by three Islamic radicals. Islamic extremism has spread in schools and other public areas. Combating discrimination and securing the human rights of all, including minorities, should be a prerequisite for good relations between the EU and Indonesia. I urge the Indonesian authorities to take effective action to protect the life and personal integrity of all members of religious minorities. I call for the Commission to include a binding human rights clause in the Comprehensive Economic Partnership, insist on a moratorium on the application of blasphemy laws, and persuade the Indonesian government to repeal a 2008 ban on Ahmadi Muslim teachings, which encourages such attacks and infringes upon the freedom of religion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty is the most cruel, most inhumane and most degrading penalty, and is a violation of the right to life, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Davinder Pal Singh is in danger of being executed imminently in New Delhi, in India, as the President of India rejected his plea for clemency in May, and it should be noted that this is the second appeal rejected in the course of that month.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why this resolution sends a strong signal from the European Parliament. The European Parliament must condemn all executions, no matter where they take place. The European Parliament must encourage the European Union and its Member States to ensure that the United Nations resolution calling for a universal moratorium on executions is applied. The aim of this resolution is to achieve complete abolition in all those states that still apply capital punishment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have contributed to this resolution. I shall simply mention in closing that I have tabled two amendments, because I would like to remind you that Davinder Pal Singh had already applied for political asylum in Germany, but he was forcibly deported to India, where he was arrested on his arrival in New Delhi in January 1995. Nevertheless, two years later, the Court in Frankfurt declared his expulsion to be illegal. He should therefore never have been deported to India, where his life was under threat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, there is a wide range of evidence to suggest that Davinder Pal Singh did not receive a fair trial. That is the subject of the second amendment to be voted on. I would like to thank my fellow Members, and I hope that the entire resolution and the two amendments will be adopted.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, an article published in the international press on 13 June reported that the Indian state of Assam does not have an executioner available to carry out the death penalty which has been passed on Mahendra Nath Das, who has had his plea for pardon rejected by the country’s president. Davinder Pal Singh has also been condemned to death and had his plea for pardon rejected. We would like a partner as important to the European Union as India to respect the moratorium called for by the UN General Assembly and not to execute the two persons mentioned. Fortunately, as is already known, India has not applied the death penalty since 2007. However, we would be pleased if, just like the European Union, India would consider abolishing the death penalty as a contribution to enhancing human dignity. The fact that no one can be found who is willing to carry out the death penalty is perhaps a sign that the time has come for India to ban this punishment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the ECR has no collective view on the death penalty for murder, leaving it to MEPs to decide individually according to their own conscience. India, as a democratic country, reserves the right to impose death sentences on those convicted of the most heinous capital crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in the ECR agree that the EU has a right to request clarification of the controversial circumstances of the arrest, police custody and apparent confession made by Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, including the issue of his deportation from Germany and the fact the conviction was based on a majority decision, leaving some doubt as to whether the conviction is totally safe.</p>
      <p sl="en">India is a democracy with an independent judiciary and by and large has an adequate appellate process. It is also important to note that Mr Singh Bhullar is allegedly linked to the Khalistan Liberation Force, which is committed to carving out an independent Sikh state in India by armed force. In the past its followers have allegedly committed many terrorist atrocities and assassinations of high-level political targets. The EU’s position on the death penalty is of course well known in India. However, we also need to understand the enormous internal security pressures facing India, not only from the Khalistan armed movement but from the Naxalite insurgency and more generally from Jihadi terrorism emulating from extremists in Pakistan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when speaking of the death penalty, two large countries normally spring to mind: China and the United States of America. Judicial executions are cruelly common in each, although thankfully increasingly uncommon elsewhere. In India, with whose people Europeans share many values, the Supreme Court ruled nearly 30 years ago that the death penalty should be imposed only in the rarest of rare cases; in fact it has been used only once in the past 15 years and that was seven years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore deeply disturbing that decisions have been taken to execute the two convicts Davinder Pal Singh and Mahendra Nath Das, especially at a time when moves in the United Nations for a moratorium on the death penalty gain more support every year. It seems likely that both men’s alleged confessions were extracted under duress and therefore should not be relied on. Mr Pal Singh’s was made without access to a lawyer and was later retracted. Judicial execution, which is a cruel, inhumane and degrading penalty, allows no room for later access to justice should the convicted felons one day be found to be innocent.</p>
      <p sl="en">This House therefore appeals to the people and the President of India, in the name of humanity and of our common commitment to human progress, to commute those sentences.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, if we believe that India is a democratic country in which the suspect Davinder Pal Singh was given the right to a fair trial, then the circumstances in which the Indian court found the accused guilty of his crimes are not up for debate. The problem is the fact that he has been sentenced to a death penalty, which has been a topic of dispute and debate between countries throughout the world for many years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The death penalty has been abolished in the European Union Member States, which regard it as incompatible with the values of universal rights and human dignity. The EU also constantly endeavours to achieve the universal abolition of the death penalty, in line with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 2007, 2008 and 2010, which explicitly call on all countries still using the death penalty to take steps to abandon this practice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of the convict Davinder Pal Singh, all that we can do as Europeans is to try to call on India, as a sovereign and democratic state and a key strategic partner for the EU, to refrain from enforcing the death penalty on this convict and on others in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, less than one month ago, India announced its candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council. This country has therefore stated its intention to observe standards in the field of promoting and protecting human rights. Unfortunately, the practices of the Indian courts do not meet UN standards. Despite the fact that a moratorium on the enforcement of death penalties has been in place for seven years, and no executions have been carried out since 2004, the courts continue to hand down death sentences. According to an Amnesty International report, in the vast majority of cases these sentences have been handed down to individuals who were unable to obtain proper representation or defence during their trials. I would therefore call for the right to a fair trial to be observed. In the situation as it stands in India, the death penalty should be replaced by life imprisonment. The authorities and judicial bodies should carry out the necessary reforms as soon as possible.</p>

India has undertaken to comply with the highest standards in terms of promoting and protecting human rights.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the death penalty is particularly cruel and inhumane. It does not deter criminals, but instead leads to the further brutalisation of society. This also applies to Davinder Pal Singh and Mahendra Nath Das in India, despite the fact that their individual crimes are particularly reprehensible. Therefore, we are calling on the Indian Government to commute the death sentence in these cases to imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="de">The past history of Professor Singh, who applied for asylum in Germany and was rejected, also gives us cause for thought. Despite public protests in Germany which highlighted the possibility of Professor Singh being executed in India, he was deported in 1995 and arrested as soon as he reached Delhi. The German authorities arbitrarily disregarded the fact that it is against the law to deport someone who is threatened by torture and the death penalty. The authorities’ actions were illegal and this was confirmed by a court in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it is important for us and for the decision-makers in the European authorities to take the protection of human rights seriously. This applies to deportation policy and to arms export policy, which in Germany, as elsewhere, should be determined on the basis of the human rights situation in the destination country. However, we have just heard that Germany has once again ridden roughshod over this principle by planning to export tanks to Saudi Arabia. This bears no resemblance whatever to a policy with a focus on human rights.</p>

India’s President, Pratibha Patil, did not grant either of the convicted men an amnesty at the end of May.</p>

As a matter of principle, the death penalty is not an option in our world, in our system of values. India has also imposed a moratorium on applying the death penalty. This was a significant gesture. The aim of this European Parliament resolution is to urge India’s institutions to abide by the moratorium and, in this instance, by the various UN resolutions on this matter as well.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, frankly speaking, I was convinced that we in this House all agreed that the death penalty is the ultimate denial of human rights. I am most astonished by some of our colleagues since, in my mind, the death penalty must be opposed in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. That is the standard for which I am struggling, as, I hope, are many of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a Member of the European Parliament, and also on behalf of Amnesty International Poland, together with many others here I call once again upon the Government of India not to carry out the execution of Davinder Pal Singh. He should immediately be retried in proceedings that are in compliance with international standards on fair trials, without recourse to the death penalty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we can of course talk about India, a country where the death penalty has not been carried out for seven years. We can also talk about the death penalty as such, and earn applause for doing so. Yet perhaps we should be pointing the finger at ourselves. Let us turn our thoughts to the responsibility borne by one of the European Union’s Member States, which sends refugees back to a probable or certain death. I have the impression that this may not be a popular topic of conversation, but maybe we should examine Europe’s own conscience. Is this really the proper course of action?</p>

      <p sl="en">(replying to Róża Gräfin von Thun und Hohenstein under Rule 149(8) (blue-card questions)). – Madam President, a reference was made to my speech in which I said the ECR Group has no collective view on the death penalty for murder. That is a statement of fact. We always have a free vote in my group for these matters. I would like to make the point that Parliament is supposed to reflect the views of the population we represent and, whether you like it or not, a very large number of citizens of the European Union still agree with the death penalty for the most heinous capital crimes. I am afraid that is a fact, so I think it is perfectly reasonable that some Members do believe in the death penalty for murder.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we all share the deep concern of the European Parliament about the possibility that India may soon break its de facto moratorium, in place since 2004, on the application of the death penalty in the cases of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, and Mahendra Nath Das.</p>
      <p sl="en">Vice-President/High Representative Ashton has been in regular correspondence with a number of Members of the European Parliament regarding the death penalty in India, and she is well aware of the circumstances surrounding this case, which has been discussed with the Indian authorities in the past in the context of the death penalty issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Vice-President/High Representative wrote to India’s Home Minister Chidambaram on 1 June, immediately after President Patil rejected the mercy petitions of Mr Bhullar and Mr Das. In that letter, she made a humanitarian appeal on their behalf, as well as regarding Mr Surinder Kohli, who has also appealed for mercy to the President after his death warrant was issued in early May. She urged Minister Chidambaram to commute their sentences to life imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances, regardless of the crimes committed. This is absolutely clear. The EU’s view is that capital punishment does not serve as an effective deterrent to criminal behaviour, whereas its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Vice-President/High Representative pleaded for India to join the global moratorium that the EU aims to establish, in line with the global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty. At present, last minute appeals on health grounds are being considered by the courts, in both cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">We hope that the strong domestic and international pressure currently being exerted on the Indian authorities will result in the executions not taking place, and in the moratorium being preserved. We stand ready to consider further urgent action in case the executions become imminent, and will continue to keep the European Parliament and its Members informed of further developments. I thank you all for your interest and for your support in this common cause.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I lived in Indonesia and I love Indonesia. I know well the extraordinary progress that Indonesia has made since the first free elections in 1999 in practising democracy and respect for human rights and civic and political freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that in Europe we must appreciate – and I think we do in this resolution – how society in Indonesia, now the third largest democracy and the largest Muslim nation in the world, has firmly engraved in its fabric the values of diversity, pluralism, and tolerance, be it ethnic, linguistic, religious or political. It is that which makes Indonesia strong and appealing and inspiring throughout the world. I would say like Europe, the Europe that I want.</p>
      <p sl="en">But in Indonesia, as in Europe, we see that extremists and fanatics are sowing bigotry, hatred and intolerance. This is shown in crimes like the ones against Ahmadiyya followers or people in Papua. In Indonesia some of these extremists may be used by terrorist organisations or incite people to undermine the democratic system.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one more reason why these extremists must be combated politically and ideologically and their crimes must receive exemplary punishment. I hope that the people in the Indonesian Government will read this resolution as an expression of concern for the victims and as a genuine expression of solidarity and encouragement for all those brave people in Indonesian civil society – in government, in parliament, in the judiciary and in the media – that are fighting against these criminals and for the end of their impunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to recall a good friend who has been doing just that: Suciwati, the widow of the great human rights campaigner Munir who was murdered a couple of years ago. The perpetrators of his murder have not yet been fully brought to justice.</p>
