      <p sl="en">Madam President, elections to the European Parliament are always a highly significant moment for the Union and the 2014 elections come at a particularly critical time. The Commission has always supported every effort to reinforce Parliament’s legitimacy. This is not only in the interest of all EU institutions, but above all in the interest of EU citizens. The direct representation brings a crucial element of legitimacy for the actions of the EU. What we need today more than ever are pan-European debates, a better understanding of what is at stake, higher voter turnout and also a more direct link between the election result and the leadership of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">In his State of the Union address in September, Commission President Barroso called on European political parties to present their candidates for the post of Commission President at the European Parliament elections in 2014. A commitment from the political parties to take this step would further reinforce the European dimension of these elections. This can be done without a Treaty change, as the Treaty says that the European Council, when proposing a candidate for Commission President to the European Parliament, must take the elections to the European Parliament into account. This is therefore something which should be put into practice with immediate effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning gender balance, you know that the Commission actively promotes gender equality; however, you address your call for gender balance in the next College to the future Commission President, therefore you will certainly understand that it is not for this Commission to discuss the future President’s actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the precise dates of the European elections in 2014, it would be unfortunate if they negatively affected the turnout. If the Council adopts a decision proposing a different date for the European Parliament’s elections, the Council and Parliament, which has to be consulted in line with the amended Electoral Act of 1976, should ensure that clarity about the date is provided as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The need for a stronger political Union with more accountability and democratic legitimacy of decisions taken at European level is and must remain at the centre of all debates on the future of the EU. The role of this Parliament is of crucial importance in this context.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution that we will vote on contains three points, as the Commissioner has underlined. The first deals with bringing forward the date of the elections: the proposal is aimed at ensuring that the Commission will be in a position to start work at the end of the summer. We must verify whether this is feasible – as the Commissioner has pointed out – to ensure that the date chosen will affect turnout positively rather than negatively.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the most important proposal, however, is for nominations by the political parties of candidates for the Commission Presidency, and I prefer to speak of ‘political parties’ here rather than ‘political families’, precisely in order to underline the need for the creation of genuine European political parties. This is very important if Europe is to capture the imagination of the European electorate. The declining turnout is due also to the fact that during the European elections various national rather than European matters are discussed. The European elections are seen as nothing more than a test of the domestic political situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">During the election campaign we must talk about Europe, and the citizens must be firmly convinced that their votes count for something in terms of European policies. I think that nominating candidates for the Commission Presidency would help to convince the citizens of this. Europe will certainly be discussed more than in the past in these upcoming elections, because the economic crisis has focused attention on the basic debate of whether there should be more Europe, less Europe or even an end to Europe. It is absolutely essential to give citizens the opportunity to choose the government of Europe and the President of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">The third question has to do with the make-up of the Commission, apart from the question of gender balance: we are debating whether it might not be better for a quota of future Commissioners, established in numerical terms or in some less determined manner, to be drawn from among MEPs. This would also give the electorate the feeling that their vote makes a difference. For these reasons, I think that we should support the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis is not just an economic crisis, it is also a political crisis that has to do with the contradiction between the prevalence of the national political sphere and the need for the euro to have a European government founded on European institutions that have democratic legitimacy at European level. For this reason, the resolution is of great importance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the political party is clearly the missing link of our transnational democracy. I think if we are going to reverse the declining trend in turnout, we need to convert our European political parties into serious campaigning organisations willing to articulate an ideology to make political choices and to win votes.</p>
      <p sl="de">This motion starts that process by calling on our political families to step forward and take responsibility for building the democratic polity of our more federal Union. The nomination of party champions as candidates for the Commission Presidency, as well as the drawing of Members of the College from the Parliament, follows the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon, whereby Parliament will elect Mr Barroso’s successor. Our success will be measured in just how the personalisation and dramatisation of the election campaign captures the public imagination, fuelling debate about serious questions in front of the next Parliament, such as the character, gender balance and strength of the Commission; the pace and depth of integration; the size and shape of the budget; and of course the size of Union membership. The year 2014 is our chance to transform European democracy and this Parliament ought to seize that with confidence and strength.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is not a random structure. Europe is a democracy. Our aspiration is to make Europe one of the world’s strongest democracies, and the principle which lies at the heart of every democracy is that all power emanates from the people. Every polity needs strong institutions and strong decision-making, but what matters is that these should be based on the will of the people and how this is achieved. The more successful this is, the stronger the democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our task today is to ensure that the European elections play a stronger role in deciding Europe’s political future. It is about strengthening the connection between the choice of the voters and the policies adopted and implemented at European level in the years thereafter, and making this connection more visible to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">My question – and it relates to one specific person – is this. Where did this Mr Barroso come from? He was conjured out of the hat after the election, but had never previously been nominated as a candidate for the European Commission. Is this a case where we can say to citizens: ‘We set out the policies very clearly and it was your choice, your decision’? The answer to that is no. Citizens have the sense that they are casting their votes but have no influence over what happens afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to strengthen this connection. At the same time, we must also make it clear that political parties and families have a responsibility to make the European elections genuinely European, instead of misusing them as a means of promoting their own purely national political agendas. They must put up European candidates with European programmes. That is what we are seeking to achieve with this motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">In future, we want the political families, in advance of the elections, to state which candidate they are nominating for the post of Commission President, the most powerful position in our common Europe. To that end, we want them to meet and present their programmes and put a face to their political visions for a common Europe during the elections. All this will help to reinforce legitimacy as well as strengthen political debate about the various positions in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want the future Commission President then to be appointed from these lead candidates on the basis of the election results: in other words, he or she should come from the political family that performed best in the elections. We also want at least 50 % of the Commission, in future, to be composed of Members of this House, and we are also calling for a number of other measures to enhance citizens’ influence over the composition of the Commission and therefore also on European policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, may I thank Mr Cassini and my fellow committee members for their work on this resolution, which contains several good suggestions. We all agree that we need to improve the procedures of the next European elections. We should try to encourage greater participation in these elections by our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the change suggested to bring forward the elections from June to May 2014. This will allow Parliament more time to scrutinise the new Commission President. In the United Kingdom, holding the election in May will make it easier to tie in the European elections with our local elections. This will save the taxpayer money and should increase participation. I was pleased that the paragraph which called for at least half of the Commissioners to be drawn from Members of the European Parliament was removed in committee. We should not restrict the right of Member States to choose whom they wish to be their Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the new Commission contains both men and women of real talent. They should be appointed on merit, and merit alone. I do not support the demand in this report that the European political parties nominate a candidate for the Presidency of the Commission who should lead the campaign. The Member States in Council will choose the new Commission President. I ask Members here this question: if centre-right parties form a majority in Council in 2014, do you really think that they will appoint a socialist – perhaps like Martin Schulz – to be the Commission President, just because socialist parties hold more votes than EPP parties in the European elections? In my view, that is not going to happen. For that reason, my Group cannot support this resolution.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017-000" speaker_id="37676" name="Søren Bo Søndergaard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="da">Madam President, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left support the call for an end to the scandalous gender composition of the Commission in the next period. If all of the EU’s words about equality are to be taken seriously, this must be reflected in a balanced gender composition.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, it also seems to me that the most positive thing has been said about the motion for a resolution that we are discussing. Take, for example, the proposal that the European political parties should nominate the candidate for the post of Commission President. The question is: Where does the idea come from? Is it something that will be raised with the EU citizens? Is it something that appears on the banners carried by demonstrators in Athens, Madrid and Lisbon? No. It is a proposal that comes from above. We have heard this from Mr Barroso, among others, who turned it into a big number in his speech on the State of the Union here in Parliament. However, real democracy and the development of democracy come from below, and if the European parties want to put candidates forward for the post of Commission President, they can simply do it. It is entirely possible. They have the opportunity, regardless of whether Mr Barroso thinks so or not. The problem of the enormous democratic deficit in the EU will not be solved by making the European political debate presidential and personal.</p>
      <p sl="da">Instead, we need more democracy. Our group has therefore proposed calling on Member States to introduce electoral systems that ensure that political parties will be represented in relation to their size. What sort of democracy excludes parts of the population from being represented politically? We say, as the rebels did in the American War of Independence, ‘No taxation without representation’.</p>
      <p sl="da">Unfortunately, this motion for a resolution does not reflect this sort of clear democratic requirement. This is frustrating because – as has been said – the EU does not need more presidents, it needs more democracy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I said that the crisis currently affecting the euro is not exclusively economic but is rather a political crisis based on the growing contradiction between the fact that the national dimension prevails in politics yet the policies needed to face the crisis are European.</p>
      <p sl="it">This resolution aims to bring about a reform that does not require changes to the Treaties or secondary legislation. It is an important political and institutional reform because it uses the mechanism of nominating a candidate for Commission Presidency based on the model of parliamentary regimes, although we are obviously not dealing with a direct election. Nomination is by the European parliamentary parties, recognised by and present in the Treaties. We are therefore applying the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, which state that the President of the Commission is elected by Parliament and that the appointment of the President should take into account the result of the EP elections. At the same time, we are introducing a reform allowing the citizens to participate directly in choosing the political government of Europe. This brings genuine democratic legitimacy, based on a real European political sphere for the European institutions, which is a precondition for the effectiveness of their actions of government, as well as for their democratic legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the other hand, this reform does not, in my opinion, contradict the independence of the Commission. This is because Article 17 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the independence of the Commission refers both to the fact that the Council should propose a candidate, acting by qualified majority, and that the proposal should take account of the results of the elections to the European Parliament, clearly demonstrating, as is the case in ordinary democratic regimes, that the democratic legitimacy of a governing body does not necessarily conflict with its independence.</p>
      <p sl="it">The question here is one of democratisation and politicisation, in order to strengthen the action of the Commission and, overall, to build a more legitimate, stronger European Union that is closer to its citizens and therefore more capable of providing a response to the extraordinary crisis that we are experiencing. Indeed, with reforms such as this, the crisis might well be the opportunity to take another step on the road to a political Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, is it not deeply ironic in a debate about democracy that this Parliament is using rules to actually stifle debate? We are not allowed to use blue cards or catch-the-eye, which means that very small entities such as the non-attached Members get no speaking time at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we will all be standing in elections in 2014. You did say at the start of the debate that there would be no catch-the-eye, but you did not say, and it has not previously been put in any of the material or by e-mail, that there would be no blue cards. I think that is a real breach of this debate and shows the EU to be what it is: it talks about democracy but it does not want to let everyone have their say or even their vote.</p>

The President may, however, give the floor to Members who indicate that they wish to put a blue-card question.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as President Barroso said in his State of the Union address before this House, we need a European public space where European issues are discussed and debated from a European standpoint. We cannot continue to try to solve European problems just with national solutions and debates. The MFF is a case in point. Therefore the Commission values your engagement to enhance the European political process and to enable EU citizens to also become genuine EU political actors, be it in the context of the European elections in 2014 or beyond. The presentation by European political parties of their candidate for the post of Commission President at the European Parliament elections in 2014 would be an important step.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the choice of Commissioners, the most important aspect is that Commissioners-designate are chosen on the grounds of their competence, their European commitment and their independence. The Treaty provides a clear mechanism for the choice of Commissioners. Within this framework the European political families are always free to look for the best way to ensure the best candidatures. In any event, Parliament hears all Commissioners and must give its consent to their appointment.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many other elements that EU institutions, European political parties and Member States can use to promote the European project with our citizens. It is now for all of us to take the appropriate and sometimes bold decisions in the run-up to the elections in 2014. It is with this in mind that the Commission will come up with proposals to enhance the democratic legitimacy of our Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In 2014 the citizens of the European Union will once again be able to go to the urns and decide who they want to represent them directly in Brussels, the centre of EU affairs. Even if we have not managed to recover completely from the crisis by then, we must still concentrate our energy on giving Europe’s citizens hope for the future. I believe that it is only by adhering to democratic values that we can create a Europe that is both competitive and demonstrates solidarity. The task that falls to the political parties at European level is to promote greater European political awareness and translate the will of EU citizens into action. As this will come about at the next elections thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, I am confident that the political legitimacy of both Parliament and the Commission will be genuinely reinforced by having a more direct link between the election of these two institutions and the votes of the European electorate. It falls to Parliament to ensure that appropriate preparations are made for this process and that citizens are duly informed. The electorate needs to understand clearly why and for whom they are voting in two years’ time. They need to see the changes that have been made as regards European political cooperation, and they especially need to see how this will have a more positive impact on their own lives. I hope that the new European Parliament and European Commission will take shape in 2014 in line with Christian-democratic principles and with due consideration for European solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="it">The next item is the debate on the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors for 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to welcome the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-025-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Court of Auditors">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a great honour for me to present to this Parliament today the annual report on the implementation of the 2011 European Union budget. I will start with its main conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2011 accounts present fairly the financial position of the European Union, the results of its operations and its cash flows for that year. Revenue and commitments for payments were free from material error. However, payments were affected by material error, with an estimated error rate of 3.9 % for the European Union budget as a whole. The estimated level for 2010 was similar at 3.7 %. Put simply, the Court found too many examples of European Union spending not hitting the target or being used sub-optimally.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Annual Report’s message is consistent with previous years. Despite an overall fall in the estimated error rate over the current programme period, there remains scope to spend European Union money more efficiently and in a better targeted manner in many different areas and schemes and expenditure programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, the control systems examined by the Court were found to be only partially effective and not realising their full potential to prevent or detect and correct errors. The two areas – or ‘policy groups’ – with the highest estimated error rate were ‘Rural development, environment, fisheries and health’, where the error rate was estimated at 7.7 %, and the policy group ‘Regional policy, energy and transport’, where the error rate was estimated at 6.0 %.</p>
      <p sl="en">In these areas, as in all areas under shared management, national authorities operate the first – and most important – line of defence in protecting the financial interests of EU citizens. But the Court found many instances of control failure at Member State level. For example, in the majority of transactions in regional policy where the Court found errors, sufficient information was available for the Member State authorities to have detected and corrected at least some of those errors before claiming reimbursement from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, the Court also found similar problems in certain areas directly managed by the Commission, including the policy group ‘research and internal policies’, where the Court estimated the error rate to be 3 %.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court notes in this report that the Commission’s directors-general have also recognised a high risk of error in rural development, cohesion and research. They increased their estimate of the spending at risk of irregularity from EUR 400 million in 2010 to EUR 2 billion in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been improvements over the current programming period, but there is still some way to go before European Union financial management is up to standard in all areas of the European Union budget. Many of the problems we have identified in the past still remain, albeit to a lesser extent. In fact, the fall in the Court’s estimated error rate for the European budget as a whole under the current framework shows that improving the rules and design of spending schemes from one period to the next does make a difference. And now, with legislative proposals for the next framework period under discussion, there is a golden opportunity to address their underlying causes.</p>
      <p sl="en">For many years, the Court has called for single schemes with clearer objectives, easier-to-measure results, and more cost-effective control arrangements. This year’s Annual Report confirms this message.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States and Parliament must now agree better rules for how European Union money is spent, and Member States and the Commission must enforce them properly. In this way, the European Union budget could be used more efficiently and effectively to deliver greater added value for citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time as considering the legislative proposals for the next financial framework period, European institutions and Member States are also engaged in setting up new European systems, mechanisms and governance arrangements in other domains related to public financial management, notably regarding the supervision of the financial system and the coordination of fiscal and economic policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The success of these initiatives will depend also on ensuring that the necessary democratic legitimacy and accountability arrangements are in place. In the Court’s view, appropriate public scrutiny and audit of all public funds put at stake to meet the European Union objectives is a key component that must be clearly safeguarded from the outset of such initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ensuring sound public finances has never been more important for the European Union. The Court is committed to contributing, as best it can, to the European Union’s efforts to achieve this important goal, through our work and the Annual Report that I have had the honour to present to you today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, President Caldeira, Mr rapporteur, honourable Members of the Parliament and of the Court of Auditors, the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors is published at a time when the legislative and budgetary authorities are about to finalise the design and the resources for the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">Drawing lessons from previous budgetary discharge procedures, new management and control mechanisms were proposed for the future programmes. The new Financial Regulation introduces considerable reforms, focusing strongly on European added value and simplification. The Commission proposals for the next programming period aim also at strengthening the accountability of all financial actors. Finally, cost-effective control mechanisms were proposed throughout all EU programmes. These measures are likely to address effectively the weaknesses and errors which are currently observed.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the presentation of the Court’s Annual Report in the Budgetary Control Committee earlier this month, Members of this House asked themselves what they could do to improve further the situation. I would like to stress that you – this Parliament – have already substantially contributed to that goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, getting the error rate from 7.3 % in 2006 to 3.9 % in 2011 can be explained largely by the follow-up given by the Commission to your recommendations. It serves to demonstrate the usefulness and added value of a constructive dialogue between the Commission and the discharge authority.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the substantial improvements in the new Financial Regulation would have been impossible to achieve without the very strong cooperation between our two institutions. Thirdly, we still have to get the other proposals adopted by the co-legislators, including programmes under shared management. The Parliament, as discharge authority and co-legislator, has a crucial role to play in promoting sound financial management principles in this context.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council shares with the Parliament the responsibility of putting in place a solid legal framework for the next financial period which will guarantee that the sound financial principles are respected. But the Council will also issue a recommendation to the Parliament on the discharge. This is a unique opportunity to look at what the Member States can do specifically, with the Commission, to improve the performance of the programmes under shared management. Therefore, I call on the current and future Presidencies to organise extensive discussions with the Member States on these important issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now pass to a few points regarding the Court of Auditors report on the financial year 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, for the fifth consecutive time, the Court of Auditors has issued an unqualified positive opinion on the annual accounts of the EU. Secondly, the overall error rate for all payments made in 2011 remains stable compared with 2010, even though the risk profile of the transactions increased in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, commitments and revenues for the entire budget are free from material errors. So, moreover, are the payments for external aid, development, enlargement and administrative expenditure. Fourthly, following the increased error rate for rural development, a thorough action plan is being implemented to identify, in collaboration with the Member States, the root causes of these errors and to address the weaknesses under the current and future programming period.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fifthly, the error rate for internal policies increased, up to 3 %. The Commission is looking into the cases in order to prevent the occurrence of similar problems in the short term. In the longer term, Horizon 2020 will lead to further simplification and fewer errors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in cohesion policy the error rate significantly decreased from 7.7 % in 2010 to 5.1 % in 2011. The report of the Court is a clear signal that more has to be done. The Commission will focus its supervision and assistance on the riskiest areas and partners, and it will pursue a strict management and control policy for the programmes under its direct responsibility. But the Member States have to step up their efforts as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the Court, more than 60 % of those errors identified for the Regional Fund and 76 % for the European Social Fund should have been detected by the national authorities before they sent their claims to the Commission. The room for improvement there is very clear indeed. There will be no let-up in the efforts of the Commission’s services to reduce further the risk of errors. I believe, nonetheless, that it is appropriate to put the estimated error rate into perspective, bearing in mind the main financial responsibility of the Commission: to defend the EU’s financial interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential to stress that the weaknesses identified by the Court do not lead to massive loss of money or fraud. This becomes clearer when taking into consideration the multiannual dimension of the spending programmes and their preventive and corrective mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has recovered or corrected EUR 1.84 billion in incorrect payments in 2011. Even if those amounts also relate to payments made in previous years, in financial terms these financial corrections and recoveries represent 1.4 % of the payments made in 2011. This figure does not yet include amounts recovered or corrected by Member States in the area of cohesion following their own audits and controls.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will endeavour to get more reliable data from the Member States in order to be able to present next year a more complete picture of the corrective measures implemented at EU and national levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following past discharge recommendations of this House, the Commission has taken major steps in order to prevent further errors. In cohesion, the Commission decided in 2011 to initiate 13 suspension procedures and to interrupt the deadlines for 105 payments amounting to a total of EUR 2.75 billion. These instruments will also be strictly applied in the future. From 2014, they will hopefully be complemented by the net correction mechanism proposed for all programmes under shared management.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members of Parliament and of the Court of Auditors, the Commission takes its responsibility seriously and will continue its work to achieve better results in the future for the benefit of EU citizens and taxpayers. It will take all necessary measures to address the weaknesses observed by the Court and intensify its cooperation with the discharge authority to bring about the anticipated improvements. The role of the Member States is essential in this respect, as is their commitment to assuming their responsibility and obligations under shared management. As I have said, I count on the current and next Presidencies to contribute actively to this goal in the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President, unfortunately, the Court of Auditors’ annual report, notwithstanding all of the progress made, gives no cause to silence the alarm bells. The error rate is rising again, with a second consecutive increase in 2011. There are surprisingly high anomalies in rural development and the Cohesion Fund. What I find especially annoying is that 62 % of the errors found by the Court of Auditors should in fact have been detected by the Member States themselves, and this is on the increase. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the way to build trust and confidence. However, the fact that the Court of Auditors steadfastly refuses to publish a breakdown of its statistics on the errors made by each Member State is not the way to do so either.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, there are three lessons to be learned from the report. Firstly, it is clearer than ever, in my view, that EU funds should only be channelled to properly functioning administrations. In other words, what is needed here is more supervisory responsibility for the Commission, but as another logical consequence, there must be conditionalities in relation to the Structural Funds and the agricultural funds. European funds should only flow if European legislation – for example in the field of competition law and procurement – is genuinely being implemented. There should be no cash for unreliable governments and poor administrations!</p>
      <p sl="de">The second lesson is this: surely the error rates must be more transparent, based on a country breakdown? There is still a lingering impression that there is something to hide, and that is not a good signal to send out at a time when we are seeking to build trust and confidence in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, Parliament should do more than simply act as a referee between the Court of Auditors and the Commission. Now, for the first time, we share the responsibility of putting in place a legal framework, notably in respect of agricultural and structural policy, which are the largest areas of the budget. However, do we genuinely have the capacity to exert effective budget control? In other words, are our capacities commensurate with this newly acquired responsibility?</p>
      <p sl="de">The Court of Auditors, the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are powerful and well-established structures. If we genuinely want to exert independent parliamentary control, the European Parliament must have more authority. Exactly where is something that we need to discuss in the discharge procedure.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, President Caldeira, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for presenting this annual report, our most important tool in the discharge procedure for the Commission’s budget. My sincere thanks for this transparent report, which I believe will do much to help us more forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report makes it clear that for the 18th time in succession, there can only be a limited statement of assurance for the work of the Commission, and as Mr Pieper has already said, the trend towards an improving error rate year on year has stopped.</p>
      <p sl="de">This House abides by its demand, however: what we want to see is a clear trend towards an improving error rate in the implementation of the EU budget. We are not prepared to accept the present situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Court of Auditors’ annual report also sends out a clear message to the Council, however, which is meeting this evening in order to find a compromise for the multiannual financial framework. Poorly functioning management and control systems in the Member States, overdue financial corrections at a high level, unnecessarily complicated rules in the Member States: anyone who wants better spending and does not use this as camouflage for cuts can start here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Anyone who wants better spending must improve the controls in the Member States, not cut the budgets. Anyone who wants better spending must also do their homework in their own country, for in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the control systems, according to the Court of Auditors and the Commission, are only effective to a limited extent.</p>
      <p sl="de">What concerns us about budget management in 2011 is that in some areas of the budget, the figures have got worse, as Mr Pieper has already pointed out. In research policy, for example – an area of the budget that is, in fact, directly administered by the Commission – the error rate has doubled from 1.4 to 3 %. Here, we must demand a plan of action from the Commissioner for Research, setting out how the Commission intends to reduce these error rates.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the common agricultural policy, the error rate generally hovered around the materiality threshold of 2 %. Now, the Court of Auditors estimates the error rate in rural development to be an incredible 7.7 %, meaning that spending on rural development has by far the highest error rate of any area investigated.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot be consoled by the explanation that the programmes in the Member States have now reached full maturity, or by the explanation that the number of development projects is also increasing, so the errors are rising as well. No, what we want to see here is a remedy, and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Commissioner Cioloş should be resolute in their efforts to move Member States towards better controls, as has already been achieved in regional policy. This is a good example of how tackling the causes can have a positive effect.</p>
      <p sl="de">The figure of 6 % for erroneous payments as a proportion of the total is still too high but the trend is moving in the right direction. The action plan adopted in 2008 has done much to improve the situation by greatly increasing the Commission’s supervision of the national management and control systems. Commissioner Cioloş should therefore start by seeking ideas for his own action plan to reduce the growing error rates in agricultural policy as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is room for improvement in regional policy too. We want retrospective projects to be removed from funding at last. We want the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to take the same robust action as the Directorate-General for Employment by suspending and cancelling funding programmes if Member States cannot guarantee proper and lawful control, and we want net corrections: Member States should only be able to transfer funds to other projects if they themselves detect errors in project management. If they are unable to detect the errors themselves, as is so often the case, the funding should revert to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for the important work that it undertakes on behalf of the European taxpayer every year. Mr Caldeira, you and the Court are and will remain a valued partner for us as Members of this House, the representatives of the European Union’s discharge authority.</p>
      <p sl="de">A year ago, as we sat here discussing the Court of Auditor’s previous report, I said that the Court’s report presented a positive picture, but there were some grey areas. The picture is becoming steadily brighter, but there are still some spots of grey. The sum of EUR 130 billion was available in 2011, and of this figure, EUR 5 billion should never have been disbursed. That is an error rate of 3.9 %. Compared with previous years, that is an improvement, but it is still much too high. I am at a loss to explain how these figures can possibly be justified in view of the budget constraints throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there are some positive aspects. The instruments that Parliament, in its discharge reports, has given the Commission, especially in recent years, are being utilised at last and are working. This is happening to an exemplary – extremely exemplary – degree in the field of employment and social affairs. The Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and its Commissioner, Mr Andor, have since 2008 applied a consistent policy of suspending and discontinuing payments if current projects simply do not work. As a result, the error rate here has fallen to 2.2 %. I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner Andor, on these consistent efforts, which show how it should be done. I would like to extend these congratulations to Commissioner Šemeta as well, for he is of course involving in overseeing these efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">I myself, as one of the previous rapporteurs for the budget discharge, together with my parliamentary colleagues, reminded the House that funds that have been disbursed without justification must be recovered. This measure is also being used to an increasing extent, and I would like to congratulate you on this as well. My perusal of the Annual Summaries, which we Members are now permitted to inspect, has convinced me that this instrument is working.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards efficiency, there are still some problems here. The evaluation report has rightly been criticised by the Court of Auditors for being too vague. I would like to offer Mr Geier, who is reporting on the budget discharge this year, the support of the House as a whole in order to ensure that the procedure is improved.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, the book in front of us does not present a pretty picture. For the eighteenth time in a row it has not been possible to give a statement of assurance and the margin of error has increased again, albeit slightly, to 3.9 %. The Court of Auditors found errors in a great many policy areas: agriculture, rural development, fisheries, research, health, regional policy, energy, transport. That is no trivial matter. Every one of these policy areas are under the joint management of the Commission and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Šemeta stressed it once again in his speech. He reiterated the figures from the Court of Auditor’s report: 60 % errors in the Regional Fund, 76 % errors in the Social Fund. The Member States should have taken action on this. They knew it but they did not do it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore ask the Court of Auditors: would it not be useful to be clearer in your report on which Member States are at fault? Which are doing it right and which are doing badly? That would be useful for our exercise with rapporteur Geier, because we could then tackle the poor performers more forcefully, give better guidance and get them to face up to their responsibilities. Then we might be able to avoid much of the criticism.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have one final point: I think that we also need to pay far more attention to our own resources, particularly VAT. VAT fraud is estimated at around EUR 100 billion. That is not a trivial matter, certainly in times of crisis. When everyone is having to make savings, I think it is extremely important that, in the fight against fraud, we focus more intensely on combating the criminal organisations that make off with vast amounts of our taxes.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, overall I think that the findings of the European Court of Auditors as worrying. I am of the view that the greatest problem is the error rate in the distribution of Union resources under shared management at Member State level. In view of the fact that there are two areas with an alarming error rate, it is essential to adopt a regime that would enable the Commission to evaluate Member States’ individual difficulties and to react to them in a timely manner.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Financial resources were expended in 2011 in many areas of EU policy in contravention of the rules. The examples mentioned in the Court of Auditors’ Annual Report are often a sad picture of the way in which public resources are handled. Farmers are taking subsidies for more land than they are actually farming and the data in land registries often differ from reality. The employment and social affairs policy has paid out for inappropriate costs, there has been overestimation of personal costs and unsuitable participants have been sent for training. Recipients of Union resources have claimed unjustifiable or unspent costs. The reason for the errors is overestimation of costs on the part of recipients and non-existent supporting documentation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">A considerable number of errors are also associated with the way in which the selection and award procedures are handled. There have been contraventions of conditionality and incorrect data have been provided by both recipients and Member States. The question arises as to whether the rules are actually too complicated or are these shortcomings the result of a reluctance to become thoroughly familiar with them and to be guided by them, or the result of other less honourable intentions. For example, in the regional policy programmes, more than half of the audited operations were beset by errors, even though the Member States’ authorities had sufficient information to be able to detect and correct most of the errors prior to the submission of certified expenditure to the Commission. Indeed, this problem affects not only regional policy, but also other areas of European Union policy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is clear that control in the Member States is failing. I believe that the competent authorities in Member States should work more efficiently and bear more responsibility, since this has been under discussion for a long time now. The control systems in most areas of European Union policy have been considered only partially fit for purpose, and we know that it is essential to put in place transparent rules and strict controls at all levels. Apart from formal controls, however, it is also vital to direct financial resources correctly and to invest in meaningful projects. Even if a given project is formally in order, it need not always be of benefit for European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is now shamefully the 18th year in a row that the auditors cannot clear the EU budget. Worse, 50 % of the samples taken by the auditors show irregularities. The excuses the Commission puts forward are always the same: it is the fault of the Member States: they commit the irregularities. But taxpayers entrust their monies to the European Commission, which abjectly fails to perform essential controls before it hands the cash over to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">This House is also to blame by continually rubber-stamping the EU budget on the basis that ‘error’ does not necessarily mean ‘fraud’. Well, if a farmer gets money for the welfare of his 150 sheep and the auditors find that he does not have any, in the real world this would be considered fraud. The point is that if the Commission refuses to take responsibility for taxpayers’ money and blames Member States, why does it ask for more money to fund those same Member States? This is yet another reason why the EU budget should be cut. What are we waiting for?</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for a good report. Unfortunately, as has been said, it documents the fact that things are moving in the wrong direction. From 2006 to 2009, the incidence of errors in the EU accounts as a whole fell to 3.3 %. This was a good development, but the error rate has increased since then. In 2010 it rose to 3.7 %, and in 2011 it was 3.9 %. It is also interesting to see that the number of errors in the transactions tested has increased considerably, from approximately 33 % in 2010 to 40 % in 2011. This is not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="da">When things were going in the right direction, the Commission took the credit, and, as I said at the time, I do not hold a grudge against the Commission for that. However, it is also clear who is responsible when the error rate increases. Since that time, two years ago, the error rate has risen two years in a row, and it is not right that the Commission deflects the blame onto everyone else, because ultimately it is the Commission that is responsible for the money paid out from the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="da">Next year will therefore be crucial. If we see an increase in the error rate for the third year in a row, it will be impossible for us parliamentarians to justify it to our voters. We can live with it going in the right direction, albeit slowly and from an excessively high level. However, we cannot live with it going in the wrong direction year after year. If so, the voters will punish us hard – and with good reason.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my constituents will not be too surprised to learn that their hard-earned money taken by taxes and passed on to the EU is being negligently handed out by the net recipients of the EU budget. In a week when many Member States are seeking an increase in the EU budget to just over EUR one trillion, my constituents in the UK say this is unacceptable in a time of austerity. The blame for the failure to have the audit signed off for the 18th year lies firmly at the door of the unelected bureaucrats of the EU. They have failed the taxpayers of Europe once again.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note that 60 % of the errors found by the Court could have been detected by Member States, yet it is the quagmire of rules and unnecessary complications that is at fault. And what is the EU doing to correct this? It is not even notifying the Member States concerned of the direct problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the examples of the billions wasted is the EUR 700 million to establish the rule of law and reduce corruption in Kosovo, but the results are poor according to the report. Staff delegated were not even sufficiently trained, yet the EU thinks that by throwing in taxpayers’ money without reasonable constraint it can solve the problem. And what about pan-European parties? What about public financing of political parties such as the right-wing extremist parties to which some UKIP Members have signed up, some Nazis – what about the financing of that? A colleague of mine talked about confidence. Well, the people of the UK have less and less confidence in the EU, which is why we need an in-or-out referendum, sooner rather than later.</p>

      <p sl="nl">It has no doubt already been said in many ways by many others: it is the eighteenth time that the Court of Auditors has not given an unqualified statement of assurance. If Parliament nevertheless discharges the Commission of liability for the seventeenth time, this will be very difficult to defend in the eyes of the general public.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that the Commission must come up with strong proposals to improve the controls. We have tried many things over the years: higher fines, stopping payments. I think we have tried all of the available options.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is only one thing that we have not tried yet, despite the fact that Parliament has been pressing for it for years. That is that if we give money to the Member States, there must be greater political accountability in the Member States that make the most errors. Parliament has tried all kinds of ways to get a Member State statement. These efforts resulted in the annual summaries, as they are called in the Interinstitutional Agreement. I ask myself whether they are effective; I think not.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The new Financial Regulation enables Member States to make a statement voluntarily. I think that the Commission should pursue a very active policy to promote that. The Member States who do that should get obvious benefits as a result. If the European and national audit bodies judge everything to be in order, if their statement is good, the Commission should reward those countries with fewer audits, less bureaucracy, and so on. The Member States should gain from making a political statement on how they have spent the money from Europe.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, anyone reading the European Court of Auditors’ annual report gets the feeling that someone somewhere has made a big mistake. According to the auditors, the budget is not credible, the error rate is high, controls are failing and individual programmes have such shortcomings that no added value can be demonstrated for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">One of the areas where drawdown has been most criticised is regional policy. According to the auditors, 59 % of the operations assessed in this area are beset by errors. The most common error is contravention of the rules for the award of public contracts and inappropriate payments for projects. Indeed, this is where I see the main problem. The fact is that it is not that recipients of European funds are committing fraud or falsifying projects. Recipients simply do not know their way around the extremely complex rules and bureaucratic procedures. They often carry out work in good faith and subsequently find out that they had been barking up the wrong tree and undertaken work which was not allowed or that the Union flag on the facade was the wrong size and so they would have to return the money.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Court of Auditors recommends improving this area by issuing more instructions, closely monitoring the implementation of Union rules, exerting more control and enforcing penalties. This is the wrong way, however. The only way to make a radical reform of the bureaucratic rules is to simplify the whole process and strengthen the participation of end recipients in the projects to be implemented. We should then all be able to implement more simply projects which make sense to us, because they are not cheap.</p>

I congratulate the Court of Auditors on its work.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg and for the eighteenth year in succession it turns out that Member States in the east and south of the Union especially are somewhat casual when it comes to applying for subsidies and are not too fussy about their auditing when it comes to taxpayers’ money from the citizens of northern Europe. Thriftiness is lost on them, it seems, so naming and shaming please.</p>

Firstly, I am ashamed that the Council is not here, despite claiming that it has a role to play in this discharge procedure and insisting that we must respond to its recommendation. Now it is conspicuous by its absence. Secondly, I must say that some of the comments made by fellow Members today are of lamentable quality.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I do think that, for once, we should talk about the aspects where we have not voiced any criticism, at least so far, namely the 96 % that was executed without errors. We need to ask ourselves which policy goals we have achieved. We have mass demonstrations throughout Europe. What have we achieved in relation to youth unemployment with the money that we provided through the European Union? What have we achieved in relation to jobs with the funding for innovation and research? What have we achieved with everything that we are doing in the Member States? I would like to talk about that. I would like to hear more about that, quite frankly. In view of the present situation in the European Union, it could have been a positive moment, when we drew attention to the EU’s positive achievements. That is my first point.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that we should focus on the discharge procedure and on what we have actually done and what the outcomes are, and what we have to show the EU’s citizens and taxpayers. The other aspect cannot be achieved without good administration in the Member States, and it cannot be achieved in the EU either. Commissioner Šemeta, what are we doing, if only one payment in every five in the context of the Cohesion Fund is now correct? Last year, it was one payment in four.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, we urgently need a report from you that offers an overview of how the financial crisis is impacting on public administration in the EU Member States, because we can see that this financial crisis is having an effect here. What should we do then? How should we react? How must we react? I would like us to give some consideration to this issue, and that means the Commission as well: it should consider how to influence the rules in future. After all, the rules determining the type of projects that are eligible for assistance from the Structural Funds are made by the Member States. If the Member States then opt for eligibility criteria that cannot be monitored by us later, we are shooting ourselves in the foot. This means that the Commission must work very closely with the Member States to avoid the minor disasters that we lament here in the House every year.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as rapporteur for the report on protecting the financial interests of the European Union, I certainly welcome the Court of Auditors’ Annual Report. As colleagues have heard already, the annual rate estimated is 3.9 %, however, I do think there are some other things which need to be said as well. For example, I think it is important that the Court has pointed out that there is a difference between error and fraud. Only about 0.2 % of payments are subject to fraud.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the Court of Auditors perhaps needs to look at its systems and methods here. For example, overpayments and underpayments are categorised in exactly the same way, minor errors in terms of providing information and filling in documents are also classified as errors. I just wondered if in future the Court might find it possible to make a distinction between those different types of things.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think it is important that, for the first time, the Court, in Chapter 10, has started to look at the improvement assessment of the Commission as well. I know the Court says that this does need to be improved. I think it is a good start, because I think part of the Court’s function should be to look for improvement. I think, indeed, we all need to look for improvements, whether in the Court, in Parliament, in Member States or in the Commission – improvements in terms of the procurement policy, in terms of simplification, maybe having a more risk-based audit in the future: these are all things which can lead to improvement. At the end of the day audits are good, but audits should also lead to improvements in our systems.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are going round in circles. Every year, we hear about similar error rates. Every year, we hear that a positive statement of assurance cannot be issued, in the same area. Every year, we are forced to note with regret that the Commission President, Mr Barroso, has not met the target he set in January 2005.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our progress can be measured in millimetres. One problem is surely that the EU budget is, in a sense, the European Union’s Achilles heel. It is also the source of so many unnecessary disputes; this can clearly be observed in Brussels or, indeed, here in plenary today. There is a massive and fundamental need for action as regards the reform of the European budget, on both the revenue and the expenditure side.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the expenditure side, and this has already been mentioned, it is important for the Member States to take responsibility at last, firstly for the error rate in the administration of funds, and secondly as regards the recovery of funds. For the revenue side, it is essential, in my view, to make the abolition of the national contributions our long-term goal and to replace them with key instruments such as the financial transaction tax. This could avoid unnecessary conflicts over the EU budget at last, and, above all, put an end to the ceaseless debates about rebates and rebates of rebates. I think that would be an important step forward.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, we are once again in the paradoxical situation of having succeeded, on the one hand, in monitoring and keeping free from error 96 % of the EU budget, in one of the most complex financial years from the point of view of the allocation, implementation and amount of funding, while that budget continues, on the other hand, to remain below 1 % of the European Union’s gross domestic product.</p>
      <p sl="es">In spite, then, of having managed to operate one of the most complex, refined and advanced control systems, thanks to the fruitful dialogue between the Court of Auditors, Commission and Parliament, the results of which will be seen, moreover, in the discharge exercise overseen by my colleague Jens Geier, we are again complaining about not having broken free of a sort of cycle of victimisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, I think that, this year, the focus of our concerns should be far more tangible issues, namely the errors made by Member States, for instance, with regard to rural development. We knew that, by abandoning direct assistance for rural development under the common agricultural policy, we would increase the risk of errors in the Member States. However, we also know, from our experience with regional development, that when we exercise firm control and step up our demands, as has been the case with cohesion policy, the Member States react. We therefore need to refine and develop this control further in respect of the Member States; one day, perhaps, we will also have to scrutinise what their audit authorities are doing. Ms Sinclaire should take note: there will surely be some interesting surprises in store for us.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards the Commission – and Mr Šemeta has a certain responsibility in this respect – we are greatly concerned by the errors affecting research policy. As this very policy is one of our weapons for defeating this crisis, he needs to explain to us how we can go about rectifying these errors.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Caldeira and his staff at the Court of Auditors for this annual report. It is a very good starting point for Parliament to carry out the discharge procedure over the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Second, according to a well-known Hungarian saying, two people may be talking about the same thing but one says that the glass is half full and the other says that it is half empty. I fall into the camp that thinks that the glass in this case – rigorous implementation of the European Union’s budget – is half empty. It is unacceptable that not only has the downward trend in the error rate disappeared, the error rate has actually increased for the second year running. My voters would not accept that European money has been spent less optimally in recent years than before. They would not be able to support this report.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Third, allow me also to make the point that it is unacceptable that Council representatives are absent from Parliament when we discuss this issue. For nearly three years now the European Council has had a permanent President, but both he and his staff have been constantly absent. The European Council always has a President-in-Office, but the staff of the President-in-Office are also consistently absent. If 62 % of the errors identified for cohesion policy should have been detected by national governments, the Council should be present here in Parliament to represent those governments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Last but not least, I agree that the trend is better as far as the use of cohesion resources is concerned. The error rate fell from 7.7 % in 2010 to 5.1 % in 2011. I think this is a good message to send to the European Council summit which gets under way today, and where the key issue is whether it will be possible to uphold one of the EU’s fundamental principles, that of solidarity, in the seven-year budgetary period by way of sustaining cohesion funding.</p>

      <p sl="sl">I join with those who have mentioned today that the situation needs to be monitored in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is vitally important that cohesion policy, which is one of the most important tools for promoting economic growth and new investment, remains in the coming seven years a strong and financially supported European policy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">For this reason it is all the more important at this point to highlight the fact that we will not achieve better spending by cutting funds, but only through effective control and specific commitments from Member States to better management of funds.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, President of the Court of Auditors, I would like to start by thanking you and all of the members of the Court – including Ms Kaljulaid, who is here with you – for the work you do and in particular for the attention you pay to Members of the European Parliament. You pay us a great deal of attention and I really wanted to thank you for that. I would also like to thank Commissioner Šemeta, who, following on from the remarkable work of his predecessor, continues to improve the auditing of our accounts and the quality of special reports. I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague, Bogusław Sonik, who has been detained by other parliamentary commitments. I too regret the absence of the Council, which is the budgetary authority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this report comes too late. That is not your fault. I tabled amendments to the Financial Regulation to change the timetable. The European Commission must present the accounts before 31 March each year, the Court must publish its report before 30 June, and Parliament must vote before 31 December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is inconceivable that today, in November, we should still be talking about matters concerning 2011. I suggest that the working group that I have proposed should meet to change this timetable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make a few observations: Article 323 of the Treaty suggests that Parliament should ensure that the necessary financial means are made available to the European Union. I wonder if the Court could not play a role in raising the alarm about the Union’s cash position: we have learned that we had a shortfall of EUR 9 billion and we are incapable of paying our bills. I would therefore suggest that the Court can help us to monitor the functioning of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A final word about shared management: I think that we need to take another look at it here. I wonder about the independence of the audit authorities and about relations with our national audit institutions, and I think that the shared management system – which has proved useful in its time – should be re-examined. I wonder if we should not create our own finance function at Union level and get rid of this system of shared management, which contains a lot of errors, is very expensive and the efficiency of which merits re-examination.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, allow me to join my colleagues in welcoming the European Court of Auditors’ Annual Report on the implementation of the budget concerning the financial year 2011. I would like to briefly comment on some aspects of it that I find particularly important.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly: shared management. The report states that the highest error rates were found in policy areas under the shared management arrangements, namely in rural development and regional policy. If we want to improve the efficiency of control systems, all stakeholders should take their responsibility – including the Commission – but also, and especially, the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly: direct management. 20 % of EU money is spent directly by the Commission, and the findings of the Court state that the error rate for research and other internal policies increased from 1.4 % to 3 % in 2011. Like my colleagues, I would be curious to learn the reason for this increase and what measures are being considered by the Commission to remedy this situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly: the link between inputs and results. I really welcome the new Chapter 10 of the Annual Report entitled ‘Getting results from the EU budget’. I believe that it is a step in the right direction. The EU budget should shift from a compliance-oriented to a performance-oriented model of spending – a model that looks at the results achieved. We need clear indicators, base lines and target levels in order to assess the achievements of these EU policies. The Court of Auditors’ report states clearly that there is scope for improvement. The Union faces a very important challenge: to do more with less money. Therefore, it is all of us together – Commission, European Parliament, Member States – who should find a way to spend every euro in a more efficient and effective way, to bring maximum results in these times of austerity. This is what European citizens are expecting from us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, please allow me, since this is my last speech in plenary, to use this opportunity to thank all my colleagues from the European Parliament – especially the colleagues from the Budgetary Control Committee and our secretariat – for the excellent cooperation we have had throughout the years. I am grateful for these years full of dynamic and lively discussions from which I have learned a lot, and I hope we will continue this cooperation. You can rest assured that dialogue with this Parliament will be a key priority in my future work.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, in general, we can say that the European Union has spent the money at its disposal, some EUR 129 billion, better than in the previous year. Although the Council and Parliament decide jointly on the annual budget, it is primarily the Commission that has to ensure that the money is used properly and, let us be honest, there is room for improvement there. The 2011 report shows that we are moving in the right direction but the error rate is high, as we have discussed. Indeed, in the area of research and development expenditure the error rate is on the rise, but it is very significant under the agricultural and cohesion headings, which make up 80 % of expenditures. Inaccuracy is on the increase in other areas too, and there are also inappropriate payments. Responsibility for this is shared of course between the Commission and the Member States, but it shows that the problem is systemic. The Commission mechanisms are only partially effective and, sadly, these resources are increasingly failing to reach their intended targets, or could not be used effectively. I agree with the Commissioner that we need added value and simplification. The task ahead is clear: with an increasing deficit paired with reduced resources we need to reform our system in this way and monitoring will be much more effective.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to know what excuses Member States are offering for failing to keep their accounts in proper order. I wonder whether they compare with the excuses being offered by Mr Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, for failing to keep his personal accounts in order. He has made a commitment to complete transparency, but you take one look at his website and you can see that the accounts are unaudited make-believe. By way of excuse, he said that he has lost his receipts, but then, on another occasion he said ‘I have an awful lot of receipts that aren’t there’ – whatever that means. He has gone on to say that he has not had the time to sort out his expenses, despite employing his wife to do these things, and then he said ‘there were some receipts lost, but so what! ‘</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the debate clearly shows that shared management is still one of the main topics also for this year’s budgetary discharge procedure. But there remain issues for the funds under direct management by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that the Commission will carefully analyse the Court’s observations and that it will implement its recommendations in due course. The work has already started and I would like to draw your attention to the annual activity reports of directors-general of the Commission which for the first time in their history almost completely correspond with the assessment of the Court and on the basis of those annual activity reports and on the basis of reservations made by the Director-General of AGRI, the Director-General of Research and other directors-general, they have to produce concrete action plans on how to improve the situation in the areas under their management.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that my colleagues, Commissioner Cioloş, Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, Commissioner Hahn and others will participate in the discharge procedure and will explain what concrete actions they will implement in order to address the problems reflected in the reservations of their directors-general. I would like also to draw your attention to one aspect, which is that when we talk about complicated rules it is not only complicated rules at an EU level; and as I said in my introductory statement, we made proposals for the next financial period to significantly simplify EU rules. It is also very problematic that Member States introduce even more complicated rules and quite a significant amount of errors are caused by complicated rules at Member State level. This issue, I believe, has to be addressed very thoroughly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bart Staes raised the issue of own resources and VAT fraud and the Commission is working very hard on this subject and we tabled a proposal on a fast reaction mechanism. We are looking forward to a swift adoption of this proposal by the Council which will significantly reduce the risk of fraud on VAT and next month I will come with a package of proposals on how to fight tax fraud and evasion, including measures on further improvements in the VAT area. I hope that these measures will provide sufficient tools in order to improve the situation in the area of VAT collection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur also mentioned the issues related to net corrections and I think that it is very important that the legislation which is currently on the table includes the net corrections for the next financial programming period and as I understand it we are moving in this direction. I hope that finally legislation will be adopted containing this very important provision.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me first thank the honourable Members for their kind words to me and to those working in the Court of Auditors. Rest assured that we do our utmost to contribute to the effort that addresses the key priority we face today: to ensure sound financial management of public finances in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been asked whether, if receipts are missing, an auditor can accept a reply of ‘So what?’ I would say probably in some instances the receipts are not there, and you can go to our report and see that we have identified the problem and said there is a missing receipt and we have to draw the consequences. An auditor cannot accept ‘So what?’ as a reply.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those responsible, like those in this House, also have a role to play in addressing the underlying courses of the problems. Many Members have stressed the need to improve from where we are. But we should remember where we were at the beginning of this framework programming period and note where we are today. This shows improvement: what the Court is saying is that to make the best use of the funds available, there is scope to use them more efficiently and in a better targeted way. But here, indeed, the national authorities have a key fundamental role to play, because they are the first line of defence in terms of the best use of these funds. Of course, if you add complexity because you devolve to national authorities the eligibility conditions for payments to be made, then you may end up with 27 different sets of eligibility conditions. That will certainly lead to complexity.</p>
      <p sl="en">But now, whilst we are addressing the future regulations for the next framework period, we have a golden opportunity to address the causes of the problems. Systems are there for a period, so we would not expect that error rates or the most likely error will move from 0 to 10 or from 1 to 100. No: systems are there; if you do not solve the causes of the problems we cannot expect huge changes afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our recommendation, honourable Members, is clear: for a long time we have been calling for simpler schemes for using the funds, and for action on defining them and assigning to them clear objectives and cost-effective control systems. We should also aim to be in a position to see whether we want to tolerate the risk of error in some situations. That is a task this House and the Council were invited to reflect upon by the Court of Auditors in 2004.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our task, as auditors, is to address the risk areas. This is a matter of priority for us. We draw up clear recommendations for improvements. That is our role and we are doing that as much as we can. We are also aware, Mr Vaughan, that administrative errors may occur and if they are there they indicate that we have a potentially high risk in the system that will materialise afterwards in quantifiable situations which may put all of the money at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully share the view of Mrs Gräßle that Member States and the Commission need to work together to make things revolve when they have a shared responsibility, and I want to reassure Mr Audy that I have taken good note of his suggestion of the Court’s rôle d’alerte . There is scope to make an effort to bring problems to the attention of this House. My colleagues and I will duly consider that request.</p>

Last year, the Court delivered no comments for most of the agencies. I am glad to see that this year this is no longer the case: the Court took its responsibilities more seriously. This will help the discharge authority to fulfil its duties although our work goes far beyond stamping the Court’s reports. I am concerned that procurement procedure rules are not always respected. This led to a qualified opinion on the ECDC’s accounts due to irregularities over a EUR 9 million framework contract. Twenty-two agencies still need to improve transparency of their recruitment procedures. In general the newly-created agencies face the greatest challenges, especially concerning budgetary and financial management. I encourage them to get-up-to-speed quickly. I commend that the conclusions of the Court’s Special Report on conflict of interest have been integrated in the reports on EMA, EFSA, EASA and ECHA. I note that one comment in the EEA report relates to the issue. The work started on conflict of interest during the 2010 discharge will continue and progress will be monitored.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is shameful that the Court of Auditors, for the 18th time in succession, cannot give a positive assessment of the management of EU funds. Most errors have, once again, occurred in the largest areas of expenditure, namely agriculture and cohesion. Once again, the Court of Auditors has uncovered the blind spots in the EU’s cohesion policy. Vast amounts of funding have bypassed their original target. The Court of Auditors’ report is, therefore, hardly a glowing testimonial for the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Dr Johannes Hahn. Like many Austrians, I would have expected Dr Hahn to take steps to correct this unhappy situation, instead of making the error rate worse. In the context of the Cohesion Fund, for example, not even one payment in five was correct in 2011, whereas the previous year, at least it was ‘only’ one in four! The amount of funds not paid out also reached record highs, even though some Member States are funding their projects entirely from the EU. In difficult economic times, the EU needs efficient investments. Turning on the financial taps is not enough, however. As regards Greece in particular, the Commissioner should dispense with this creed. In Greece, a great deal of money trickles away into dubious channels due to a lack of structural reforms; even Dr Hahn has admitted that billions of euros have failed to reach their intended target due to the inefficiency of the Greek authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to begin my speech, at the end of this dossier, by taking this opportunity to thank everyone who helped to make this Omnibus II report a report that the Committee on International Trade could discuss and vote on with no problems, and I hope that the same will now apply to the vote in Parliament as well. My sincere thanks go to the shadow rapporteurs, the committee secretariat, and also the secretariat of our Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D Group), which always gave us outstanding support. I would particularly like to thank the member of staff responsible in my own office. These activities create a heavy workload, and I think it is important, for once, to recognise this with thanks and give credit where it is due.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament’s rights of codecision now apply to the area of trade policy as well, and we are already witnessing the benefits of this for trade policy itself. However, it also means that various items of legislation must be amended, with the old comitology procedure being translated into a new procedure. The Omnibus I and Omnibus II reports have ensured that matters previously dealt with in the comitology procedure can now dealt with through delegated and implementing acts. Omnibus I focused on implementing acts. Omnibus II, my report, deals with delegated acts. Of course, we cooperated very closely in order to achieve a good result.</p>
      <p sl="de">What has happened now, however? We wanted to enter into negotiations with the Council in order to bring the matter to a swift conclusion. The Council is doing nothing. The Council is not here. Its seat, as usual, is empty. The Council has taken no further decision and its position on this issue, which concerns legal technicalities, is the same as it always is on major issues. It stalls on issues where it really should be providing impetus and moving things forward. That is to say nothing of the budget, where we are experiencing incredible difficulties. However, it is a mirror image of what has happened with Omnibus as well. Let me say this, even though this is not directly related to the matter at hand: if we continue to have a situation in which national egotism and the vanity of the heads of state and government massively impede normal operations here, we will face major difficulties. There are already murmurings in some Member States about a return to a national currency or the introduction of a ‘northern euro’ or some such nonsense. That is where we are now, and I hold the Council primarily responsible. I urge the Council to reflect and adopt a serious approach to its work on all matters, and that includes this dossier as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">As to content, the matter at hand is to decide on the delegation of decision-making powers to the Commission. In which areas should the Commission be able to adopt delegated acts, and where should the European Parliament be involved? I think that we have found a sensible middle way here. At my initiative, Parliament – firstly in committee, and I hope now in plenary – has agreed to limit in time the conferral of powers on the Commission. We are proposing to limit the delegation of power for a period of five years. I believe this is a sensible approach, as this five-year period enables us to exercise better control of the Commission’s activities. In other respects too, we have sought to achieve the right balance, especially as regards the powers of Parliament and the areas where, due to its large number of experts and its technical capacities, the Commission should make decisions, and I think we have found the right way forward here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that this legislation will be supported by a large majority here in plenary so that we can send out a clear signal that Parliament as a whole is united in its backing for this measure.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission is very grateful to Mr Leichtfried, the rapporteur, to Chairman Moreira, and to the other honourable Members who worked on this report, and for the overall support for the Commission’s proposal. The European Parliament has proposed many amendments, most of which we can accept. In particular, the Commission can accept the change to the period of time of the delegation, from unlimited to a five-year period with tacit renewal.</p>

We cannot accept this, unless the extension of such a period is justified by the specificities of the regulation concerned.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I welcome the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, which aims to modify 10 regulations relating to the common commercial policy to bring them into line with the Treaty of Lisbon. I wish to congratulate my colleague Jörg Leichtfried for his work on this technical report, which is essential for good interinstitutional procedures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is well known that in the EU’s interinstitutional relations, the European Parliament and the Council are responsible for adopting legislation. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Lisbon is the first to introduce delegated acts, through Article 290, which states that the European Parliament and the Council may delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts and give the Commission certain competences that would ensure a more efficient decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, the two co-legislators retain the right to revoke this delegation at any time and express their objections within a certain period of time. I share the rapporteur’s opinion that Parliament’s experts should participate in the Commission’s own expert meetings to prepare and implement the delegated acts under the common commercial policy regulations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also agree with limiting the delegation powers of the Commission to a maximum of five years. This will enable the European Parliament to monitor more closely the decisions of the European executive.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is one thing: we delegate choices regarding trade policy to the Commission, and that is only right. However, the substance of the matter is something else. What we, the group of the Northern League, representing the regions of Northern Italy, are worried about are the decisions on trade, the progressive reduction of duties, the lack of any industrial policy, and concession of advantages to multinationals.</p>
      <p sl="it">In other words, it is acceptable that Parliament should delegate decisions to the Commission at a technical level, but it is not a good thing that we are slaves and victims of the outdated economic and industrial policy of the World Trade Organisation, which favours the large foreign powers, making no effort to defend our manufacturers. I am not sure if you are aware of the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are closing in Lombardy and Veneto due to trade agreements that offer no protection to our products.</p>
      <p sl="it">It would be a mistake to believe that research and innovation alone will take us very far. There is a real risk that we will become like the countries of Eastern or Northern Europe, the United States or Asia, where all of the shopping malls now belong to the large multinationals. Therefore, as Parliament, we should delegate the power to adopt these acts regarding trade policy to the Commission, in the hope, however, that the Commission will revise, modernise and defend a manufacturing and trade system that will otherwise disappear.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Madam President, perhaps I have misunderstood. Is the Member suggesting that the European Union should withdraw from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), or is it his view that we should revert to a situation in which the individual Member States conduct the WTO negotiations and that this would be preferable? I am a member of the House’s WTO working group and I can assure you that by presenting a united front, the European Union is a much stronger force in WTO negotiations than the sum of its parts, and we achieve much more by acting together. Moreover, nothing that is negotiated in the WTO should be decided by means of a delegated act. Such matters are decided by the European Parliament and that is a good thing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Jörg Leichtfried. In my view, he has succeeded in devising a way forward which all the groups can support. I know from experience that the negotiations that lie ahead will not be easy, especially as a number of Member States have what I can only describe as an allergic reaction to the issue of delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite the lip service paid in fine speeches to the importance of the European Parliament and how it should be granted more powers, these same government representatives are refusing to recognise Parliament’s equal role to the Council, as an legislator with equal rights, when it comes to amending the legislative procedure. As a legislator, however, we are prepared to delegate powers to the Commission in specific cases, subject to a limit in time, while retaining a right of veto.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council is no longer the only institution to sit at the table with the Commission. I therefore urge the Council to stop dragging its feet. Due to this issue, we have already lost far too much time on a number of important dossiers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Omnibus II – alongside Omnibus I, for which I am the rapporteur – is the second procedure intended to bring European commercial legislation into line with the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. Delegated and implementing acts are now to be incorporated into commercial law as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards delegated acts, one issue of general importance to me is to ensure that Parliament can fully exercise its rights in this respect. However, calling for staff from the parliamentary administration to participate in the Commission’s preparatory meetings sends out the wrong signal. What is needed is direct political control by Members of this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission must ensure that Members are informed about any planned delegated act at an early stage. I hope that the deliberations in the Council will be concluded soon so that we can commence compromise negotiations on Omnibus II swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="de">On a broader point, my view – and this issue has been discussed frequently with the rapporteur for Omnibus II – is that Omnibus I and II are a package and should be negotiated, as far as possible, in parallel. I would therefore like to express my particular thanks to Mr Leichtfried, firstly because we have been able to table his report here in plenary – and that was also discussed between us, because I think a vote in plenary puts us in a better position – and secondly, because from now on, we will indeed be able to work together in parallel.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to make one final comment. I completely agree with the view of our Social Democratic colleagues as regards the role of the European Union and the European Parliament in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly. Twenty-seven countries acting together are stronger than 27 individual voices. The dual role – national and European level – comes into play very effectively in the WTO, in my view, and we should use this as a model for our representation in other international bodies as well.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank Mr Leichtfried for this document. It is important because it provides better definition of the interinstitutional relations between Parliament and the Commission on an extremely sensitive question: Parliament’s powers have been extended in the area of trade, which was not part its competences under the ordinary legislative procedure. There is therefore a fundamental problem, not with the Regulations we are amending today, which are being adapted to a new regime, but in terms of the relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this regard, although I welcome Mr Leichtfried’s report, I am not at all pleased with the views expressed by the Commissioner in this House. The relationship between Parliament and the Commission is still overly technical. There is an evident and continuous effort by the Commission and the Council to reduce relations with the European Parliament to their pre-Lisbon level and we cannot allow this to happen.</p>
      <p sl="it">Limiting the powers of the Commission is an important step that should result in more parliamentary control and make the Commission act in a more focused manner. Only in this way can we respond to the problems raised by Mr Salvini: I completely agree that the EU’s exclusive competence in the area of trade policy should be maintained, and that the EU’s power should be increased over that of the individual Member States. However, we must also be stronger within the World Trade Organisation, in the knowledge that unless we pay more attention to the real economy, we will never emerge from the current crisis.</p>

I would recall that a number of the amendments which are a matter of concern to the Commission relate to matters which are covered by the framework agreement between the Commission and the Parliament. The Commission is, of course, fully committed to implementing the 2010 revised framework agreement between our institutions and believes that this agreement offers the best place to address Parliament’s concerns, rather than this particular piece of legislation that we have discussed today.</p>
      <p sl="en">In any event, I took careful note of your remarks and I will pass them on to Commissioner De Gucht.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, trade policy shows one thing very clearly. We may not agree with some of the decisions taken at the WTO level, and I myself take the view that there are many things that should be done differently, but one thing is very clear. Our combined strength is much greater than that of the individual Member States. Anyone who fails to grasp this point and lets their country go its own way, if it wishes to do so, will ultimately lead their country into the abyss. The European Union’s trade policy also shows that a policy field can function if everyone adopts a unified and unanimous approach, unlike the situation in other policy areas that are dominated by the Council, which is still not here and is still not listening. I think that is obvious.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have a message for the Commission. It is all well and good for you to say that you accept this but you do not accept that. The European Parliament is the legislator. If we agree this today, then that is what we have agreed and this constitutes a legislative act. However, I am also convinced that in the negotiations in the trialogue – should the Council condescend to reach a decision on that – we will achieve a good outcome which moves us in the right direction.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Vital Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on measures to protect the EU market from unusually low-priced imports of Chinese origin, especially photovoltaic panels (O-000162/2012 – B7-0366/2012).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-073-000" speaker_id="96930" name="Vital Moreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China poses the biggest challenge to European Union trade policy. I am quoting the Directorate-General for Trade. China has quickly become the world’s second largest economy and biggest exporter in the global economy. It therefore offers huge opportunities, but also significant challenges to the European economy. In just two decades we have gone from a situation where our commercial ties were virtually non-existent to the current situation of forming the second largest economic partnership in the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Our businesses can take advantage of the incredible business opportunities offered by the growing Chinese market. However, access to this market continues to be difficult in many ways, even though it has improved in recent years. Foreign businesses face a series of commercial barriers in China, which do not exist in the European Union. Conversely, Chinese exporters have benefited hugely from the European Union’s open market. The successful Chinese penetration is particularly due to low prices. At times the prices are abnormally low, which cannot be explained solely by equally low wages and environmental standards in China.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The state subsidisation of exporting industries, extensive infringement of industrial property rights and dumping are surely part of the explanation, as apparent from the report adopted in this Parliament last May entitled ‘EU and China: Unbalanced Trade?’ Obviously, that report by Marielle de Sarnez answered that question with a ‘yes’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Both the European Union and China clearly have much to gain from intensifying their trade relations, provided that this occurs in accordance with the rules of the game, under conditions of fair trade and reciprocal treatment. However, concerns about China’s less fair trade practices have been on the increase and have resulted in the European Union adopting anti-dumping measures, as recently happened in the ceramics sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet the issue of abnormally low prices does not exist solely in those sectors regarded as traditional. On the contrary, the devastating Chinese competition is also affecting some of the European Union’s most innovative industries, including the solar panel industry, which has seen a huge rise in imports of Chinese products, leading to serious concerns about the economic sustainability of that European industry.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On that basis, the Committee on International Trade, which I chair, decided to ask an oral question about China, which it is my job to convey to this House and to the Commission. I must therefore ask, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade:</p>
      <p sl="pt">First, is the EU prepared to respond in an appropriate and timely fashion to these concerns?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Second, can the Commission confirm that the number of cases of imports from China being sold at abnormally low prices is increasing? Which cases have been brought to the Commission’s attention?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Third, the European Union and the United States are the main markets for photovoltaic applications due to public support schemes for renewable energies. Is it likely that United States anti-dumping measures will have consequences for the European Union market, that is through a diversion of exports to the European Union? Can the Commission provide statistics on the mutual ownership of companies based respectively in the European Union, the United States and China in the solar sector?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fourth, what is the Commission’s assessment of the situation of the photovoltaic sector and of the polysilicon exporting sector in the European Union? Does it think increased imports from China could injure industry in the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fifth, can the Commission explain how it intends to adapt the instruments at its disposal to an EU-wide strategy to develop the renewable energy sector and European Union exports in this sector?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Lastly, moreover, how does the Commission intend to develop a common industrial strategy with Member States in order to maintain the competitiveness of the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are the questions that my committee approved. These are the questions on which I await an answer from the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht very much regrets not being with you today, despite attempts to hold this debate earlier. He is in Brussels for negotiations with his Canadian counterpart in what we hope will be a conclusive set of talks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the oral question at hand, allegations of Chinese unfair trade have been around for a long time, as we know. It is a fact that China accounts for the largest proportion of EU trade defence investigations and of measures imposed. China is Europe’s largest trading partner. Some of the increase in Chinese export volume has been achieved through the use of unfair trade practices such as dumping and subsidisation. As a result, it is not surprising that there should be a relatively large number of trade defence cases involving China.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the reason why the spotlight is increasingly on this issue is the size and strategic nature of the sectors now being affected by low-priced Chinese imports. Sectors in which Europe has so far had the upper hand in terms of technological advancement and sophistication are now increasingly facing Chinese competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is the most open market in the world and we welcome competition for its potential to stimulate technological improvements and lower consumer prices. Where competition is unfair, as happens to European companies either because of foreign exports on the EU market, or market access restrictions for EU exports to foreign markets, the Commission has a role to play in accordance with internationally agreed trade rules. So, if European industry brings forward evidence of unfair trade, the Commission will investigate the matter, whether this concerns China or any other trading partner. We have both a duty and a legal obligation to restore the level playing field so that European industry can compete on fair terms, provided that measures are in the overall interest of the Union. This includes an assessment of the possible impact of measures on downstream and upstream industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 6 September this year, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping investigation into imports of solar panels from China following a complaint by the European solar panel industry. Two months later, the Commission also initiated an anti-subsidy investigation in relation to the same product. The initial evidence presented by the European industry indicates that Chinese exports of solar panels are sold at dumped and subsidised prices, and imports have increased dramatically at prices which appear to heavily undercut those of EU manufacturers. These investigations cover solar panel imports with a value of more than EUR 20 billion annually – a record value in the history of EU trade defence. The alleged dumping and subsidies will be investigated in line with our legal procedures, in accordance with our WTO obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European solar panel industry is facing difficult times. To establish to what extent this situation is due to Chinese unfair competition is the very purpose of the ongoing investigations. The oral question put to the Commission by Professor Moreira refers to the fact that the United States imposed definitive anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on imports of solar panels from China on 7 November – just a few weeks ago. In our investigation, we will examine whether US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures will lead to a diversion of Chinese exports to the European market. But it has to be borne in mind that US imports from China are around USD 3 billion per year, far lower than the EU’s.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, the Commission will thoroughly investigate all of the relevant aspects of the case and will, at the latest by June next year, issue its provisional findings. As always, interested parties will be given the opportunity to comment before a definitive conclusion is drawn.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the global market for solar cells has obviously collapsed, a situation which in my view has undoubtedly been caused first and foremost by dumping and subsidies in China. Overcapacity has now reached such a dramatic scale that in 2011, according to Goldman Sachs, production capacity stood at 45 gigawatts in China alone, compared with only 28 gigawatts of new installations worldwide. I am firmly opposed to protectionism, but in this instance, the dumping is obvious.</p>
      <p sl="de">My first request to the Commission is this: we should do our utmost to ensure that the maximum nine-month period for the preliminary investigations is not utilised to the full. The Commission should do everything in its power to speed up the investigations so that they can be concluded well before the maximum nine-month period expires.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, there are signs that at present, the warehouses are being emptied at a very rapid pace in China, with shiploads of solar modules now already being transported to the European Union. I therefore request the Commission to look at the issue of pre-registration as well. We must do our utmost to ensure that this anti-dumping instrument, should it enter into force, can achieve at least a modicum of effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="de">That brings us to the issue at hand. I have serious doubts that we can solve the problem by means of the anti-dumping instrument and negotiations. What the Chinese have done here, particularly in recent months, is unbelievable! My greatest concern is that the Chinese Government is clearly exerting massive pressure on many companies in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot have a situation in which companies – and not just a few, but large numbers – come to us in Parliament and say: ‘Please do everything you can to ensure that this anti-dumping case does not go ahead. Please help us, because if it does go ahead, we must expect massive restrictions in the Chinese market’. For that very reason, it is time we sent a clear signal to China at long last that the situation that has prevailed over recent years cannot continue. We have sheathed our claws for far too long in these dumping cases. It is time to stop knuckling under!</p>
      <p sl="de">My problem is as follows. Companies are coming to me and saying that this case should not be taken forward, there is nothing more that can be salvaged, and we would do better to focus on the next case. However, when the next case comes around, it will be the same scenario and we will hear exactly the same arguments being put forward. I would be very grateful if the Commission could investigate this anti-dumping case swiftly and then act fast to take effective measures, if there is clear evidence that dumping is indeed taking place.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here? We are dealing with an issue which concerns fair trade. This is not about protectionism for European products. There is one issue, and one issue alone, at stake, namely ensuring that our trade relations are based on fairness. I therefore believe that the threat scenario that China is now creating is completely inappropriate. Let me make it very clear: we want transparency in the investigations, and we do not welcome attempts by China to obstruct these investigations by creating threat scenarios, in which European companies are put under pressure with the threat of countermeasures that are supposedly in the pipeline. No, that is not part of the discussion! We intend to investigate the matter. In reality, however, it is about the following issue. Under what kind of working conditions are the solar panels produced in China? Which direct and indirect subsidies go towards supporting their production? What about the value chain as a whole? There are many different aspects which need to be investigated very carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is undoubtedly overcapacity. We cannot have a situation in which dumping is used to reduce overcapacity, at the expense of European jobs and industry. That is why we need to achieve transparency here. Hence my question, and this is also addressed to the Commission: does this transparency exist on the Chinese side as well? Does the Commission have the opportunity to look at all of the relevant facts? That should have been China’s immediate reaction: instead of making threatening gestures, it should have created transparency. Secondly, are you willing to pursue this process to the end, even if China were to yield at the last moment? We do not want a situation like the ethanol case with the United States, when the procedure was shelved at the last minute! I urge you to pursue it right to the end.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am delighted that the Commission has decided to open these two investigations, but I would like the two investigations to be seen through to the end, and I echo Daniel Caspary’s request that the process should, if possible, be accelerated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These products – photovoltaic panels from China – account for EUR 21 billion of imports a year, which represents 10 % of total Chinese exports to Europe. Obviously, with such a large volume, Beijing’s unfair practice of subsidisation puts the entire European photovoltaic industry in peril.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I said in my report on relations between the European Union and China, Europe should not hesitate to use trade defence instruments whenever the principle of fair trading is not respected, and must obviously do so in accordance with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, other major players in international trade, such as the United States, have got to grips with the issue. They recently imposed import tariffs of 24 to 36 % on Chinese solar panels sold at abnormally low prices in the United States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not about Europe starting a trade war with China: it is simply about stopping being naïve, enforcing our rights, and preserving our industry and jobs. Our new relationship with China must be one based on reciprocity. This principle must govern all areas, within the framework of a real and balanced partnership, but this will require Europe to adopt not only trade defence measures, but also an offensive industrial policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The renewable energy sector is of particular strategic importance, as it can be a source of growth for the future. If we so decide, we have the capacity to put Europe in the vanguard. We have the technology, the know-how, and, vitally, the human capital. What we are lacking is the will to do this together. It really is a matter of urgency, so let us decide to do it now!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot address the Presidency, since it is not here. We spend our time, in our constituencies and our countries, defending Europe, saying: ‘There will be no way out of the crisis without Europe!’. Europe is complicated: it is made up of 27 states, soon to be 28, and it is always extremely difficult to come to and implement European decisions quickly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Forgive me, Commissioner, but when I listen to you, I think: ‘I hope workers in the photovoltaic sector are not watching the video of your speech!’, because they are going to say to themselves: ‘Is this the Europe that is supposed to be protecting me?’. For years, we have been told that the fight against climate change, renewable energy objectives, green industry and the green economy would be pillars of European growth and the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, what are we seeing? We are seeing European institutions that are, in part, petrified by China, and which are taking months and months to potentially react or take provisional measures. How can we justify to these workers, and to all those who are fighting for Europe to protect industry and protect workers, the fact that the United States have, in the space of a few weeks, taken strong measures, imposing import tariffs of up to 250 %, while in Europe, we finally got around to opening an investigation in September and may have provisional measures by July, or failing that, by the end of the year?</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that First Solar has already closed its sites in Germany; it is true that the news about Q Cells is now history. How many small and medium-sized enterprises are in difficulty today, however? Even if they do not make it into the news, they are in difficulty. Thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs are under threat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee, we urge you to accelerate the process of introducing provisional measures. Europe was a leader, with ambitious goals on renewable energy and a strong renewable energy industry working alongside it. Today, we are losing that industry, while a real trade war is taking place between the United States and China in the strategic sector of renewable energy, which is so crucial to our competitiveness and our future energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It seems that today, the European Union has once again opted to wait indefinitely. At this rate, the decision will be taken by default. When there is no European photovoltaic industry left, there will no longer be any point in taking measures: you will be able to rest at ease!</p>

The problem lies in the excessive public support for the purchase of electricity produced by these renewable sources. On the one hand, state support has brought about incredibly rapid growth in photovoltaic equipment and, on the other hand, this has meant an increase in the production of components by enterprises in Member States. However, in Europe, these have been squeezed out by cheaper imports from China. Some existing companies manufacturing panels have even been closed down, resulting in an increase in unemployment in some regions. As can be seen, there has been a distortion of market principles.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Support for artificially induced demand on the market and the constantly falling price of imported photovoltaic panels with an increase in the price of electrical energy for the population has created a need to resolve this situation and the realisation that the solution needs to be very quick. The dispute between the European Union and China in trade relations with respect to imported panels should therefore be resolved by agreement and cooperation so that there are no market problems and this is a really important matter with high time pressure for a solution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel ashamed. While enterprises are closing and workers being made redundant, you come here and tell us we are the most open market in the world and that this investigation will issue its findings in nine months. Somebody here seems to have forgotten why he is being paid a salary by the European taxpayers. If Mr De Gucht says that the trade war is not China’s fault, that is nonetheless an indication that someone has declared war.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can hardly argue with the fact that many enterprises are closing and laying off their workers, or is this not the case in Brussels? Instead of MEPs, I would like to see here today those workers who have lost their jobs and those businesspeople who have seen 30 or 40 or 50 years of work go up smoke for reasons that are obvious to us all. Does anyone here really doubt that China engages in unfair trade, exploits workers, illegally subsidises its enterprises and ignores environmental issues? Does anyone have any questions that cannot be resolved in nine days rather than nine months?</p>
      <p sl="it">I am ashamed to represent a Europe that by the end of this investigation will have no photovoltaic industry left. For some people, the words ‘import duty’ are taboo. Well then certain people should either impose import duties to get things done, or otherwise resign, because nine months is too long to spend investigating the obvious.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, we should give very careful consideration to the causes and the effect. We are in danger of taking a very short-sighted view of complex economic and social developments and, with populist actions, unleashing a trade war with China. That is the last thing the European Union needs at present!</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, we need fair trade and fair production, but what has actually happened? As a result of cutbacks in the support schemes in Germany and other countries, the photovoltaic market was artificially constricted, resulting in increased competition. If this triggers a major dispute at the political level, we jeopardise the trade links of manufacturers of polysilicon, as well as putting exports in other sectors at risk. We also jeopardise the global supply of technologies that we urgently need for the transformation of our energy systems. Mr Jadot has already highlighted the challenges associated with renewable energies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our discussions about the EU budget and the positions of the EU Member States on drastic budget cuts also have implications for the issue that is the subject of this debate. We cannot achieve a solution through confrontation. We can only do so through cooperation. I would therefore urge the Commission to make arrangements as soon as possible, as time is really pressing, for a joint forum for European, US and Chinese manufacturers and to support networking between developers, producers and distributors in these three key regions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, recent developments in relations between the EU and China in the solar industry are, sadly, symptomatic of the general trade situation between these two partners.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, we are debating, on the one hand, the investigations initiated by the Commission on possible anti-dumping measures, and on the other hand, the reaction from China, which has initiated similar investigations. Action is long overdue. The European solar industry is undoubtedly an important and growing high-tech sector in Europe. In Austria, too, there are leading manufacturers who are safeguarding key jobs in this future-oriented industry and creating new ones.</p>
      <p sl="de">These companies have a crucial role to play in the attainment of our renewable energy targets and must certainly be protected. I have a general suggestion to make about trade relations between the EU and China, for although the feud between the EU and the Chinese solar industry has triggered this ongoing and simmering conflict, it is not the fundamental problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may say so, the solar industry is merely the tip of the iceberg. The main question that I would therefore address to the Commission today is this: to what extent is China generally willing to view Europe as a partner in future? From my perspective, it is clear that the European Union and China must in future be strategic partners who meet on equal terms. It must be a strategic partnership, built on mutual respect and trust. What I believe is missing at present is this mutual respect, and without mutual respect, there can be no trust!</p>
      <p sl="de">Resolute action is needed here at long last. Of course, other questions arise in this context as well: what approach will the Commission pursue in future in order to develop this mutual trust? How can we give more effective protection and support, more generally, to European industries that lead the field globally? No one wants protectionism, but we do need protection and fairness. The photovoltaic industry is vitally important to Europe and, as Daniel Caspary has already said, the industry is now in dire straits. Even so, it is still creating thousands of jobs directly and indirectly and embodies European know-how. That is why we must ensure that the rights steps are taken. Europe must show its strength here at last.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that on your travels around Europe in this difficult period – especially given your competencies in some key areas at this time of crisis – you will have had a chance to ‘see for yourself’ the situation in which Europe finds itself. I say this because the last thing I would like in the present case is to find myself agreeing with Mr Salvini.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must be aware of the situation we face: we know that China represents a great opportunity, and not simply great problem. It represents an opportunity for those enterprises that export EUR 170 billion worth of goods to China each year, although we also import EUR 250 billion and are only too aware that this represents a trade deficit. However, if we do not introduce strict and exact rules on fair trade, we will end up by fuelling and increasing the wave of anti-European sentiment against the EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">What else do we need to say or do to make you understand in that ivory tower that is the European Commission what kind of situation we are facing? These continuous sermons on innovation and development mean very little to the sector we are dealing with here, which is at the cutting edge in terms of innovation and development! So all of you, and all of the gnomes that live inside the offices of the Commission, cannot but be aware that the timetables that you are proposing do not do justice to Europe and the problems we are facing!</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that you should make an effort to understand that for the largest economic power in the world to impose the rules of fair trade simply means enhancing its own dignity, showing that it understands how to live within the great global village of the present with a sense of dignity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Currently Europe is not managing to do this in a way that benefits its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important decision. The debate has become quite heated but that is because the industrial and employment situation in our countries is extremely difficult. This is an important decision in both real and symbolic terms, since we are dealing with a matter of principle. We must send out a sign of legality and respect in view of the all of the efforts being made by our business world. When I say ‘our world’, I do not mean it in a protectionist sense; I mean that the business community looks to the decision-making in Strasburg and Brussels with a feeling of belonging, searching for guarantees that only the Commission, Parliament, our institutions, can provide for fairer trade.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we must tread cautiously: this is also a business world that looks at China as a great export opportunity, and that in certain sectors is actually managing to stay afloat precisely because of the market it has managed to develop in China. Thus we are not attempting to be protectionist and raise barricades. We simply do not want to be deceived, especially in an area such as photovoltaics, so crucial for our sustainable future.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, Commissioner, we must try to speed up this investigation so that any compensation can be estimated and claimed much sooner than planned. Moreover, since all of this debate is really about what to do in the wake of something that has already happened, we must also work on prevention. We should therefore strengthen the bilateral agreements to avoid any repeat of this kind of situation with China or other countries in future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Chinese technology is advancing rapidly and is now the equal of world leaders in many sectors.</p>
      <p sl="sk">One of the areas where Chinese production is clearly provoking fear among competing manufacturers in the US and Europe is the production of solar panels, which Chinese manufacturers are able to sell at a substantially better price than our companies. Instead of using the better prices of Chinese solar panels for a massive expansion of this photovoltaic source of green energy in Europe, we are allowing lobbyists from the Solarvol AG company to push for the introduction of tariff barriers, the result of which will simply be that this technology once again becomes inaccessible due to price. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that in this case we must decide whether we wish to meet our ecological targets set out in the Strategy 2020 and encourage the most rapid and effective expansion of renewable sources of energy or to protect the profits and economic interests of companies which are unable to compete honestly with the substantially cheaper and more accessible Chinese products.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the number of speakers on the list shows the importance that we attach to this issue. Generally speaking, there is agreement across party lines, as is already apparent. There are merely differences on points of detail. In principle, I welcome the existence of our trade defence instruments. That goes without saying. However, we must ensure that these measures are proportionate.</p>
      <p sl="de">The technical anti-dumping procedures that we have available should not be misused for political ends or deployed for protectionist purposes. We all understand that Europe’s success depends on open markets. That is nothing new, but it is a principle which continues to hold good in times of crisis. The anti-dumping procedure against China in respect of solar cells has the potential to escalate into a fully fledged trade war, and that is something which we avoid as a matter of urgency, for this cannot be in our interests. Indeed, since the end of October, the Chinese have initiated an anti-dumping procedure in another sector and our industry will suffer as a result of that as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore urge the Commission to take action as a matter of urgency, through bilateral talks, to resolve this impending trade war and find a global solution for the industry as a whole. I ask you this: has the Commission – as called for by Chancellor Merkel – already attempted to make a direct approach to the Chinese Government in order to defend the interests of Europe’s solar industry at the highest level? Dialogue could also be a way forward here.</p>
      <p sl="de">As my last point, I would like, if I may, to draw your attention to points 4 and 5 of our oral question. At a time of crisis, we need a common industrial strategy and that, if I may so say, is an area where policy initiatives and impetus do not appear to be forthcoming from the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in a relatively short time, the economies of the European Union and China have reached impressive levels of inter-dependence. Currently, trade between the two partners is worth approximately EUR 1 billion a day, the second largest amount in the world.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Despite China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001, its commercial relations with the European Union are still characterised by barriers to trade in goods and services, such as difficult market access for economic operators, restrictions on exports of raw materials, and the use of subsidies and dumping.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As highlighted by the Commissioner, the Commission has begun to respond to complaints by European companies, and two investigations regarding the sale of photovoltaic panels sold at artificially low prices are now in progress. Estimates show that these products are sold at up to 80 % less than the production price. The European Union gains considerably from its relationship with China; however, this type of behaviour affects the competitiveness of European companies in a climate in which the European Union must promote and support employment within its own industries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union’s relations with China must be strengthened, but they also must be based on reciprocity and respect for trade laws. Like other Members, I would ask you, Commissioner, to speed up the ongoing investigation and, in order to protect European workers and entrepreneurs, develop an industrial strategy, as the previous speaker suggested.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it feels a little odd to be debating aid for the photovoltaic panel industry. It is something that we are used to discussing, but in the sense that Europe should give more support to the development and research of photovoltaic panel production in Europe. Now, instead, we are criticising China for appearing to have given too much support to its industry.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If we decide to introduce these anti-dumping duties, they may be the biggest anti-dumping duties we have ever introduced. It is therefore important to be very careful and very precise. There is a tremendous amount at stake.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is not only European photovoltaic panel production that is at stake, but also trade relations with China and our energy and climate policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">These are not the only anti-dumping duties that we have for renewable energy. We already have anti-dumping duties on biodiesel, ethanol, right down to the plastic used to make wind farms.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I therefore call on the Commission to carry out the overall assessment that it has been instructed to carry out as part of its investigation, to take Community interests seriously, and to examine what the consequences will be for our energy and climate policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to what has just been said and I must admit that I am worried by the turn of events.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, it is clear that China is flooding the European photovoltaic market with cut-price products, taking advantage of our incentive policies. However, what will happen once all our businesses have gone bust, no longer able to cope with this particularly aggressive competition? I will tell you: the Chinese have a particularly aggressive trade policy which involves annihilating all of their competitors through low prices and then, once they have a monopoly, imposing outrageous price hikes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At this rate, in three or four years’ time, we will no longer have any European producers of photovoltaic panels and the prices of the Chinese panels will be at least 50 % higher than those offered by our industries at present. In short, we have everything to lose by failing to react to behaviour like this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to express my fears, Commissioner, about the reaction of our Chinese friends. No sooner had they learned that the European Commission was going to investigate allegations of subsidy dumping in the photovoltaic sector than they themselves launched an anti-dumping procedure on European silicone, lodging several complaints with the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Should we see this as a form of intimidation? The Chinese investigation will most probably return its results before the Commission, as their legal time limits are shorter, and I join Daniel Caspary and Vincent Jadot in asking the question: what are we going to do if the Chinese authorities conclude that dumping has occurred?</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when we are thinking about the possible modernisation of our trade defence instruments, I think that this situation is a good illustration of the fact that, whatever else we do, we must not reduce them. To do so would be to weaken the Union.</p>

The Chinese export of solar panels to the European Union clearly showed dumping characteristics and the EU must react promptly.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the real problem is all manufactured imports from, and all relocations to, China and other emerging economies. Indeed, the problem lies with ourselves, or rather with yourselves – addicted to neo-liberalism and the economic and political ideology of globalism.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will let you into a secret. China might have transformed itself into a capitalist economy and country but it is not neo-liberal. It competes with us with artificially depressed wage levels, which not only reduce costs, but also prevent the development of a market for imports from the West. Flagrant patent violations, 19th century working conditions, cheap state loans and subsidies and a grossly under-valued currency.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the Members for their very substantive interventions, and also for their overall support on this very important issue for European competitiveness, European industry, European workers and European citizens. The standards applied by the Commission in trade defence matters are among the highest in the world. We practise a fact-based trade policy in defence of European economic and social interests, and in the interests of the competitiveness and sustainability of the European economy and European industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">As in all cases, the Commission will thoroughly and objectively assess the facts presented by all economic operators concerned, in order to come to an impartial assessment of the need for trade defence remedies.</p>
      <p sl="en">With specific reference to registration, the complainants have formally asked for the registration of imports before the adoption of provisional measures. The Commission is currently considering whether this request meets the legal conditions enshrined in the basic anti-dumping regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the speed of the procedure, the Commission formally received a complaint from the industry at the end of July 2012 and took the next steps as early as September 2012. That was done rapidly and expediently. We are bound by legal deadlines imposed by the WTO and by EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The speed of a case is determined by its complexity and size, as well as by the need to carry out investigations properly and accurately, in order to ensure the maximum effectiveness of further measures. Rest assured that my colleague, Commissioner Karel De Gucht, is fully aware of your concerns. I will pass them on to him, and he will recommend appropriate action to the Commission with the best interests of EU industry firmly in mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">Trade defence instruments are part and parcel of the Commission’s toolkit to keep international trade fair and, where necessary, to improve market access abroad for EU exports. We can use WTO channels, as we have done, including during the present Commission mandate. I will pass on other specific concerns as well to Commissioner De Gucht.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as for the renewable energy sector, the European Union will continue to pursue fair and liberalised trade globally. While you would prefer this to happen under the WTO framework, the Commission is also open to a multilateral agreement on renewable energies, such as the proposed sustainable energy trade agreement. I am referring to many interventions in today’s debate. You also see that our bilateral trade agreements will also tackle both tariff and non-tariff barriers in the renewable energy sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also working specifically on the promotion of this relatively new sector through the Renewable Energy Directive, which was adopted in 2009. This directive has established a regulatory framework that has been conducive to technological development, cost reductions and innovation through economies of scale. Europe must indeed be in the front line of developing this very important sector as regards the greening of our industries and as regards our being in the leadership role in the next and current industrial revolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you called for a joint industrial strategy. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that just a few weeks ago, in October 2012, the Commission adopted a communication on an integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era which focuses on competitiveness and sustainability of European industry. It outlines a very important policy debate, which I trust will also be conducted in this House. We have to do everything we can in order to ensure competitiveness and a strong future for European industry, for European workers and for European Union citizens.</p>

No matter what anti-dumping measures the European Commission decides upon, in practice, these measures are regularly circumvented by Chinese exporters, which, for example, route their goods through Taiwan in order to avoid import tariffs. The case of solar panels is a particularly symbolic one, but since the start of 2012 I have on several occasions supported French businesses from different sectors, all confronted with the same problem. I call upon the European Commission to further intensify its relations with the Chinese authorities, because our companies can no longer be satisfied with partial measures and sector-specific agreements.

      <p sl="en">At the beginning of this week, a staff level agreement was reached between the EU-IMF Troika and the Greek authorities. The long meeting of the Eurogroup, which lasted from Tuesday night until Wednesday morning, saw substantial progress towards an agreement on Greece, even if a definitive conclusion ultimately proved elusive this time. Importantly, the Eurogroup recognised that the Greek authorities have successfully implemented the full set of prior actions agreed with the EU and the IMF. This is the result of a very substantial and strong effort on the part of Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of structural reforms, important decisions have been taken to build a more effective and efficient tax administration. That is indeed crucial, because a fair sharing of the tax burden is a question not only of sound public finances, but equally of social justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we should move beyond the myth that no progress has been made in Greece or by Greece. That perception is damaging and unfair. Honourable Members, Greece is delivering. Now it is time for Greece’s European and international partners to deliver their part of the agreement.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">To do that, the euro area Member States need to agree to decide on a credible set of measures to restore Greece’s debt sustainability. The discussions on Tuesday night moved us very close to an agreement. In this context, we should be clear that this set of measures does not exclude the need to reassess the debt sustainability of Greece in the coming years, and it does not exclude taking further decisions as necessary in the light of future developments – depending, of course, on the full implementation of the reform programme by Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I trust that everyone will reconvene in Brussels next Monday with the necessary constructive spirit and move beyond the detrimental mindset of red lines. Frankly, I see no reason why we should not be able to conclude the package and do away with the uncertainty which has been holding back a return of confidence in Europe and of investment and growth in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, Europe stands by Greece. I can assure you that my services are working flat out to make this happen, and that the Commission will leave no stone unturned in order to facilitate this essential agreement for the European economy and for the Greek people.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, this coming Sunday is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Unfortunately, violence against women is still a daily reality and is taking place on an alarming scale everywhere in the world, including the European Union. Violence against women does not respect social, cultural and geographical borders. It is estimated that at least one woman in five in Europe has experienced domestic violence at some time in their lives. Let me make it clear: what we are talking about here is appalling physical violence, and psychological and sexual abuse. This situation is completely unacceptable. Let me quote the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Article 1 states: ‘Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected.’ Article 3 states: ‘Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity.’</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This House recently adopted legislation for a European Protection Order and minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. These are important steps, but there is still a lot to do. We have a responsibility to campaign for an end to this violence. It is something we must work for together, men and women. That means implementing the existing policy measures and safeguarding the financial resources that are required. The EU institutions, the Member States and civil society must work together in order to develop a global strategy to combat violence against women.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Committee on Fisheries believes that we, as a Parliament, have no alternative but to stand up to the unacceptable behaviour of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council. Successive Presidents, for the last three years, have completely ignored the role of the European Parliament as a co-legislator in matters relating to multiannual plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Multiannual plans, as we all know, are a pillar of the common fisheries policy. These plans are vitally important in terms of protecting fisheries resources and ensuring the livelihood of communities dependent on fisheries. So we, as a directly elected body of the European Union, and the Council of Ministers together share a joint responsibility as co-legislators. The Council of Ministers must wake up to the responsibilities and respect the Treaty of Lisbon and the citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">So on behalf of the Fisheries Committee, I request the final vote to be deferred under Rule 177(4) of the Rules of Procedure. I would hope that this may be the first of many reports on which the Parliament may have to take a firm stance against the Council until they are willing to enter into meaningful talks so as to resolve this dispute which has been going on for three years.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the practice of ‘finning’ is unacceptable from an environmental point of view because it threatens the sustainability of some shark species targeted by this practice, from the social and economic point of view because it involves squandering a source of food with commercial value, and also from the moral point of view because it shows a total disrespect for animal life. Although finning has since 2003 been banned in European waters and by the European fleet, the Commission has decided to present a proposal to end the derogation from the ban on removing shark fins on board EU fishing vessels. This proposal increases the protection necessary for sharks and will allow the EU to make an active contribution to global efforts to eradicating the cruel practice of finning in other parts of world, too.</p>

Overall the proposal aims at placing 10 regulations under the legal framework of the Lisbon Treaty. This will enhance common commercial policy. Further economic growth depends on empowering the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts on common commercial policy. Strengthening common commercial policy will enhance economic growth, as the Commission is responsible for making all Member States follow these regulations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I support the rapporteur’s opinion that the European Parliament and the Council should be able to oppose delegated acts that affect important aspects of legislation at any time. Nevertheless, in order to keep up with technological development and changes in the field, the delegated acts procedure is the best instrument, provided it includes the consultation of all relevant stakeholders. The current proposal is a good solution to maintaining the global competitiveness of the Union. With the current economic climate, the common commercial policy must bring benefits for the Union and its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, fish stocks are limited resources. In this respect the technical conservation measures for fishery resources are among the key elements of an approach to fisheries management and we need to regionalise the approach. I take note of the Commission’s proposal extending the rules on technical measures for another transitional period, but additional changes are necessary to complete the update. For instance, there is a need to readjust areas where cod, haddock and whiting fishing is banned. However, I regret that the Commission’s proposal is again on transitional technical measures. The fishermen need clear legal clarity and cannot continue to base their activities on temporary measures. I call on the Commission to submit a permanent solution on technical measures as soon as possible.</p>

I also voted against those amendments that would extend the existing loopholes in the ban on removing sharks’ fins and that proposed the implementation of expensive methods that have proved ineffective. The approach of ensuring that fins are naturally attached has been in force and has proved itself over a long period of time in many countries such as the US and Australia, and most Member States of the European Union do not allow sharks’ fins to be removed on board vessels. The EU’s provisions cannot allow any derogations from that ban. Thank you.</p>

Now, at European level at least, we have a regulation that no longer permits any exemptions.</p>

In my view, we have spoken for every person in Europe by voting by such a large majority to prohibit shark finning today.</p>

The fins are the most valuable part of the shark because they are the ingredients for soup, which is a lucrative business, but this practice cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

In fact, a ban has been in place in Europe since 2003, but there were a great many exemptions.

The practice of finning, whereby fishermen capture sharks, cut off their fins and dump the rest of the animal into the ocean, cannot be accepted.

      <p sl="en">In Britain we have already made it illegal to practise shark finning on British registered vessels, and it is surely time now for the EU to meet the standards set by many other countries worldwide. There must therefore be no further loopholes and no derogation specifically aimed at Spanish and Portuguese fishermen on this issue. Furthermore, we should also look more closely at the notion of overfishing of certain species of sharks, which threatens to bring about the extinction of these species, which have been alive and well and thriving in our oceans for over a million years.

It involves the removal shark fins at sea and throwing the shark back into the sea where it generally suffers a cruel and painful death.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr President. As things stand at present, the enlargement process is not just an opportunity for Europe’s continued economic development, but perhaps most importantly, it is also an opportunity to enhance the security of European countries, especially in the key Balkan region. The countries of that region are making steady progress, bringing their legislation into line with the Union’s provisions. I trust that the remaining countries will soon follow Croatia and accede to the Union. I should also like to recall the need for further commitment to enlargement policy towards the East. The situation of Ukraine is particularly important for Poland. Ukraine is one of our largest neighbours, and therefore has a significant impact on relations in the area. In addition, it is important to actively encourage the new Georgian Government, to ensure it implements its declared policy of maintaining the country’s pro-European stance. I believe that the support for enlargement contained in the report and the proposed actions aimed at building public confidence in that idea are entirely relevant and fully in line with the interests of the citizens of the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, enlargement policies and criteria must be tailored to the needs of the candidate and potential candidate countries, and also to the needs of their citizens, as well as responding to the criteria and principles of the Union. Therefore, it is important to pay greater attention to the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and fraud at an early stage. This is why I welcome the Commission’s decision to open Chapters 23 and 24 early on in the accession process and to work on the basis of concrete, detailed benchmarks. Also, a lesson learned is that enforcement is the key to fulfilling these conditions. To remain credible, the accession process must be merit-based, tailored, benchmark-driven and transparent.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High-Level Accession Dialogue with Macedonia is a good initiative, but this does not and should not replace the accession process. We are to judge Macedonia on its merits; the country surely deserves to start the accession negotiations now.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, 20 years after the Copenhagen conference, we have an economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We have to say what the European Union has brought for the accession countries. The EU is without doubt a successful project. It has achieved great changes in people’s lives, but the crisis facing us imposes new roles. We must talk more about what values a common Europe has brought to people, and also more about the scope of solidarity. We must also talk about the social challenges, since this dimension is of the utmost importance. Many of us would not be here today were it not for enlargement. Enlargement has contributed to peace, stability and prosperity in the EU. Human rights and freedoms are the basis for the rule of law. Enlargement is beneficial for the entire EU, bringing it a better standing in the resolution of global problems and therefore I have supported the resolution and the conditions which should enhance the credibility and effectiveness of enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The entire accession process should define transparent and fair benchmarks, creating concrete steps towards accession, which would not be called into question, since it would be the consequence of clear, concrete and measurable objectives.</p>

Let me add my voice to others: Macedonia needs high-level talks and I welcome the fact that these have now been initiated, but that should not stop us from doing our utmost to end the Greek blockade against this country, preferably before the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards Kosovo, I regret that bureaucracy has prevailed and the reference to UN Security Council Resolution 1244 has been retained in a footnote. Kosovo is now an independent European country which has been recognised by the majority of EU Member States, and it is high time that the five countries which have not yet done so finally recognised Kosovo, so that it can move towards visa-free travel and a trade agreement with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me make one last point, if I may. I am also critical of the highly euphemistic statements made in this report about Turkey. Accepting Turkey as an accession candidate was a mistake. Turkey is not a European country and it does not fulfil the criteria.</p>

This means that there should be no rockets from Gaza into Israel – on the one hand – but it also means that Israel needs to stop its bombardment of Gaza and also ensure that there are no extrajudicial assassinations by Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we need to ensure that the ceasefire leads to a lasting peace, otherwise we will be here again in a few months or in a few years. That is why I was particularly happy to co-sign and sponsor this motion, which sets out a roadmap for a lasting solution. It calls for an end to the Gaza blockade, and it reiterates EU support for the two-state solution, recognising Palestine’s right to statehood and also acknowledging that Israel has the right to live peacefully within its borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was particularly pleased with the vote today recognising Palestine’s bid for UN membership. I call on all EU Member States to acknowledge the vote in the European Parliament, and to speak with one voice and support the Palestinian bid for observer status in the UN.</p>

As regards the peace process in the Middle East, we have repeatedly supported the view that Israel and Palestine have the right to coexist as independent states. We have also expressed our firm commitment to security in that unstable region.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the current context, we must reiterate our appeal for an end to the use of force and a resumption of peace talks. The continuing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas must be strongly condemned. The same applies to the illegal arming of Palestinians from outside. The Tel Aviv Government was forced into taking measures to counter Palestinian aggression in order to defend its citizens. As I endorse the motion, I declare myself in favour of the existence of two independent and democratic states with Jerusalem as their capital. At the same time, I wish to express my solidarity with the Israeli people who have been the victims of brutal aggression, and to condemn to activities of Palestinian extremists. I do not therefore support the call to end the blockade of the Gaza Strip.</p>

Firstly, I believe that we should in future attach conditions to the EUR 600 million that the European Union provides every year as assistance to the region, and that applies to both parties. Everything that has been said applies, of course, to both parties equally.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point is this. It should be made clear to Israel that imprisoning millions of people behind barbed wire and walls that are several metres high does not work in the long term. The GDR, which has vanished from the map, is the classic example. It does not work. The only way forward is to engage in talks with the partner, even if the partner concerned is regarded as less than ideal. In my view, there will be no option but to talk to Hamas, for example, sooner or later. Austria has a strong tradition here. I recall that Austria and Bruno Kreisky were criticised when we talked to Arafat and Fatah. With hindsight, however, it proved to be the right move and culminated in the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. The same must surely apply today!</p>

Like most of my colleagues and most citizens of the European Union, the agreement on a truce fills me with cautious optimism. I am nevertheless unable to support the proposed Article 5 of the resolution, which deviates sharply from the overall tone of the resolution. If we are talking about seeking a compromise solution, with which both sides in the conflict will be able to live, we cannot also support the claims of one of the sides. This is not a responsible and balanced approach, this is not the way to a peaceful solution. National sovereignty for the territory inhabited by the Palestinians may be the incentive for attempts to live together in peace, not the starting point for negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for eight days the people of Gaza suffered under a horrific Israeli onslaught. It took the lives of almost 150 Palestinians, the majority of whom were civilians, and a number of whom were children. From the Nobel Peace Prize winners – Obama and the EU – we had the usual support for the right-wing Israeli narrative that this was about Israel’s right to protect its population, as a statement of the Foreign Affairs Council of the EU declared. This onslaught had nothing to do with the security of ordinary Israelis and everything to do with the interests of that right-wing Israeli establishment seeking to increase support in advance of January’s general election and seeking to disrupt the attempt to get UN recognition for Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the announcement of the ceasefire, which does mean that the people of Gaza could sleep last night without bombardment, but a lasting peace will only be achieved when there is an end to the national oppression of the Palestinian people and fundamental socialist change in the region in the interests of all working-class people. It is the Palestinian masses struggling from below, linking up with Israeli workers and poor, who can achieve that.</p>

We hope that this will be a long-term agreement, and a push to renew negotiations on long-term peace and a final agreement on the two states in this region. In my opinion, the resolution’s text is balanced.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It deplores the high number of civilian casualties and condemns the attacks against Israel and its civilian population by Hamas and other militias. Israel has the right to defend itself. Any aggression deliberately directed at the civilian population is unacceptable. I voted against paragraph 5, which supports Palestine’s aim to become an observer state of the United Nations. I definitely support Palestinian statehood but unilateral steps and obtaining recognition indirectly does not lead anywhere. An agreement needs to be reached with the neighbour.</p>

There is therefore an urgent need to work towards a durable and peaceful solution for the region at last. That must be based on recognition of Israel’s right to exist and its security interests, which must continue to be safeguarded and defended without any reductions, and of the rights of the Palestinians to form their own state. In other words, what is needed is a two-state solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although this issue is dealt with very well in paragraph 3 and the resolution itself is very good overall, I voted against paragraph 5. I am in favour of Palestine being integrated progressively into UN structures, but sadly, we have a long way to go before that can happen. I believe that this was quite the wrong signal to send out just as the Hamas-controlled areas launched thousands of rockets over Israel. What we want is a peace settlement first.

In the Western Balkans our engagement contributed to peace and security. Today’s Western Balkans still face serious challenges related to the rule of law, the protection of minorities and the fight against organised crime and corruption. The EU must be able to respond to these challenges and to the geopolitical changes taking place on the international scene. This is why we must reassess our security strategy, be more autonomous and show greater unity. More independence does not mean that existing alliances will be put aside. On the contrary, strong transatlantic relations will be further reinforced. The time has come for an ambitious Common Security and Defence Policy with the appropriate means.</p>

The Union must find a way to confirm its strategic independence through a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy, making it possible to act independently, if necessary. Defence capabilities have been greatly affected by the economic crisis, but the EU security policy cannot be left to others. There must be the political will here. In order to fulfil this, the Commission and the Council must precisely define the strategic interests of the EU and set them so as not only to maintain current, existing defence alliances and links in a context of changing threats, but above all to create the prerequisites for building up our own capabilities to be able to respond to the development of threats.</p>

      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, I believe that it is in Britain’s interest to remain pragmatically engaged with CSDP operations when it can bring additional resources to bear. I am the rapporteur for the Horn of Africa and accept that the EU NAVFOR Atalanta mission, which fights piracy in the Indian Ocean, together with the EU training mission in Uganda, are proving useful. I will be watching with interest the mission to Mali with ECOWAS to see what it can do to stabilise the Sahel region, as well as the EULEX mission, which is a civilian mission to Kosovo.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, those who consider or claim that the human rights situation in Kazakhstan is improving should take note of the statement issued two days ago by the official representative of the Prosecutor-General. In this statement they accuse the unregistered opposition of extremist actions and say they filed a lawsuit to ban them, together with a host of independent and media outlets such as the newspapers Respublika and Vzglyad, the satellite television station K+ and dozens of associated online news sites. It is clear that the situation in Kazakhstan with regard to human rights has gone from bad to worse. With the effective banning of opposition parties and the media, Kazakhstan is most likely to see another wave of arrests followed by unfair trials and long prison sentences. This is intolerable and unacceptable. In addition, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the opposition party ALGA who was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, lost his appeal three days ago. Human Rights Watch had declared that Kozlov’s conviction is unsound given that the charges against him are vague and overbroad and are fundamentally incompatible with human rights treaties Kazakhstan has signed. In addition, Vadim Kuramshin, the well known human rights defender, faces up to fourteen years in prison.</p>
      <p sl="en">I make an urgent call here today for the immediate suspension of the negotiations on the enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement unless there is a profound and proven change in the human rights situation in Kazakhstan. This in my view must include an unconditional amnesty for all prisoners convicted on political grounds, including Vladimir Kozlov and Vadim Kuramshin. I call on the international trade union movement and civil society organisations to echo this call and to put pressure on European institutions and on Catherine Ashton, who will visit Kazakhstan next week, to make it crystal clear that there can be no business as usual with the Nazarbayev regime.

It is therefore very much in our interest to take appropriate steps to bring Astana closer to Europe. The partnership and cooperation agreement will facilitate the development of a comprehensive framework for mutual economic development. At the same time, it is also important to encourage the Kazakh authorities to accede to the World Trade Organisation as soon as possible. The partnership must of course encompass issues such as the principles of the rule of law, good governance and democratisation, because these are the mechanisms on which European policy is based.

We must also focus efforts on helping the Kazakh Government to develop its infrastructure in this vast country.

      <p sl="sk">In 2010, the action plan for salmon came to an end. It had been adopted in 1997 by the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission. The contracting parties to the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) have urged the EU to draw up a long-term plan to manage the breeding of the common salmon. The objective of Directive 2000/60/EC establishing a framework for European Union action in the field of water policy is to protect, preserve and improve the aquatic environment in which the salmon spends part of its life-cycle. The multiannual plan for the common salmon population in the Baltic Sea should contribute to achieving the objectives of the above mentioned Directive. Essential measures, such as the management of river basins should not be duplicated in this regulation, but it is necessary to coordinate and unify the measures adopted pursuant to this regulation and the measures pursuant to the above mentioned Directive for the protection and improvement of the salmon biotope in inland waters. Scientific recommendations lead one to believe that genetic contamination of the common salmon population may lead to a fall in the survival and incidence of the original population and impairment of the genetic ability to overcome disease and changes in local and environmental conditions. Since protection of the genetic integrity and diversity of the common salmon population plays a vital role in its preservation, I am convinced that it should form part of the multiannual plan as one of its objectives.</p>

Over the years, many of these spawning populations have decreased dramatically or even become extinct. Pollution, habitat destruction, hydro-electric dams and other man-made problems have been responsible for declines in population abundance. It is therefore necessary to ensure proper conservation of salmon stocks and fisheries management and to lay down clear rules to unify the principles applying to the management and control of recreational fishing.

One of the reasons for falling stocks is over-fishing of salmon. In order for salmon protection to be effective, recreational fishing should also fall within the scope of regulation.

Salmon is not entirely a competence of the EU, since its spawning areas are the rivers and streams of the MS, but several EU management measures exist - total allowable catches for Sea fishing, minimum landing sizes, closed seasons, etc. There is also a ban on the use of driftnets to catch salmon. The COM has proposed an EU-wide management plan, which by and large we welcomed. Both in ENVI (Carl Schlyter opinion) and in FISH we tried to strengthen the proposal, by phasing out fishing on the Sea, introducing a larger minimum landing size for both salmon and trout (to prevent mis-reporting), increasing the objectives for natural spawning of salmon in wild rivers, etc. A number of our main proposals were accepted (more in ENVI than in FISH, of course) but we lost on the phasing out of fishing on the Sea itself and the common minimum landing size for salmon and trout. We were successful in improving the scope of the plan to include recreational fishing, a major part of the fishing mortality that until now has not been regulated (at EU level).</p>

These measures are aimed at protecting spawning populations that have decreased dramatically in relative terms.

There is a high risk that the large number of farmed fish released annually in the Baltic Sea could affect the genetic integrity of the wild salmon population. I believe that fish stock renewal must be tightly regulated. The conditions governing the sourcing of genetic material for salmon reproduction and the stock renewal procedures could be specified in the multiannual plan so that stock renewal does not have a negative impact on genetic biodiversity.

The definition of trade partners and objectives that should guide trade is an important instrument of economic sovereignty. Removing this instrument has resulted, for Portugal, in serious harm to many economic sectors and to the country as a whole. Trade policy has come to be guided by the maximisation of profit for the large economic groups in the EU’s major powers, clearly to the detriment of countries such as Portugal and to weaker economic sectors, which have been exposed to fierce and destructive competition. Free trade has been one of the CCP’s main instruments, which has sent this policy towards a logic of capitalist competition, instead of complementarity and mutual benefit.

In order to ensure consistency with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is necessary to carry out a review of the legislation in force, which was not adapted to the regulatory process prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.

The proposal seeks to adapt a number of trade policy regulations to the new primary law provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. It proposes aligning the regulations with Article 290, which is the first to introduce delegated acts in European law. Pursuant to Article 290, the legislator may delegate to the Commission the task of supplementing or amending certain non-essential parts of regulation acts. The delegation of powers may be revoked by the legislator at any time, and the legislator can then adopt a decision. Moreover, all of the decisions pursuant to a delegated act can be vetoed by the legislator. The Council or the European Parliament may thus oppose any proposed delegated act. The European Parliament’s proposal limits the delegation of powers to the Commission to a period of five years.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on the amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels. I strongly condemn the practice of finning, which involves cutting off sharks’ fins on vessels before throwing their bodies back into the sea, and has been officially banned by the European Union since 2003. However, the complex system which permits the removal of fins within a ‘fin-to-carcass’ weight ratio of 5 % makes simple control and enforcement of the legislation impossible. With this in mind, I support the Commission’s proposal to make it mandatory to use a method whereby the fins remain attached to the carcass in order to fight effectively against finning. This will reduce the number of sharks fished and allow us to preserve an increasingly endangered species.</p>

The IPMA believes that adopting the Commission proposal will cause evident economic harm, which is not justifiable given the current conservation status of resources, and it provides reasons connected with the quality of the fished products (avoiding freezing, thawing and re-freezing of the material) and the damage that this proposal will cause – by jeopardising the good and cooperative relationship between researchers and the sector – to the collection of information needed so that scientists can provide the authorities with opinions to ensure effective fisheries management and thus guarantee the conservation of these resources.

This practice involves removing the fins from pelagic sharks, with the remaining parts of the animal’s body being thrown back into the sea. Finning is unacceptable from the environmental point of view (it threatens the sustainability of some shark species targeted by this practice), and also from the social and economic point of view (it involves squandering a source of food with commercial value) and from the moral point of view (it shows a total disrespect for animal life). I consider it essential that the practice of shark finning should be repudiated unequivocally, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that this practice is banned in European waters. It was against this background, with the express aim of preventing this practice, that the European Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on 26 June 2003, which prohibits the removal of shark fins on board vessels, as well as their retention on board and their transhipment or landing. In spite of the lack of any evidence of finning being practised by the European fleet, the Commission intends to ‘eradicate the horrendous practice of shark finning and protect sharks much better’ through appropriate regulations.</p>

The live animal is then condemned to sink to the bottom and die. This practice is problematic environmentally (it threatens the survival of certain species), economically (it causes enormous waste of a potential food source) and morally (it causes unnecessary suffering to animals). There is no economic need for ‘finning’, as there is a market for shark bodies, which are nevertheless thrown back into the sea for lack of space. Yet the current regulations are not working correctly: many infractions have been reported. I think it is important to close the loophole in the European legislation from 2003, which allows some fishermen to continue to use this technique. This practice is difficult to detect, as the sharks’ bodies and fins may be landed separately, at different ports. It is therefore necessary to ensure that sharks are landed whole. We must make the legislation clearer and stricter, so that this practice is no longer possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document. A Regulation officially prohibits in the European Union the harmful practice of finning, which is removing sharks’ fins on board fishing vessels before throwing the sharks’ bodies back into the sea. The Regulation makes provision, however, for recourse to exemptions for which ‘special permits’ can be obtained. These exemptions have become the rule in two Member States, Spain and Portugal. Effective control of this complicated system whereby finning on board is permitted within the limits of the 5 % fin-to-carcass weight ratio has proved impossible. It is extremely difficult to check whether this requirement is being adhered to, especially when fins and carcasses are landed in different ports. I therefore support this proposal, which is based on the naturally attached fins method. This method is the only valid way of restricting finning and ensuring that Members States are able to comply with the regulation in a simple, effective and inexpensive manner.</p>

However, the fishing sector has been in serious crisis for many years now, as a result of which the small-scale fishing community is in danger of disappearing in a number of Member States. The requirements this proposal for a regulation imposes will create even more losses in this sector, increasing the risk that this industry will vanish altogether, as only large vessels will be able to afford to carry the whole animal, while small vessels will be unable to meet this requirement.

      <p sl="it">I fully agree with this report on the removal of shark fins, and I have also received suggestions from some non-governmental organisations devoted to shark protection. I think that the simultaneous landing of shark parts is an inadequate response to the current problems, because finning could go on unnoticed even were rules on matching fins to shark bodies to be applied rigorously, which would in any case be a difficult, expensive and laborious method. Furthermore I think that the proposal to raise the fin-to-carcass weight ratio to 14 % of processed weight would result in an unprecedented slackening of controls on finning (since this limit is three times higher than that imposed by most countries who use this system). There is another problem: given the high volume of fish landed, counting fins and matching them to carcasses would complicate rather than improve application. Traceability is a much simpler matter if the attached fins rule is applied. ‘Independent’ control systems are costly and could involve the risk of inaccuracies. Claims by industrial fisheries with regard to possible economic losses are hasty and superficial, have not been subject to external checks and appear to be arbitrary and inconsistent.</p>

These practices should be prohibited as a matter of principle and the closure of the legal loophole is long overdue. The time has come to introduce legislation requiring that all sharks landed by EU flagged vessels operating in EU and non-EU waters and by non-EU vessels in maritime waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States be landed with their fins naturally attached. I therefore especially welcome the abolition of the exemptions under the previous EU regulation, which allowed fishermen who held special permits to remove the fins from sharks on board and land the separated fins in port. There is a massive demand for shark fin because such high prices for shark fin soup can be commanded in the Asian market. This economic incentive, sadly, is causing the killing of sharks for their fins alone. Perhaps the vote of the European Parliament will help to curb this barbaric killing of sharks.</p>

Furthermore, a strict control mechanism should be established in order to close legal loopholes and address difficulties associated with the use of a fin to carcass ratio. Above all, we need to narrow the derogation currently applied and ensure compliance with the obligation to land fins and carcasses together in the same port.

New legislation will mean that all sharks will have to be landed with their fins naturally attached, rather than carcasses being discarded into the sea. I welcome the move to make sure that, where local authorities are unable to carry out controls in ports, vessel owners will be responsible for hiring an independent body to do the job. This legislation bring the rest of Europe up to speed with measures already in force in the UK which put a stop to this wasteful, cruel practice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for this resolution, which aims to revise the legislation applicable to the practice of ‘finning’, the removal of sharks’ fins on fishing boats. This practice was already banned by Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 of 26 June 2003. However, Article 4 of that Regulation provided for an exception which effectively allowed finning. The new resolution puts an end to this barbaric practice, carried out for the purpose of soup production in Asia. Indeed, as the rest of the shark’s body is of lesser commercial value, the still-live shark is often thrown back into the sea, its fins amputated. Incapable of moving in order to oxygenate its gills, the shark therefore slowly asphyxiates. Today, 73 species of sharks which play a vital role in the ecosystem are endangered, as finning has led to overfishing. I am therefore glad that all of the amendments that aimed to reintroduce exemptions have been rejected, as there is now proof that they have been used to circumvent the legislation. At a time when the legislation on red tuna is demonstrating its effectiveness, it is time for everyone to adopt a responsible approach to species that are in real danger.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the strengthening of the rules on the removal of sharks’ fins on board boats. The existing rules permitted exemptions that meant that compliance with the ban on this cruel practice, which involves throwing live sharks back into the sea having removed their fins, could not be guaranteed. While sharks’ fins are the main ingredient in a highly-valued Asian soup, the rest of the meat is less sought-after. There is a great temptation to keep only the valuable part of the shark and to throw the rest of the carcass away, leading to overfishing of an animal of which many species are endangered. However, while the requirement that any fins landed must be attached to the body of the animal should facilitate controls, I remain convinced that the lack of resources allocated to these controls – concerning not only shark finning but also other species – remains the central problem with regard to overfishing, causing harm to the environment and to the overwhelming majority of fishermen, who carry out their work in a responsible and courageous way and face unfair competition that flouts all of the rules.</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported this report, which calls for the abolition of loopholes that allow shark finning to continue. Shark finning – the process whereby a shark’s fin is removed on board a fishing vessel and the rest of the shark discarded back into the sea – is illegal under EU law but is still allowed by vessels that have received a special permit. This proposal calls for all EU vessels, and all vessels fishing in EU waters, to be required to land sharks with their fins still attached and it is hoped that, by doing do, the number of shark catches will be reduced. Many shark species are threatened, some are close to extinction. Shark finning is not only thought to be contributing to the decline in shark numbers, it is also cruel as fins are sometimes removed while the shark is still alive. As the EU ranks second in the world for the number of shark catches, we therefore have an important role to play in helping to protect them. The EU has also legally committed to adopt measures aimed at helping to protect sharks and this proposal should go some way to achieving that.</p>

      <p sl="it">‘Finning’ is unacceptable from an environmental point of view because it threatens the sustainability of some shark species targeted by this practice, from the social and economic point of view because it involves squandering a source of food with commercial value, and also from the moral point of view because it shows a total disrespect for animal life. Although finning has been banned since 2003 in European waters and by the European fleet, the Commission has decided to present a proposal aimed at ending the derogation from the ban on removing shark fins on board EU fishing vessels. The proposal will improve the protection of sharks, allowing the EU to make an active contribution to global efforts to eradicate this cruel practice in other parts of the world too.</p>

I support the review of the International Telecommunication Regulations at WCIT-2012 because this represents a good opportunity to improve cooperation between countries in order to raise levels of economic and social development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This resolution aims to ensure that the Council and Commission changes to the International Telecommunication Regulations further the ‘Union’s objective of, and interest in, advancing the internet as a truly public place’, without any reference to the importance of truly universal, democratic and inclusive access. The resolution calls for respect for ‘human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly freedom of expression and assembly’. We agree. It also argues for free market principles and entrepreneurship, and defends more competition with the aim of ‘avoiding a new digital divide’. Concern is expressed that the ‘ITU [International Telecommunications Union] reform proposals include the establishment of new profit mechanisms … driving up prices [and] hampering innovation’. This concern falls short of the necessary rejection of such profit mechanisms and a reversal of these policies, given that some of their harmful effects are recognised. As an alternative, we signed a motion for a resolution, which was regrettably not adopted given that it was the only one to argue that ‘telecommunications and the internet are and should remain public goods, as this is the only way to guarantee universal access to, and democratic control over, them’.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs), to which the 27 EU Member States are signatories, were adopted by the World Administrative Telegraphy and Telephone Conference in Melbourne in 1988 and have not been revised since. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has called a meeting in Dubai from 3 to 14 December 2012, named the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT), to agree to a new text for these ITRs. Some of the ITR reform proposals presented relate to aspects of international telecommunications which clearly fall under the remit of the EU acquis and Union policy, including the relationship between regulatory bodies and independent commercial operators, roaming and personal data protection. In the context of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), a meeting has been held with the aim of preparing a common European position on ITR reform. The European Commission will inform the International Telecommunications Union of the different competences of the European Union and its Member States in these matters.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Climate change has gradually been purely and simply erased from the political and media agenda over a period of many months. However, with a greater degree of consensus than ever, international experts have merely confirmed their most pessimistic fears about changes in the climate. The objective of preventing a two-degree increase by the end of this century already appears to be obsolete. This can only be a matter of regret. The European Union, which is in the vanguard of the environmental battle, must step up its efforts and its attempts to educate others at international meetings. In this respect, the Doha Conference will be another important event, but let us not be naïve.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the joint resolution recognises that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to humanity and thus has to be addressed at international level by all of the parties. Recent scientific findings suggest that the effects of climate change are more rapid and more pronounced than previously predicted, for instance in the Arctic region, and investments in the energy sector very often have a lifetime of 30 years or more and the planning of new projects and policies takes a long time, a situation which accentuates the worldwide urgency to take new steps in the field of energy. The EU should take a leading role in combating climate change and achieve a legally uniting and binding agreement on equity in long-term global mitigation efforts. It is important to note that after 2012, the last year of fast-start finance (USD 30 billion over three years committed in Copenhagen), there is no certainty as to how much climate finance will be delivered. It is worth stressing that the current economic crisis must not be used as a pretext for inaction or for refusing funding for adaptation measures in developing countries.</p>

Our primary and crucial task is to continue our efforts at all levels, even in the bleak circumstances surrounding us, to prevent at least part of the geoclimatic disturbance. At Doha, the planet’s leaders must ‘take the bull by the horns’ and reach substantial, workable decisions, as the resolution proposes, and must sacrifice their short-term growth for the benefit of the environment, because already we are all experiencing the dire consequences of climate change. The Doha Conference, however, must not refer the matter to the next international conference, as usually happens; commitments must be made, with a specific schedule for reducing emissions, and there must be more than vague political talk about reducing them. Besides, ecology and economics can coexist. We must not renew the right to cause destruction for the benefit of the few.</p>

Recent natural disasters, which have affected several countries including Italy, the United States (Hurricane Sandy) and Portugal, and which have resulted in not only tens of victims but also millions of euros in damage, should prompt world leaders to adopt the environmental measures that are vital in order to prevent the average global temperature from continuing to increase, with all too familiar consequences. Although reducing greenhouse gas emissions may have a high cost, this will always be much lower than the consequences of not adopting these measures.

Although we agree with some points, we strongly disagree with others: support for the creation of a global carbon market, with ‘links between the EU emissions trading scheme and other trading schemes’, at a time when the ineffectiveness and perversity of this market-based approach is clearly evident; support for the allocation of an exchange value, by allocating a price to ‘goods and services’ provided by biodiversity, which is halfway towards the commercial exploitation and private appropriation of nature and her resources; and removal, as a result of the vote in plenary, of the reference to patents (meaning that developing countries will not be required to purchase them).

I am of the view that the Doha Conference (COP 18) must build on the momentum achieved in Durban in order to ensure that such a legally binding global agreement remains on track and will be delivered by 2015. Worldwide innovation in the sustainable energy sector (at both production and user level) creates jobs, stimulates economic growth, increases energy independence, and cares for a cleaner world in which climate change is mitigated and sufficient energy supplies ensured.

Climate change, which was denied by many Members a few years ago, must today be one of the main items on the international community’s political agenda if we are to mitigate the disastrous effects it can have. The motion for a resolution stresses the role Parliament must play in the forthcoming talks in Doha, insisting that Parliament must give its consent to agreements with third countries or international organisations. According to the motion for a resolution, the European Union must continue to play a ‘breakthrough’ role with regard to emission reduction policies and objectives in order to alleviate the effects of climate change. This is why I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution.</p>

Consequently, it is very important for the EU to be able to convince its partners throughout the world to take more decisive action to accede to the international agreement. Only if all countries reduce emissions together will we preserve fair competition and avoid changes that devastate all of mankind. In order to address the issue of the negative impact of climate change, we need to find innovative and additional sources of financing.

      <p sl="fr">Let us say it from the outset: with a few days to go until the Doha Conference, the commitments made by the international community to limit global warming to a maximum of 2° C are a long way from being met. The United Nations and the European Union are sounding the alarm: we must act quickly and decisively! Today, like 484 other Members of the European Parliament, I supported a resolution that reminds us that this target is vital for the continued survival of our planet’s inhabitants and ecosystems. The resolution stresses that, in order to be credible, industrialised countries must not only honour their commitments if they wish to help the poorest countries, but also set the bar higher if they want to reduce their carbon footprint by 2020. The hopes of tomorrow rest on a combination of ambitious measures on clean technologies and energy-efficient buildings and transport, and the promotion of green jobs. The European Parliament also underlines the need to create strategic alliances with the key industrialised countries in order to renew the Kyoto Protocol, which expires very shortly, with a view to concluding a new international treaty with quantified targets for 2020.</p>

The current promises to fight climate change are not sufficient to meet the target of limiting the average global temperature increase to 2°C. It is crucial for a new international treaty to be ratified with more ambitious objectives, and for all countries to step up their efforts. To this end, we call on the EU to aim for a 30 % reduction in its emissions by 2020, we stress our support for the inclusion of air transport in the European emissions trading system, and we ask that the issue of emissions from the international maritime transport sector be addressed swiftly. Unfortunately, the likelihood is that no new legally-binding international treaty will enter into force before 2020, which would leave a void after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol at the end of 2012. This must be avoided at all costs, and I call upon all signatory states to come to an agreement on a second commitment period for the current protocol.</p>

This has obscured the fact that these more recent negotiations have in fact produced constructive – if modest – progress. The developments we have seen on issues such as forestry monitoring and reporting and the Clean Development Mechanism are both encouraging and significant. They might not always be headline news, but they show that international cooperation is working and that meaningful progress can be made. We should continue to build on this progress, especially in the area of forestry and financing. Deforestation is one of the single biggest contributory factors to CO2 increases. Effective international forestry management will not only reduce these emissions, but will also help preserve biodiversity and the invaluable eco-services it provides. We do not have to wait for a finalised international agreement on emissions before we put in place concrete measures which will deliver not only CO2 reduction but also wider environmental, economic and societal benefits in the medium and long term.</p>

There should be greater awareness of the urgency of the need for concrete actions, taking into account for example the positive results achieved by the sustainable energy sector, which creates jobs, stimulates economic growth and mitigates climate change.

Can the European Union set the example, starting by honouring its commitments? How close are we to the adoption of binding commitments and actions to reduce CO2 emissions by all Member States? There is cause for scepticism given that the Commission’s targets are for 2050.

In advance of the next Climate Change Conference there is no indication that the US, China or India are prepared to follow Europe’s lead and introduce significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the analysts, even if Europe did away with all its industrial emissions, the global trend would remain unchanged unless the aforementioned countries took action. Furthermore, there is still no rational indication as to whether this trend is the result of human activity or of natural climate change. Once again, I call on the European Parliament to reconsider its stance. That is why I voted against the resolution debated.

International disagreements will be turned into bilateral disputes under the arbitration of the EU, which will undertake to settle them on the basis of its own interests. The EU will intervene with ‘all parties to disputes … to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice or to commit themselves to a binding arbitration mechanism …’, calling upon the Commission and the Council to develop an arbitration mechanism aimed at resolving bilateral and multilateral disputes. The integration process is being used by the EU to impose the Europe 2020 strategy in order to serve the interests of the monopolies.

I would prefer there to be no budget reduction in the enlargement chapter, but understand that this is necessitated by the financial situation. We must therefore better utilise the EU’s resources.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The enlargement of the EU to include new countries, if it is to happen, should stem from a sovereign decision of the people and countries in question, and should respect their right to economic and social development. This report does not guarantee that these requirements will be duly observed, which is why we voted against. In addition, the report affronts principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. The ‘new negotiating approach’ advocated by the report is even more interfering, imposing economic and social models and political system and democracy models that conflict with the people’s right to self-determination in accordance with their own interests and aspirations. The majority in Parliament argue that the ‘EU’s overall interests’ should prevail over the people’s interests and over ‘disputes’ between countries that want to join. In the ‘case of not being able to reach a bilateral agreement’, these countries must commit themselves to a ‘binding arbitration mechanism of their choice’ or, in other words, to an attempt to impose the EU’s interest on sovereignty disputes. This specifically means attempting to force Serbia to accept the Kosovo secession defended by the EU and NATO, and Cyprus to accept Turkey’s accession while the latter continues to occupy the northern part of the former.</p>

These values are the foundation of the European Union itself and guide its action on the international scene, and must be respected and upheld by all Member States. Enlargement has been part of the EU agenda since as early as the 1960s. Since the first enlargement in 1973, the Union has grown gradually, its membership rising from the six founding members to the current 27 (soon to be 28). Enlargement has been a successful process for the EU and Europe as a whole, in helping to overcome the divisions of the cold war, contributing to peace, stability and prosperity throughout Europe, enhancing conflict prevention, stimulating reforms and consolidating freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, as well as the development of market economies and socially and ecologically sustainable development. Twenty years after the Copenhagen summit, which affirmed the membership prospects of the Central and Eastern European Countries and laid down the accession criteria, I believe that the time has come for a re-evaluation of the established procedures and of enlargement policy as a whole, without prejudice to the ongoing negotiation.</p>

It looks rather like caution is being thrown to the wind, as has always been the case prior to the strengthening of Brussels’ powers by a new treaty. It also looks like a hope on the part of pro-Europeans that there is a critical size above which their utopia would be ‘too big to fall and to fail’.

However, at the same time, there is a degree of political vagueness in this report that may cause difficulties with regard to the accession of certain countries.

Over the last decade, we have witnessed two significant enlargements, which have benefited the entire EU, which has become an important world player with a market of almost 500 million. After the outbreak of the economic and financial crisis, however, the Union and its Member States found themselves in an unprecedented situation. The decline in economic growth, increasing national deficits and debt in many Member States became for the EU and its Member States a real test of solidarity and commitment to the basic principles for which the Union stands. In the context of adoption of the budget for 2013 and the financial review for 2014-2020, it therefore annoys me that some countries are abandoning European solidarity among Member States and trying to push through a reduction in the volume of resources for the cohesion policy, which helps to balance inequalities within the EU. Yes, a more effective and prudent enlargement policy might be a valuable strategic instrument for the economic development of the EU and the region, but I am convinced that every effort, including financial resources, must be primarily directed towards the consolidation of economic and financial stability within the EU’s boundaries.</p>

The ambition of membership encourages internal reforms and contributes to the political, economic and even social transformation of those seeking EU membership. Enlargement undoubtedly opens up new opportunities for the whole of the EU and its citizens. Of course, it is not an easy process and we often face some disappointment. However, the text of the EP resolution quite rightly begins with a reference to Article 49 of the of the Treaty on European Union. It is my belief that the door of the enlargement process must not be closed to any European country which expresses a desire for European integration and shows concrete progress. EU enlargement also has another dimension.

However, as is usually the case, not even the enlargement policy can manage without some reforms. In view of the constantly changing internal EU environment, consideration needs to be given to the social and economic indicators and, in the process of enlargement, room must be made for the voice of civil society.

According to the report, candidate and potential candidate countries should have resolved any disputes with their neighbours prior to accession, particularly those concerning territorial issues. My question is this: where is the solution to the Cyprus issue? Indeed, it is the EU that has to foot the bill. This year alone, we paid EUR 860 million to Turkey in so-called pre-accession assistance! The critical situation along the Syrian border highlights the additional dangers associated with Turkish accession. When the European Coal and Steel Community was founded exactly 60 years ago in 1952, its founders’ main aim was to achieve lasting peace in Europe. We simply have to recognise that, as is quite apparent from the present situation, accession by Turkey, which has a border to Syria and is a front-line state in the Middle East conflict, would mean bringing ongoing military conflicts into the heart of the European Union.

This is supported by the experience gained from the accession of eastern European countries. As well as the economic benefits, one should not underestimate the political benefits offered by a single Europe. It goes without saying that the EU should not make any compromises with candidate countries as regards our values and fundamental principles such as respect for human rights and democracy.

      <p sl="fr">I voted against this report on the EU’s enlargement policies and criteria. The report is based on the Copenhagen criteria, which include the objective of ‘a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the EU’. This says all there is to say about the main objective of European integration, and there is no question of my supporting these policies, whose consequences become more visible to us every day. Moreover, I condemn the hypocrisy of this report, which states that enlargement facilitates respect for human rights – the poor relation of the Copenhagen criteria – and particularly their monitoring after accession. If this is the case, how do we explain the impunity enjoyed by Mr Orbán’s Government in Hungary? I deplore the fact that the system for imposing sanctions in the event of a human rights violation, as provided by Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, is totally closed off by the Member States, that its implementation is a matter for the Council alone and that the Council requires unanimity to implement it, which effectively makes the provision entirely unenforceable. To claim to enforce human rights in candidate countries when it is impossible to do so in Member States is intolerable.</p>

At a time when Israel’s criminal war is raging against the Palestinian people, and imperialist intervention by the US, NATO and the EU is in full swing in Syria, the majority in the European Parliament condemns the Palestinians’ attacks on Israel! It does not say a word about Israel’s murderous bombing of Palestinian civilians. It does not call for an end to the criminal excesses of the Israeli occupying forces. On the contrary, it defends Israel’s ‘right to protect its population’, while calling on it to ‘act proportionately’. In other words, it defends Israel’s crimes, and it is enough to be ‘proportionate’! We support the struggle of the Palestinian people against the Israeli occupation, for an independent, viable, sovereign Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital; the lifting of any exclusion of Palestinians on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; the immediate release of all Palestinian and other political prisoners in Israeli prisons; the withdrawal of the Israeli army from all the occupied territories of 1967.

Without these two conditions, I fear that everything will stay the same, that the divisions, tensions and desire for vengeance will further deepen and that violence will break out again in the future.

I welcome the ceasefire agreed after several failed attempts, and I hope that this will be sustainable and allow an understanding to be reached between the parties to the conflict. The imminent analysis, by the General Assembly of the United Nations, of Palestine’s request to be granted UN observer status may have been at the root of the conflict. However, nothing justifies this violation of human rights. Israel has a right to protect its people, but it also has an obligation to respect its neighbours. I support the Commission’s proposal that the EU should continue helping to find a solution, which will obviously entail the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state.

It also downplays the Israeli aggression and its causes, and condemns the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to resist. It casts a veil over Israel’s responsibility for the death of over 20 people, including civilians, children and political leaders who have been selectively assassinated, and also over the attacks by Israeli missiles against Syrian territory.

Worse, it considers that the Palestinians are responsible for the situation and contents itself with calling on Mr Netanyahu to act ‘proportionately’. As for the text’s support for the lifting of the blockade on Gaza, it is contingent upon ‘an effective control mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms into Gaza’, thus justifying the blockade in the name of Israel’s security.

Israel has disregarded all of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, is occupying territories that legitimately belong to the Palestinian State and continually violates the sovereignty and human rights of Palestinians. All of these infringements go unpunished, since no action will be taken in response to these war crimes against civilians.

Major civilian casualties have been avoided thanks to Israel’s strong military and technical capabilities. Egypt’s role in the area and its support in putting pressure on Palestinians to return to the roundtable for negotiations is very important. Continuation of the activities of Hamas is destructive also for the Palestinians living in the area. I supported the resolution but could not support paragraph 5.

According to international law, the Gaza Strip is part of a Palestinian State that does not yet exist. This non-status allows Israel, and Egypt, to do what they want with it. That is the first problem. Gaza’s other problem is a political one. Since the legislative elections of 2006, won by Hamas, who took power by force the following year to the detriment of Fatah, the Gaza Strip has been governed by the Islamist movement.

Particularly now when significant changes are taking place in the geostrategic context in which the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the CSDP operate, owing in particular to the upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa, the emergence on the international scene of new players with regional or even global ambitions and the reorientation of US defence policy priorities towards the Asia-Pacific area, it is important for the EU to assert its strategic autonomy through a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy. This strategic autonomy should be built by maintaining the link with NATO and other organisations and establishing a universal common EU position which would ensure consistency, act in a spirit of solidarity and make use of all the means and instruments available to secure peace and security for citizens.</p>

These are the first signs of Europe becoming a player in security and defence, a long-held ambition for those who believe that Europe, a first-rate economic power, cannot remain a ‘diplomatic dwarf’ for long. However, these initial signs do not yet herald any unequivocal advances, as Europe is, on the big global issues – and conflicts are among them – struggling to find its way and speak with one voice, despite the fact that everything – our economic weight, our democratic tradition, our diplomatic history, our role in promoting balance and dialogue – appears to favour greater EU involvement in these serious matters. It is because these matters are so serious that we have an obligation to press onwards and set ourselves clear defence priorities: the allocation of sufficient material and human resources to allow us to act more quickly and effectively; stronger coordination of Member States’ diplomatic and military resources; and consistency of analysis and action in our relations with international institutions such as NATO. To this end, the drafting of a white paper on the EU’s security and defence policy, which has been requested several times, is more necessary than ever.</p>

It is time for all European countries to show their willingness to endow the Union with real capabilities in line with the geopolitical challenges that we are facing.

Given the global threats and the strategic devaluation of the Atlantic space to the benefit of the Asia-Pacific region, it has become clear that we need to respond by improving capacity and coordination of resources and staff and by increasing the potential for force projection. Unfortunately there are sources of tension and instability near to the borders of the Union, which cannot fail to cause apprehension and encourage military vigilance and readiness. In this context, the Union’s efforts not only to equip itself with resources, but also to strengthen the alliance with the US and increasingly share the burden in the joint effort to protect democracy and human rights are particularly important. European society, which has thankfully been mostly free of armed conflicts for some considerable time, has become accustomed to minimising the importance of security and defence. Policy makers must try to reverse this trend and promote the need and respect for armed forces and the military condition.</p>

The fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics stripped military organisations such as NATO of their role. In reality, Europe has never been as prosperous, safe or free as it is now. This report, by Arnaud Danjean, on the implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), based on the Annual Report from the Council to the European Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, draws attention to the need to improve our action, bearing in mind the economic crisis facing the Member States and NATO’s attention being focused on another part of the globe (Africa and Asia) rather than Europe. I welcome the adoption of this report, for which I voted and which contains a very positive approach to the CSDP, particularly in times of budgetary austerity, as I agree that the EU cannot leave its defence solely to NATO. The EU must therefore increase cooperation between the Member States and create synergies between the CSDP and other policies.</p>

These developments are indissociable from the need to access and control the natural and energy resources on which the EU monopolies depend. The majority in Parliament have therefore clearly revealed their ambition: to bring about the destruction of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, through more aggression and belligerence in increasingly militarised international relations, through attacks on sovereignty, and through an evident crusade to occupy countries and regions that are geostrategically important. This policy fits, after all, with the EU’s role as the European pillar of NATO. This is only one position of the European Parliament, but it clearly shows the need for the re-establishment of democracy in the EU, through a process of demilitarisation and disarmament, the dissolution of NATO, and the creation of a system of collective security which respects and ensures the sovereignty of states and the free choice of the people.</p>

At the same time, threats and challenges to global security are growing because of uncertainties linked to the attitudes of states and non-state actors (such as terrorist organisations) engaged in programmes which dangerously encourage proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (including nuclear weapons), the escalation of local crises in the EU’s neighbourhood with major regional implications, such as the current Syrian conflict, the vagaries of the transition process in the Arab countries and its security dimension (for instance in Libya and the Sinai Peninsula), the evolution of the Afghan-Pakistan area in the light of the prospective withdrawal of NATO troops, and increased terrorist threats in Africa.

It is important not to allow Europe to enter a strategic decline. The European Union has the tools to pursue a truly ambitious policy in security and defence.

It is right that Europe should have an autonomous defence strategy and an effective security and defence policy that would enable it to act alone if necessary to resolve conflicts. For this to happen, however, we need proper civilian and military capabilities. While our alliance with NATO remains a priority and is inviolable, the EU must define its strategic interests in the light of changing threats and the Member States’ security capabilities. We need to carry out a review of the military strengths and weaknesses of the EU Member States. I would like to stress the importance of ensuring that permanent structured cooperation (PSC) does not become an elite club of the largest and strongest countries, relegating weaker countries to the sidelines and thereby distorting cooperation and creating an undesirable two-tier Europe. As I have advocated in previous discussions, one potential solution might be to ensure that countries which are weaker in terms of their military capability are given a remit and role that ties them into overall Common Security and Defence Policy based on their particular capabilities and characteristics. We agree with the rapporteur when he says that revitalisation of the CSDP in the key areas of institutions, operations and capabilities is a crucial task that the European Union needs to address.</p>

In recent times, certain events, especially the course of the Arab Spring, have led me to ask whether we should not become more deeply concerned with the relationship between the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy and NATO. I believe that the time has come for us to say what rules apply for Member States of the Union. Whether statesmen can, during the day, speak on behalf of the Union about peace, the observance of human rights and the binding nature of international law and, during the night, can the same statesmen decide on behalf of NATO to bomb a state, supply weapons to selected insurgents and break off hitherto unquestioned diplomatic relations. I am deeply convinced that we should start a debate on the boundary of Member States’ licence. Is it possible that some state has recognised Kosovo or an insurgent group in Syria without consulting the other states here and that the European Parliament has remained silent because it is also discussing the violation of human rights in Myanmar? For how long, for example, can Paris breach our agreements on a common policy in the Mediterranean and Africa without any consultation with their Union partners?</p>

The report also calls for the involvement of Parliament in the planned global approach to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and the drafting of a White Paper on the establishment of an appropriate strategic framework.</p>

The clauses promote military and civil interventions by the EU in Member States on the pretexts of ‘terrorism’, ‘natural or man-made disasters’, ‘cyber attacks’ and even ‘pandemics’ or ‘energy shortages’. The report describes the actions and mobilisations of the popular movement as ‘a threat to democratic institutions’. The report demands that Member States and the EU as a whole should be required to respond with ‘all the means’ in their power, in close collaboration with NATO, and calls upon the EU to adopt NATO’s new strategic approach, so that the EU and NATO can act together as global policeman and terroriser of the peoples. The report calls for a ‘permanent operational headquarters’ and a ‘permanent EU … crisis management … system’, training exercises for ‘crisis management’, and the development of ‘rapid response’ military capabilities and forces. The KKE votes against this reactionary and anti-popular report, and thus helps to strengthen the popular alliance and the anti-monopoly struggle of the working class and their allies for disengagement from the EU and for people’s power.</p>

As I have written, in order to be united in diversity, the Union must remain united in adversity. Clarifying the scope of these clauses and indicating the resources allowing them to be rapidly and flexibly implemented, where necessary, must be borne in mind by the main policy makers, who must encourage synergies, cooperation and information exchange.

Under the solidarity clause, military support is also demanded in case of terror attacks and natural or man-made disasters (the scope of this clause is not clearly defined: does it cover social unrest resulting from strikes or protests?), which implies military operations within the EU. Cyber attacks, pandemics and energy shortages can also lead to activation of the solidarity clause. This report is inseparable from the crisis in the EU, the pillage of countries such as Portugal, the exploitation of workers and the general public, the clawback of rights, loss of sovereignty, and backward steps in terms of political and democratic freedoms.

At first sight, these clauses appear attractive, but let us imagine a country where the situation has become catastrophic: the government would be forced by international organisations into policies that would lead the people into poverty. Exasperated by unemployment, wage decreases and a high tax burden, the citizens would hold an increasing number of protests and strikes. Some would be tempted by withdrawal from the Union, others by partition of their country. The government would not be able to maintain order due to lack of resources, having made swingeing cuts to its budget. In order to remain in power and be able to continue to pursue policy dictated elsewhere, it would make use of one of the clauses in the Treaty. European law enforcement forces would then be deployed, with the power to replace the local police forces entirely. Is this really so far-fetched? I believe that some countries in the Union are not far from this kind of situation. The nucleus of the European law enforcement force already exists: it is called Eurogendfor.

The rapporteur, supported by EPP and ALDE argued that CSDP can be one instrument for the implementing both clauses. and (2) More problematic is the link to NATO and the vagueness regarding European military capabilities. The report does not clarify how NATO Art. 5 and the Mutual Assistance/Defence clause should be linked or not linked politically and militarily. In our view we cannot (mis-)use the EU Assistance clause for (indirectly) integrating countries like Ireland, Austria, Sweden, etc. into NATO and its nuclear weapons arrangements.

      <p sl="fr">Under the cloak of so-called mutual defence and ‘solidarity’ clauses, the European Parliament is asking the EU to commit further to a European defence policy. The mutual defence clause (Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union) provides for an ‘obligation’ for Member States to react ‘by all the means in their power’ in the event of armed aggression against a fellow Member State, which goes further than NATO’s mutual assistance clause, given that unarmed attacks will also be concerned. The solidarity clause (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) paves the way for military interventions within the European Union, in particular in the event of a terrorist attack, or a natural or man-made disaster. Can social unrest and strikes be considered as ‘man-made disasters’? This report prefers military approaches to initiatives for peace and even to civil defence measures both inside and outside the Union. In particular, it presses for greater militarisation and armament of the EU. Such encouragement is ill-timed, to say the least, when we consider the warmongering tendencies of some Member States and when, in the height of irony, the EU has just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

Only in this way can we better tackle these challenges, which, in my opinion, require the Member States to develop their cyber security and defence plans in parallel with the European Union’s own comprehensive approach to this issue. I believe that the European Union should take action by starting to negotiate directly with the private sector on more rapid exchange of information, while always respecting the anonymity of partnerships in the private sector, and guaranteeing a balance between security measures and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. In particular, the European Union should invest in its transatlantic relations with the United States in order to strengthen cooperation in this area.</p>

Politically-motivated cyber attacks are targeting not only the information systems but also critical infrastructures of the Member States which are seeking to implement a crucial task in creating mutual trust between the state and private sector actors by developing frameworks for rapid information exchanges while guaranteeing anonymity of the private sector partners. One of ways to strengthen cyber security and defence is to enhance the role of the European Defence Agency and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) in assisting Member States, in helping to pool and share experience and in developing good practices.</p>

In today’s globalised world, cyber threats and attacks are growing and there is a threat to countries’ security and stability and it is therefore very important to develop a more stringent policy in the European Union for a high level of EU network and information security. A broad EU cyber security strategy needs to be developed, providing a definition of cyber security and defence and of a cyber attack. The development of a strategy should take into account good practices in those Member States which already have national cyber security strategies. I welcome the proposal to strengthen the efforts of the EU Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and national CERTs and to develop national contingency plans which could be used in the event of a cyber attack.

The report outlines and places in context all aspects of this problem, stating clearly the challenges facing the individual Member States and the EU, and pointing out that there are numerous obstacles of a political, legislative and organisational nature in the EU and its Member States to the development of a comprehensive and unified approach to cyber defence and cyber security. Sharing and coordination between Member States and the EU is still insufficient, while clear definitions of ‘cyber security’ and ‘cyber defence’ are lacking. A clear balance has to be established between security measures and citizens’ rights, such as the right to privacy, data protection and freedom of expression.

Nowadays, thanks to ‘information highways’, a huge amount of data is circulating, which, if properly used, can contribute enormously to improving our quality of life. However, when accessed by someone with malicious intent, it can have very harmful effects. The report by Tunne Kelam concerns the issue of cyber security and defence. This is an extremely important issue of which not all Member States are properly aware, as proven by the fact that only 10 Member States have adopted a prevention strategy for dealing with attackers causing significant damage. Piracy and cyber attacks on public authorities are commonplace and, as the social and economic crisis worsens, will certainly further increase. We must therefore protect our structures against this form of terrorism which does not use explosives.

It advocates establishing public-private partnerships in this field, with public resources therefore being transferred to the software and hardware monopolies through the European Defence Agency.

Cyberspace brings new challenges in an ever more interconnected and globalised world.

Too often in recent times, we in the European Parliament have had in our hands texts with an unpleasant tendency to try to erase a number of individual freedoms, under various pretexts.

This report is a missed opportunity to demand better protection of the digital sphere. The report favours an extremely repressive approach. Worse, on the grounds that cyber attacks have been conducted against military bodies, it even proposes military cooperation to fight cyber crime. It expressly indicates that: ‘building trust and confidence between the private sector and law enforcement authorities, defence and other competent institutions is of utmost importance in the fight against cybercrime’. It also proposes ‘public-private cooperation’ in which all participants are on an equal footing, which is not without problems for all of the sensitive areas related to the protection of personal data.

Ever-increasing extreme weather events in recent years represent an escalating cost to the global economy, not only for developing countries but for the world at large. The countries of Europe are no exception. Consequently, the EU should use all measures to reduce the risk of disasters and focus in particular on women and children who are the most vulnerable in crisis situations.

This report by Indrek Tarand concerns the role of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in case of climate-driven crises and natural disasters. We may be tempted to think that climate change does not affect us because we live far from the coast and rising sea levels will not reach us, or because we are not building along watercourses or on unstable soil, for example. This position is not only selfish, but also wrong. The consequences of climate change affect everyone, whether directly or indirectly. It is therefore essential to improve preventive action and climate security, particularly in the most vulnerable areas. We cannot forget that climate change has a direct impact on security and economy, as it can cause people to migrate to other parts of the globe.

In this way it seeks to justify the further militarisation of the EU, the development of military capabilities by the European Defence Agency, and enhanced coordination between NATO and the EU on ‘pooling and sharing’ and ‘smart defence’ projects, while respecting the ‘specific responsibilities’ of both organisations. These priorities confirm what we have been saying: that the process of militarising the EU is making the EU into the European pillar of NATO. The real objective is to respond to the intensifying global fight for access to and control over regions which are the source of the vital energy resources and raw materials on which the EU monopolies depend. The rise in, or the threat of, conflicts in third countries due to climate phenomena can only be effectively tackled if their causes are duly identified and resolved. Such a solution can only be found if we put a stop to this neo-colonialism, to the destruction of national sovereignty, and to economic control by capitalist monopolies, or, in other words, if we break with a dominant productive system based on the plundering of nature and the exploitation of people.</p>

These events also represent an aggravation of threats to international peace and human security. Natural disasters, exacerbated by climate change, are highly destabilising, particularly for vulnerable states. Populations with deteriorating access to freshwater and foodstuffs caused by natural catastrophes exacerbated by climate change are forced to migrate, thus overstretching the economic, social and administrative capabilities of already fragile regions or failing states. This creates conflict and has a negative impact on overall security. This situation often results in competition between communities and countries for scarce natural resources.

      <p sl="it">In recent times, public debate has concentrated on a number of issues that have overshadowed the question of climate change, which should not be underestimated as a global threat. Natural catastrophes in recent years have had very serious impact both as a direct cost in terms of rebuilding and aid and as an indirect cost in terms of increases in insurance premiums. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to events of this type and deteriorating access to freshwater and foodstuffs caused by natural disasters lead to permanent economic and social damage. I believe that security should be the key issue in relaunching the debate on climate change and natural disasters. Specific tools should be made available for managing the impact of such events, especially on vulnerable populations. I also believe that the EU has the capacity to improve its management of risks of conflict and instability due to climate change and natural disasters. I therefore voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Climate change and its socioeconomic consequences pose challenges to the Common Security and Defence Policy. The conflicts emerging in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel have been triggered by the climate change experienced in these regions. As a result, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy should take account of climate change by placing it at the heart of risk assessments for civilian and military missions. It is therefore essential that climate change is mainstreamed throughout the European External Action Service. An integrated approach must be developed by creating a system for coordinating means of response to the widest possible range of crises, with this system necessarily being in permanent contact with the United Nations, NATO and non-governmental organisations. For those reasons, I voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the role of the Common Security and Defence Policy in case of climate-driven crises and natural disasters. Energy security is closely related to climate change and must be improved by reducing the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels such as those imported from Russia via pipelines, which will become vulnerable to disruption by the melting of the permafrost. I support the reduction of this risk multiplier through a reinforced EU strategy for the Arctic, and through an enhanced policy of EU-generated renewable energies and energy efficiency that significantly reduces the Union’s reliance on external sources and thereby improves its security position. I believe that we need to bring the broader developments in the field of the European defence industrial base into line with the specific requirements of climate-driven crises and natural disasters. We must also make sure that procurement programmes and capability development programmes devote adequate financial means and other resources to the specific needs of responding to climate change and natural disasters.</p>

It should be noted that Kazakhstan is one of the main countries that has played a positive role in Central Asia, making efforts to develop good neighbourly relations, resume regional cooperation and resolve all bilateral issues by peaceful means. By thus pursuing the principles of better democratic rights and equality, Kazakhstan has been admitted to the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe. The Kazakh authorities have also taken important steps in terms of cooperation with NGOs in West Kazakhstan, in order to improve the situation for the inhabitants of the region, and in particular for workers on strike. This initiative by Kazakhstan in the Central Asian region is not just commendable but merits further close cooperation and support from the EU. It is also important to note that the EU is a key trading partner for Kazakhstan and the biggest investor in the country. As Kazakhstan has clearly expressed its wish to approximate to the EU’s standards and its social and economic models, which will entail a thorough reform of the Kazakh state and public administration, the country has shown that it has already been able to achieve significant results in the areas of poverty reduction, public health and education.

However, the tragic events of December 2011 (repression and detention of members of the opposition) and clear voting irregularities in the elections on 15 January 2012 suggest that Kazakhstan still has a long way to go. In the negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, there is an ongoing constructive dialogue between the EU, representatives of Kazakhstan and representatives of civil society on issues of mutual interest. The EU is the biggest investor in Kazakhstan and is heavily dependent on imports of mined phosphate rock for its agricultural production, which makes it even more important to maintain good trade relations.

Ms Jaakonsaari’s report on a new enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan points to the latter’s serious shortcomings with regard to democracy and human rights, in particular workers’ rights. It states that, in order to tackle these practices, which are incompatible with the objectives of the European Union, the trade component of the agreement must include a binding chapter on compliance with social, democratic and environmental standards. I call on the Commission to apply the recommendations set out in this report in the ongoing negotiations. In the event of serious breaches of human rights, the European Union should not be afraid to invoke all conditionality clauses included in the agreement and, if need be, to suspend it temporarily. This conditionality is a prerequisite for maintaining a fair external policy and even-handed trade policy.</p>

Although Kazakhstan is the Central Asian country with the most open economy and the most extensive partnership with the European Union in that region, we cannot ignore, in our partnership agreements, scrupulous respect for human rights. If Kazakhstan wants to remain as one of the EU’s trading partners, it must make progress with the current internal reforms, with absolute respect for the freedom of association, assembly, expression and religion. I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution as I consider that the EU-Kazakhstan negotiations for a new partnership agreement must, without question, include respect for the EU’s values and a series of reforms to establish a democratic regime. Any violations of human rights must lead to the agreement being suspended.

A worrying situation with regard to workers’ rights and democratic rights is being utilised to justify EU pressure on, and interference in, the internal affairs of this country. However, no matter how worrying this situation, the people of Kazakhstan should be left to change it. The objective is not to help improve the working and living conditions of this people.

The EU agreed to the Kazakh request, but on a less ambitious level (No free trade agreement until Kazakhstan is a member of the World Trade Organisation and no visa facilitation agreement).

It is therefore important to ensure the economic and social stability of these communities. This can primarily be achieved by promoting fisheries management by marine biogeographic region, with fair and informed local management of artisanal fishing, which has little autonomy or onboard freezing capability, and which does not operate outside its exclusive economic zone.

What is at stake here is nothing less than the survival of European small-scale fishing: by modernising ageing vessels and promoting youth employment in the sector, but also by making use of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund to make vessels more economically and environmentally sustainable and to support the sector in emergencies.

I agree that small-scale fishing – comprising artisanal fishing and some types of coastal/inshore fishing, shellfishing and other traditional extensive aquaculture activities such as the natural breeding of molluscs in inshore waters – are not adequately represented in the European Commission’s proposals for reforming the CFP. Our duty is to safeguard the role played by such activities in our states, which have economic importance but are also linked to often unique local traditions. The over-centralised model of fisheries management favoured by the Commission has been a failure, and I believe that the CFP reform should also encourage and support the development of operators that use fishing techniques with less impact on resources and that are of greater benefit to the communities of which they are part in terms of generating jobs and of the quality of those jobs.</p>

We need to take into account its problems but also its potential and make a series of changes to the three pillars of the reform: the Basic Regulation, the COM Regulation and the financial instrument for implementing the CFP, now known as the EMFF. The following, inter alia , are characteristics usually associated with small-scale fishing: strong ties to the economy, social structure, culture and traditions of coastal towns and communities, fishing activity undertaken relatively close to the coast and involving shorter periods at sea, greater direct incorporation of human labour, and so on. At the moment the belief is that the European Commission is proposing to continue the current centralised management of the CFP which frequently provides guidelines that are divorced from reality, poorly understood by the sector (which is not involved in discussing or developing them), and difficult to implement, producing results that are often the opposite of those intended. Furthermore, the great diversity that characterises the reality of fisheries in the EU is not being taken into account with the proposal of a single, mandatory system for accessing resources. Implementing this system along the lines suggested could have profoundly negative consequences for small-scale fishing sectors, since the adopted definition of ‘small-scale fishing’ is reductionist and does not reflect the true situation. We therefore need to ensure that we have a programme which promotes the participation of young fishermen and women in the activities of this sector and creates mechanisms which are beneficial to all coastal communities.</p>

It is therefore vital that the new CFP takes advantage of the potential offered by small fishing communities, not only to combat the social and financial crisis, which has caused struggling families to abandon their towns and villages, but also to ensure the sustainable conservation of resources and the marine ecosystem. They must, therefore, be protected from large-scale fishing. I voted in favour of this report because I advocate a significant increase in the support for small-scale fishing, particularly in the outermost regions, decentralised management of this sector, and the use of more selective fishing gear.

Despite these differences, they share a range of characteristics, which make them similar to each other and set them apart from large-scale fishing, which includes industrial fishing. As has been mentioned in various European Parliament resolutions, small-scale fishing should be the subject of differentiated treatment, with management systems and models adapted to its specific characteristics and problems. The European Commission’s proposals for reforming the common fisheries policy (CFP) are not considered to take duly into account the specific characteristics of small-scale fishing. These proposals do not offer an adequate response to the problems currently faced by small-scale fishing. The objectives set out for conserving resources – the need for which is not denied, in general terms, quite the contrary – are not accompanied by the definition of economic and social objectives. The socioeconomic dimension of fisheries policy is thus being neglected. This issue is particularly pertinent for small-scale fishing, given the difficult socioeconomic situation this sector faces.

Still, the principle problem with the report is the list of actions that should be subsidized, including start-up packages for fishermen (in an over-capitalized industry!), construction of new fishing ports; storage for fish that cannot be profitable sold; paying fishermen to not fish during closed fishing seasons (as distinct from periods following natural or man-made disasters such as the Prestige). The report is also ambiguous about the need for the public purse to modernise and renew the fleets. In 2 RCVs (para 38, 40) we demonstrated our opposition to subsidies for temporary cessation of fishing and sudden increases in fuel subsidies. These paragraphs were not defeated so remain in the final resolution.</p>

This segment of the fishing sector has shown itself to be remarkably resilient in the face of the challenges of the current global economic crisis. It is also economically sustainable given the number of jobs it generates. New and more coherent objectives must be defined that respond to the needs and the characteristics of small-scale fishing. We must stop undervaluing this sector and provide better management with concrete proposals for support. The potential for development of the sector also depends on strengthening promotion of young people’s involvement.

Accordingly, the rapporteur considers that changes are needed in relation to small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing in the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). The definition of ‘small-scale fishing’ should take account of a range of criteria, in addition to the strict criterion of size. Furthermore, the CFP reform should ensure the conditions for effective local management, as this is the best way to meet the needs of small-scale fishing.

      <p sl="en">As shadow rapporteur for this report, I was involved in defining artisanal fishing. This term features repeatedly in texts on the common fisheries policy reform, without appearing to fit the definition established by the Commission. Indeed, the latter admits to having opted for a simplistic definition – currently, all vessels measuring 12 metres or less. However, this fails completely to take account of the diverse nature of European fishing. Given that small operators have more difficulty in gaining access to European funding, a new definition may be required to ensure fairer distribution of this funding. To that end, classification as a micro-, small or medium-sized enterprise and the skipper-on-board requirement appear to be more appropriate criteria. Even if Parliament has not come up with a final definition of artisanal fishing, this report should be welcomed for anticipating the discussions on the financing of fisheries and for wisely acknowledging that there is not one single criterion but a whole range of criteria for defining artisanal fishing.</p>

In particular, for the purposes of the new Fisheries Policy Regulation, it is necessary to define what should be understood as artisanal fishing, and to take account of the repercussions that this type of fishing will have for funding under the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.

The proposal is aimed at encouraging the sustainability of the EU’s fishing outside EU waters, including the outermost regions. I agree that in order to ensure sustainable fishing, there is a need to improve the acquisition of data on fish stocks that the EU is fishing, or which are destined for the EU market and ensure that information on total removals by local fleets and other third country fleets is available. I welcome the proposal to ensure that shipowners make a greater contribution when paying for the right to fish.

The EU is still currently the world’s largest market, has one of the largest fleets flying its flags and usually ranks among the top three catching powers. However, new markets in emerging economies are developing fast, especially in Asia. Many appear not to fulfil their responsibilities as flag, port and market states, or even to respect basic human rights, thereby creating harsh, even untenable competition. It should be noted that the basic principle is that activities outside the EU should be conducted according to the same standards as those applied to operators in the European Union. Similarly, if a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) applies a higher standard than the common fisheries policy (CFP) to EU vessels operating on its territory, then those higher standards should generally be included in the CFP. There is an urgent need to adopt new, fair and equitable resource allocation systems among RFMO members based on transparent environmental and social allocation criteria while ensuring that management and conservation measures are effectively implemented and enforced by all market participants.</p>

The EU must be concerned, not only about its own marine resources, but also on a global scale. In order to improve the global fishing situation, the EU must take the lead in environmental and management terms through a consensual plan on long-distance fishing, which must be agreed to by third countries.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this proposal on increasing the participation of EU citizens in the European Parliament elections to be held in 2014. The resolution is aimed at urging the European political parties to propose candidates for the Presidency of the Commission before the EP elections. The aim is for discussions on these candidates to be made the main emphasis of the 2014 EP election campaign, thus encouraging citizens to become more actively involved in the elections and to vote in them. The aim is also for a certain number of future European Commission members to be chosen among newly-elected MEPs, thus representing EU citizens more effectively. The resolution also calls for greater gender balance to be ensured in the Commission. I welcome the proposals set out here and the proposal to hold the 2014 elections at the end of May instead of June, in order to give the European Parliament more time to prepare for the election of the future Commission President.</p>

      <p sl="en">All opinion polls repeatedly reveal a sense of mistrust towards the European Union. One of the main reasons for this is the distance between European Union decision-makers and the people of Europe. People do not know who does what or who makes decisions and on whose behalf. It is the civic and democratic relationship that we must do everything to repair. The European elections in 2014, a key opportunity for the people of the European Union to exercise their right of democratic expression, will be decisive from this point of view. For as crucial as European Union integration is, it is unthinkable without a real and powerful democratic counterweight. European democracy is, first and foremost, the fairest representation of opinions by means of proportional voting. Next it is gender parity as an overriding principle. It is also decisive innovation: the recommendation, adopted by Parliament, that European political parties should nominate a candidate to stand for Commission President. These candidates would campaign on the basis of specific proposals and therefore lend a face to European politics. In representative democracy, it is citizens who take decisions through their representatives. Involving them in the choice of Commissioners will satisfy fully this founding principle.</p>

This approach also involves unacceptable interference in national electoral systems, by proposing ‘minimum thresholds’ for the election of Members of the European Parliament, in the name of alleged ‘stability of the Union’s legislative procedures’, ‘reliable majorities’ and ‘safeguarding the functionality of Parliament’. If adopted, this change will mean, for countries like Portugal, the end of the current genuinely proportional system, with possible anti-democratic consequences in the distribution of mandates. The enhanced ‘legitimacy’ of the European Parliament’s role defended by this resolution is indissociable from the ongoing attacks in the EU on national sovereignty and on the most basic rights and political and democratic freedoms of the workers and people.

Most striking is that as many members of the Commission as possible be drawn from elected members of the European Parliament. These changes will basically serve as an answer to the accusation that the Commission is made up of unelected bureaucrats, who – on this argument – should not be exercising as much power as they do. In sum, what the changes should effect is to invest those commissioners who are elected as MEPs with a degree of accountability towards the voters.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the human rights situation in Iran is constantly deteriorating. Numerous cases of ill-treatment, torture, medical neglect and death in Iranian prisons have been documented. Sattar Beheshti, a 35-year-old blogger, was arrested on 30 October by Iran’s cyber police in a raid on his mother’s home in Robat Karim. They also confiscated a number of his personal belongings, including his computers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Beheshti’s family tried to get information from security and judicial officials about his whereabouts and the reason for his arrest. No answer was given until 6 November, when police officials told the family that the blogger had died in custody. The authorities did not provide any explanation for his death. This is why in this resolution we strongly want to demand an immediate investigation into the circumstances of Sattar Beheshti’s death in custody and call for the prosecution of the officials responsible. We also have to recognise the right of the family to clarify all the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to remember the execution, on 22 October, of ten Iranians accused of drug-related offences. We are concerned that they did not receive a fair trial and they were subjected to torture during their detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Probably, in many cases, none of this is new. The problem is that we are being forced once again to ask the Iranian authorities to ensure that prisoners are not subjected to any torture or other ill-treatment and that they are allowed to have regular access to lawyers of their choice and medical treatment when needed.

Even though the Iranian parliament has undertaken to investigate the death of Sattar Beheshti in a prison cell, we cannot overlook the fact that many more defenders of human rights are in Iranian prison cells in fear for their lives. We must therefore use all possible means such as sanctions, international diplomacy or targeted restrictive measures to stop this brutal repression of the Iranian people by the state authorities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think that we can understand many things about Iran and we can accept that it is a country with which we must negotiate. We can also understand the desire for the denuclearisation of the Middle East. We can understand many things, but I cannot understand the cruelty of this regime when it comes to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must say that it goes beyond the political; there has been a significant rise in the number of death sentences imposed, a blogger has died in suspicious circumstances and our repeated requests to meet the two winners of the Sakharov Prize have met with no response.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore appealing to the Iranian authorities right now – in the very spirit of reaching out to them – to consider their approach to human rights. I doubt we can ever understand each other if this chapter remains closed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like, in December, to be able to celebrate the award of the Sakharov Prize with its two winners, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who is currently on hunger strike, and Jafar Panahi, who is appealing a sentence against him and who risks going to prison. These two laureates were chosen not in defiance of Iran, but because, for us, they represent freedom and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the fascist Iranian regime has used the smokescreen of Gaza to accelerate the number of executions and amputations that have been taking place in that country. More than 80 people have been executed in the past ten days, but that simply adds to the 120 000 people executed over the past 30 years – many of them supporters of the opposition PMOI. I have here a volume that contains the first volume of 20 000 names of executed PMOI supporters in the fascist-run regime of Iran, which is an absolute outrage.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also an outrage that this Parliament tried to send a friendship delegation last month to visit these murderers. The only reason they were stopped was because we awarded the Sakharov Prize to the Iranian dissident, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who is now on her sixth day of hunger strike and is critically ill. We must never send a friendship delegation to that fascist regime again.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, the current Iranian Government flagrantly violates human rights and tramples on the basic freedoms of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This time, we are also paying particular attention to executions, and especially to 35-year-old blogger Sattar Beheshti, who died of torture at Evin prison last week. The reason for his detention was merely his political opinion and criticism of the Iranian Government on Facebook. The international community and human-rights organisations have taken notice of this manslaughter by the Iranian Government, and have also expressed concern for the safety of Mr Beheshti’s family.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr Beheshti’s death has drawn attention to the miserable human-rights situation in the country, but not everyone can see the bigger picture or how the Iranian Government is working behind the scenes to influence a weakening of the security situation in the entire Middle East. The current Iranian Government is the greatest threat to world peace. It is quite incomprehensible that the international community mainly sees from the sidelines how the Iranian Government has quietly been able to develop its military nuclear weapons programme and remain indifferent to the opinions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, among others. The current leadership of the country can make public threats to destroy Israel, another member of the UN, and supports the Hezbollah terrorist group, which operates in Lebanon and Syria, and during the most recent crisis in the Middle East it sent weapons to Hamas, among other things. At the same time, the current Iranian Government has put pressure on Iraq concerning their treatment of the Iranian opposition, who are currently in Camp Ashraf and Camp Liberty.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I do hope that both this EP resolution and particularly also the output from the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, will have even sharper wording, and that we can continue to make real progress in these tough economic times, so that Iran and its current government starts to take responsibility for the poor treatment of its own citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the tragic death of Sattar Beheshti as a result of brutal torture in the infamous Evin prison following his arrest for so-called ‘actions against national security’ on social networks and Facebook is, unfortunately, not an isolated case at all. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 15 people detained for exercising their basic rights have died in custody or as a result of injuries from alleged mistreatment or neglect since 2009. Added to that is the massive number of activists who have been executed on trumped-up charges. Some estimates put that number at 660 people in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">This repression and brutality needs to end now. Of course, this repression and brutality also should not be used as a pretext for military action against Iran. The international working class and anti-war movement must stand against any military action or sanctions against the Iranian people, while at the same time supporting their struggle to release all political prisoners, end state torture, end the death penalty and overthrow this regime.</p>

Although the exact circumstances surrounding his death have not yet been established, several reports indicate that he died as a direct result of torture.

It is true that the human rights situation in Iran is troubling and that this country has the dubious honour of topping the list of the most executions per capita: there have been 383 individual public executions since the beginning of the year, six group executions since 27 October 2012 and 20 public hangings on 7 and 8 November 2012 alone. The regime is attempting to speed up the execution of almost a thousand prisoners through the creation of a ‘death committee’.

      <p sl="en">The death in custody now of Sattar Beheshti, a blogger, is a grave crime which must not go unpunished.

If you do not shut your big mouth we do whatever we want. You must shut up and should not inform, otherwise you will be strangled anonymously. Day and night threatening phone calls do not stop.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Members for their very pertinent views and for the serious debate today. The European Union is seriously concerned about the deteriorating human rights record in Iran. The continuous repression of political opponents, human rights defenders, journalists, artists, bloggers, lawyers, women and minority groups is a real problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament is playing an important role in denouncing this situation. The award of this year’s Sakharov Prize to two leading Iranians defending freedom of thought – the lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, and the film director Jafar Penahi – is a very significant example of Parliament’s commitment to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The tragic death of blogger Sattar Beheshti in custody is a poignant example of the precarious situation of human rights activists in Iran. The European Union responded swiftly by urging the Iranian authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances of his death. Afterwards the Iranian judiciary announced that an inquiry had been launched and that the persons responsible would be prosecuted. We shall of course closely follow developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Early October saw a spate of arrests of prominent human rights lawyers. The EU reacted to this on several fronts by summoning the Iranian Ambassador to the EU in Brussels, issuing a statement and carrying out a démarche in Tehran.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iran’s extensive use of the death penalty is particularly worrisome. So far we have confirmation of 338 executions this year. This reconfirms that Iran is one of the world’s most frequent users of capital punishment. In addition, collective and public executions are common in Iran. The EU has a strong stance against the death penalty and we have repeatedly condemned executions in Iran. The High Representative and Vice-President, Catherine Ashton, issued her latest statement on 23 October condemning the collective executions of 10 Iranians charged with drug smuggling.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU also remains deeply concerned about the position of ethnic and religious minorities in Iran. Despite constitutional guarantees of equality, they are subject to an array of discriminatory laws and practices. We are using all tools available to raise awareness and call on Iran to respect the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination. We recall that 78 individuals are now on the EU human rights sanctions list for human rights violations in Iran.

      <p sl="pl">Cases of human rights violations are commonplace in Iran. The international media and NGOs are constantly informing the world of further mass executions. Iran is starting to specialise in these, and is now second on the global list of countries implementing the death penalty. We are well aware that under the Sharia law currently in force, the death penalty can be imposed for murder, adultery, rape, armed attack, drug trafficking and apostasy. The death penalty is implemented in public, even in the case of minors, and court proceedings often fail to comply with any of the criteria for a fair trial. A recent much-publicised case involved the hanging of 22 people for drug trafficking. Political assassinations are often carried out behind prison walls. This is what happened for example to Sattar Beheshti. He was arrested for allegedly committing a cybercrime, which proved to be posting comments on the social and political situation in Iran on a blog. Mr Beheshti died after spending a few days in detention. The circumstances surrounding the death of this 35-year-old blogger are shrouded in secrecy. We must therefore add our voice to those calling on the Iranian authorities to provide a detailed explanation of these events. Freedom of speech is being stifled in Iran on a daily basis. Many opposition activists and journalists have been imprisoned, including foreign ones. Having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the European Union now has a particular responsibility to speak out against violations of human rights.</p>

Declaring a state of emergency is an important step, but the government needs to stop the attacks on the Rohingya community. That would require a change in the 1982 Law on Citizenship and an analysis of the causes that led to this violence. Appropriate measures, such as access to education, work permits and freedom of movement, are also required.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union must help to stabilise the situation by providing aid and helping Burma, now considered a former dictatorship, to move towards democracy, which is being threatened by the Rakhine situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We hope that the Burmese authorities will accept these recommendations as a way to support the country’s transition towards democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is the third motion for a resolution on Burma since the beginning of the year. The previous resolution was adopted in September and also concerned the violence in Rakhine State and the plight of the Rohingya, who are persecuted by all Burma’s political forces, including the friends of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the situation of the Rohingya community has not improved; in fact, it has deteriorated further. Our motion for a resolution takes an even firmer stance with regard to the Burmese authorities than that adopted in September, and I welcome that. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left has therefore been involved in drafting this motion for a resolution and will support it, but I cannot help wondering about the relevance of the subjects of our urgent motions for a resolution and, above all, about their usefulness. It is our duty and responsibility to be more balanced in our choice of urgent subjects of debate and not to worry about whether it will annoy this or that state. Our resolutions must condemn human rights violations, irrespective of the strategic, political and economic interests of the European Union and its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It would have been more relevant, in my opinion, to talk about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Kivu provinces or the rule of law in Turkey as regards the Kurdish question, at a time when hundreds of Kurds are on a hunger strike that almost cost several lives and when Mr Erdogan is calling for the reintroduction of the death penalty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As we debate the situation in Burma, we must not overlook the problems of the Chin minority. It is estimated that this group consists of 1.5 million people who live along the border with India, and are almost all of them are Christian. For decades now, the Chin people have been the victims of systematic persecution on the grounds of religion. These citizens are being arrested, and sentenced to death without any charges having been brought against them. Women are being raped by soldiers, places of worship are being damaged, and the clergy harassed. These criminal acts merit condemnation. They are fuelled by a desire to force the population to renounce Christianity in favour of Buddhism. What is most dramatic about the situation is that this population group is suffering ongoing famine, which is the main result of the Burmese authorities’ treatment of this minority. Seventy per cent of the Chin population is living beneath the poverty threshold, with no chance of receiving any aid. That is why I wish to appeal from this Chamber to the Burmese authorities, calling on them to cease their persecution of this group and implement a humanitarian policy. First and foremost, aid organisations must be granted freedom to act. In addition, no limitations should be placed on the activities of UN agencies or on free access to information.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of course this all applies equally to the Rohingya, who live in the neighbouring state of Arakan, and to other persecuted minorities. Our financial support must take account of the fact that a more lenient policy towards minorities is called for. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, there has definitely been a certain amount of positive development in Burma, but it has been overshadowed by the fact that, since June, more than 100 000 refugees have been forced to flee owing to what should be called a policy of ethnic cleansing, since these refugees really live in terrible conditions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Those of you who are sitting in the visitors’ gallery now, imagine if all of your children were undernourished. Imagine if this entire Chamber and all of Strasbourg were filled with undernourished people who were fleeing. It is a completely preposterous development that is taking place in Burma right now.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The fact that governments such as the Swedish Government are going to Burma under these conditions in order to discuss arms deals and other trade links does not tally with our view on human rights and weapons exports.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I want the EU to take overall responsibility, ensure that the existing embargo is maintained, and impose requirements on having access to these regions so that we can offer assistance.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If the Burmese Government itself will not, cannot or instead absolutely refuses to help these people, it is our duty to ensure that we help them. If so, we must also, with the help of the trade agreements and other agreements that we have with Burma, provide the conditions required for people on the ground to be able to obtain help.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This development is catastrophic, and I am rather astonished that these very people call themselves Buddhists. Their religion speaks of non-violence at the same time as they spread violence at home.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is an absurdity. They should look in the mirror, read their religious texts once more and realise that this is a total crime against their own values, not only European values.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have the warmest sentiments towards the Buddhist philosophy and that is precisely why I find it difficult to understand how people who believe in compassion, peace and harmony continue persecuting the Rohingya Muslim community in Rakhine State in Burma.</p>
      <p sl="en">Referring to the debate and resolution of 13 September 2012, I would like to reiterate and insist that the Burmese authorities secure stability in the region, end unequal treatment of the Rohingyas and make efforts for reconciliation. Of course it is not only up to the government, but first and foremost up to the Buddhist community in Rakhine State. I would like to reiterate the words of a great Hindu statesman Mahatma Gandhi, who said: ‘An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind’. I call on the Burmese authorities to end discriminatory practices against Rohingya and to carry out a full and independent investigation into the distressing events that have taken place in Rakhine State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome the offer of EUR 78 million by President Barroso of the European Commission during his visit to the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw. The amount is foreseen for development aid, which cannot be unconditional. Straightforward reforms must be carried out and visible progress must be made in Burma.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am pleased that we are discussing Burma today, because on the one hand it gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the progress which as been made there in going from basically a military, authoritarian state towards democracy. While everything is not perfect, I think the visit there by President Obama was in itself an indication that in the broader sense Burma’s progress has been recognised worldwide. That is important.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, there are difficulties, of course, particularly in Rakhine State. The Rohingyas need to be given citizenship, because you cannot have a stateless group within a state. You will never get solutions if that situation continues. They also need outside help. I come from Ireland, where we had a similar situation in Northern Ireland: it was seen as Catholic versus Protestant. The role played by the European Union and the United States was vital. We can play the same role in Burma.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, this is the second time in two months that we have discussed the situation of Muslims in the Burmese region of Rohingya. Burma’s democratic efforts and economic and geostrategic potential have been confirmed by the recent visit of President Obama.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, the continuing inter-religious atrocities in Rakhine State force us once again to call on the Burmese authorities to seek a peaceful solution to the ongoing problems in the region, which is beset by bloody violence generated by poverty and intolerance. Since June, over 100 000 people have been forced to leave their homes and the situation in the refugee camps is getting worse. There is an increasing number of deaths and disappearances in the Bay of Bengal because refugees trying to reach Malaysia in unsuitable boats have been refused entry to Bangladesh.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Burmese authorities must act urgently to stop the humanitarian crisis resulting in confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists, and help to start a reconciliation process based on mutual tolerance.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Burmese regime is certainly a very brutal one and those who referred to the situation of Christians in Burma are right in what they said about the Buddhists’ actions. Nonetheless, I feel that what the Burmese authorities are doing is applying the principle of ‘divide and rule’. This is typical of certain regimes and autocracies. Religious differences are exploited largely for political gain. Mr Kelly drew a comparison with Northern Ireland, and I think that he would agree that religious circumstances are very often exploited for political ends. This means that we should not focus on the ideological differences between Buddhism and Christianity because the two faiths actually have much in common. Instead, we should try to understand the nature of that regime, which involves fostering divisions, and setting groups against each other on the pretext of religious differences. The European Union has a positive role to play in that respect.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Rohingyas have become victims of ethnic unrest, being expelled from the country for establishing local government bodies. It is therefore essential rapidly to communicate with the government of Burma, telling it to take effective steps to prevent a humanitarian crisis in this region. First of all, it is necessary to provide immediate humanitarian aid to the refugee camps, in order to alleviate the suffering of the refugees. At the same time, we must strongly request the Burmese government to recognise the Rohingya population as full citizens of their country with all rights of citizenship, freedom of movement and the right to education and work. In return for the financial and material assistance provided by the European Union to Burma, we must demand that the Burmese executive take rapid and effective steps for an immediate improvement in the living conditions and situation of the Rohingya community.</p>

The conflict between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims is inflicting a lot of pain on innocent people. Even worse is the escalation of the conflict that took place in October.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recent violent attacks have left 89 Burmese dead and 35 000 displaced, and destroyed over 5 000 houses and other buildings. The conflict has so far left 110 000 Burmese without a home. They need food and shelter. I call on the Commission to help these people, to deliver the EUR 8 billion of financial assistance and to help Rakhine State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the Burmese Government’s decision to launch an investigation into the source of this violence, but the result is what matters.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on 21 October a further wave of violence swept through the Burmese state of Arakan and quickly spread to other parts of the country. Almost 90 victims were recorded in less than a week. The precise causes of the current conflict are unknown, but it is known, however, that the disturbances have resulted in 28 000 persons being displaced, bringing the total number of persons displaced as a result of this conflict and the one in June to over 100 000. It should be added that these people are living in refugee camps in dreadful conditions. The humanitarian aid currently available is insufficient, and food, water and medical care are in short supply.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The scale of violence reflects the tensions present over a number of years between the Buddhist community to which the majority of the country’s population belong, and the minority Muslim population. In the light of the current conflict and the earlier bloody one in June of this year, the Burmese authorities must immediately halt the spread of violence across the country. In addition, the Burmese Government should implement a more effective policy of integration of all minorities at grass-roots level, leading to the cessation of conflicts of an ethnic and religious nature. Enabling members of the Muslim minority to gain Burmese citizenship could be a first important step in that direction.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is right for the European External Action Service to pay attention to the violence between Burma’s ethnic groups, even though the roots of the conflict are hundreds of years old.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, in September we expressed our deep concern about the situation of Rohingya Muslims, which has become more and more difficult in Myanmar. According to the harsher assessments, it may soon be classed as genocide. In the background, of course, is the problem that although the Rohingyas have lived in Myanmar for centuries, the military junta stripped them of their nationality in 1982 and they do not even belong to the approximately 135 ethnic minorities in the country that are recognised by law.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Even though we have recently had encouraging and even good news about Myanmar, it is quite clear that the international community must not be blinded. The situation in Rakhine is a great cause for concern in terms of this entire process of reform, and the country might even end up being subjugated by an authoritarian government again. We must remember that these processes of change are, above all, slow and still at a very early stage. The international community must therefore continue to pay attention to this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to update you on the security situation in Myanmar’s Rakhine State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since violence first erupted in May this year, the government has drastically increased the presence of the security forces. The army’s presence has calmed the situation, preventing further killings and arson attacks. In contrast, local police and border guards are widely regarded as biased. Overall the government’s handling of the situation has been, by and large, adequate. The official death toll amounts to 89 people. Several thousand homes have been torched and 110 000 people have been displaced, the vast majority of them being Muslims. Most internally displaced population camps are crowded, ill-equipped and lacking shelter and basic sanitation. To alleviate the suffering of the displaced communities, our Humanitarian Office, ECHO, allocated an additional EUR 1 million this week to provide food, in addition to the EUR 4 million of humanitarian aid announced by President Barroso during his visit to the country on 3 November 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation remains highly volatile. The latest reports we have indicate that the government is making serious efforts to provide security and to identify and prosecute the instigators. Arrests in recent days signal a more assertive stance by the government towards parts of the Rakhine population who orchestrated the violent outbreaks. This needs to be acknowledged, in particular as it runs against the majority populist Buddhist mainstream.</p>
      <p sl="en">In high-level contacts – including President Barroso – the EU has continuously reminded the government of its responsibility to provide humanitarian access and to ensure the safety of all residents. Furthermore, we have dispatched expert missions to the affected areas in order to assess the situation at first hand and to look for opportunities for the EU to help develop both short- and long-term interventions. These are designed to stabilise the situation and pave the way for a peaceful co-existence of the two communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government-appointed Rakhine Investigation Commission will submit an interim report with 40 recommendations to the President this week. The Commission was formed in August with a broad mandate. It will cover the causes of the violence, frame a response strategy, and suggest ways to promote the reconciliation of both communities. The Commission was put together with a view to representing the ethnic diversity of the country. We regret that so far no Rohingya representatives have been included, although the country’s Muslim Community is represented. Nevertheless, we note that the Commission has consulted a wide range of stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The long-term solution to the situation of the Rohingya, including the question of citizenship, lies within Myanmar.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the issue of the situation of migrants in Libya is certainly not a new one. I remember how, not that long ago, when Colonel Gaddafi was still in power, the European Union was attempting to negotiate an absolutely shameful agreement with Gaddafi so that he would keep the migrants in his country, even though we were aware of the awful conditions to which they were subjected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fault certainly does not lie with the new Libyan Government, which has just been elected, but rather with the absence of any legislation, structure, culture or institutions supporting the protection of migrants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, their situation is worse than ever: they are persecuted by ex-rebel groups, Katibas . Our aim is genuinely to suggest to this new government that we should work with them, side by side. It is up to it to create an institutional framework and to us, the European Union – and here I appeal to Commissioner Rehn and the High Representative – to work with the Libyan authorities to ensure that migrants are treated decently this time and that a distinction is made between asylum seekers and refugees and migrants working in Libya. This is an urgent humanitarian issue, in the best sense of the word.</p>

This matter has to be regulated. A question does arise, however. People used to flee when Gaddafi was in power, and when fighting was under way. Are people still fleeing now or are they attempting to emigrate? The question therefore arises as to whether the new leadership really is what Libyans had hoped for.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on Europe’s southern periphery on the other side of the Mediterranean, there is a strategically important but dangerous region of the world, in North Africa. The Romans called the Mediterranean mare nostrum . Churchill described it as the soft underbelly of Europe. This very clearly shows the extent to which we are dependent on this region.</p>
      <p sl="de">Libya has always occupied a key position in this region: as an energy partner, as a cultural, economic and geopolitical partner, and, not least, as a migration hub into the European Union. That being the case, we are relying on the new governance structures emerging in that country to be stable and democratic, so that we engage in good cooperation with them in all fields. For that reason, we must do our utmost to ensure that Libya’s fledgling democracy is established on a firm footing and assist it to develop an efficient system of governance and administration so that this young state can perform its functions effectively.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards immigration, one priority to keep this in check so that we do not have uncontrollable flows. On the other hand, we must ensure that these people are treated in a manner which is line with human dignity, that they enjoy their fundamental rights, and that Libya ratifies and can actually apply the international conventions which are essential for this purpose. This is not only a task for the democratic parties in Libya. It is also a task for us Europeans. I therefore greatly welcome this resolution because it will have an impact on the entire North African region and, not least, on the countries in the Sahel zone, up to and including Mali.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is an urgent matter and our concerns are prompted by the worrying reports received from several large non-governmental organisations regarding the situation of migrants in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think we can say that, in some ways, nothing has changed for migrants since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, and, for many of them, the situation has worsened even. Suspected almost systematically of being former Gaddafi mercenaries, they have been imprisoned in camps run by ex-rebels. The living conditions there are appalling. We have lost count of the acts of violence and torture towards men, women and children, and there is no authority in Libya today able to put a stop to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union and certain of its Member States in particular bear a heavy responsibility for the current situation, as they blindly entered a conflict without thinking about the consequences. It is regrettable that nothing was said about this subject in the motion for a resolution, especially as NGOs have not been afraid to criticise this responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If I had to pick just one example, I would say that it is quite telling that it took four months to learn the lessons from the July elections and to appoint a new government. Worse still, new agreements are currently being negotiated between the EU, some of its Member States and Libya. There is no doubt that the migration question will be at the centre of these talks. At the very least, Parliament should take a stance and refuse to allow these agreements to be conditional on readmission agreements, the terms of which are familiar to us, but it will not do so. The motion for a resolution is weak, to say the least, particularly in this respect, and that is why my group will not vote in favour of it.</p>

Having lost, they are in a precarious and perilous position. Nevertheless, something has to be done about it and there are three things, I think, that are required:</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we have to try to establish a stable government, which is hopefully developing; we cannot impose it but we can certainly do a lot to help. Secondly, Libya has to sign up to the 1951 Refugee Convention. This will give them status within Libya. And thirdly, where asylum seekers come to Europe and elsewhere the burden must be shared. I listened to the Maltese Prime Minister last week and very generously he said – even though it is a very small country – that they would not turn back any asylum seekers.

Their situation did not improve in any way when that regime was overthrown, and is still desperate. Many foreigners, including pregnant women, small children and unaccompanied minors are still being detained by paramilitary groups and held indefinitely in inhuman and degrading conditions in detention centres or by armed units. The Libyan authorities must ensure that all foreigners, regardless of their immigration status, are protected against violence, exploitation, intimidation and abuse. They must ratify the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and introduce national legislation that is in line with international legislation regulating asylum and the status of migrant workers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Libya has recently gone through a very complex period when, following a difficult civil war, even with material assistance from Europe, there has been a change in the nature of the state administration.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore natural that new, freshly created administrative institutions do not yet have a purpose-built comprehensive state administrative system. On the other hand, however, they should be capable of resolving the country’s most acute problems. In recent times, the situation of foreigners in integrated establishments in Kufra, Benghazi and Tripoli has become particularly critical. The extreme prison conditions to which even women and children are exposed with frequent cases of sexual violence give rise to justifiable concern about the inactivity of Libyan state bodies. It is therefore our duty to press Libya quickly to adopt laws to safeguard international human rights and regularise the position of immigrants in the country so that they are protected against violence, exploitation, threats, intimidation and abuse.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that even the new Libyan administration is aware of the seriousness of this problem.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the motion for a resolution on Libya includes requirements directed at both the new government and European firms operating there. I think that these are justified proposals and recommendations. However, I do not see in the resolution any reference to the main factor complicating the situation not only in Libya, but also in all of the other states where some countries of the European Union have been involved in a change of government and regime change. I believe that we should think carefully about what mistakes we are making with respect to the difficult transformations taking place in Afghanistan, Iraq and now Libya. It is not enough simply to advise, mentor, strengthen the military or humanitarian aid, which often ends up in the hands of a pro-European, politically close, but totally corrupt elite. The question finally needs to be asked, which we do not actually understand in these countries, as to what if our – sometimes even well meaning – advice and actions do not fall on fertile ground, but have a counterproductive effect.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, Libya does not have a functional asylum system, nor is it party to the UN Refugee Convention.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Amnesty reports that foreigners with no papers are in danger of becoming victims of exploitation, arbitrary treatment and also arrests. Especially in this situation where the country is running without a central government, armed military groups and individuals throughout the country have gained the power to decide on the treatment of immigrants, without a legal framework. According to UNHCR, people have been deported from Libya without any opportunity to have their cases processed in a professional manner, even to countries where deportees are targets for persecution, and there is also a large amount of human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU must underline the fact that Libya should protect all people on its territory, including foreigners, regardless of their status, and the government should be able to guarantee humane treatment and also safety from violence. Access to lawyers should also be arranged for foreigners at the stage when they apply for asylum and protection.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, while we welcome the return to political stability after July’s election in Libya, there are worrying reports about detention centres in Tripoli where migrants are allegedly mistreated. Democracy and the rule of law in this country cannot be separated from a functioning judicial system and equal treatment of all its citizens. The European Union must continue to assist Libya’s new democracy by offering financial assistance through its various Neighbourhood Policy instruments. However, we must always underline that our help does depend on the fulfilment of commitments, such as those relating to the principles of the rule of law and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I trust we can develop a good political partnership with Libya’s new government. I endorse Parliament’s call on Vice-President/High Representative Catherine Ashton to develop, together with the Libyan Foreign Affairs Minister, a comprehensive approach to mobility which will make use of the EU toolkit of human rights-based strategies and approaches.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, while the first democratically elected Libyan government has just been formed, we should not forget the fragility of the local situation and the many challenges that remain to be overcome. The terrible conditions and severe human rights abuses faced by migrants should be a priority among these.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am deeply preoccupied by the conditions faced by women and children, especially those who have arbitrarily been put into detention. We have received several reports of sexual and gender-based violence in those detention centres, where pregnant women, women with young children and unaccompanied children are being held alongside adults. Their lack of recourse to adequate protection makes them vulnerable to all kinds of exploitation and violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in Libya was widely discussed in the framework of the last ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in May 2012, and I underlined this tragic situation at that time.

Many international human-rights organisations have reported human rights violations taking place in Libya, and even acts of violence.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Libya should be urged to ratify the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. This would also make it easier for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to operate in the country. Attention should also be paid to the rights of migrant workers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Libya’s geographical location and its well-functioning economy meant that the country became an attractive transit point for hundreds of thousands of migrants, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa. The International Organisation for Migration estimates that migrants represent up to one third of the entire population of Libya, and the majority of them do not hold valid documents. Together with refugees, these illegal residents become the victims of exploitation, racial discrimination, and even physical violence against them by the Libyan population and authorities. They are unable to seek any redress from the relevant authorities or through the courts because they lack official status and entitlement to legal protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The government that came into power in Libya after the revolution promised to deal with human rights and migrants’ rights at the earliest opportunity, and to comply with relevant international standards. Ratification of the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and recognition of other agreements on international standards on respect for human rights would be a major step forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are deeply concerned at the latest reports regarding the situation of migrants, asylum seekers and other vulnerable foreign nationals in Libya. We have raised these issues with the Libyan authorities on a regular basis and will continue to do so in the future. In reply, the authorities have acknowledged the problems and have expressed their readiness to address these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The contradiction between these practices and the values that triggered the 17 February revolution is very clear. The EU supported the Libyan revolution from the outset because it was rooted in values that we share, especially of course respect for human rights and democratic principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union will continue to be a strong partner for Libya during the process of democratic transition. Nevertheless – in this same spirit of partnership – we will not hesitate to convey concerns on issues of fundamental importance, such as those we are discussing today.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time we are sensitive to the complex situation in Libya at present. Over the past four months Libya has undergone a period of political uncertainty with a caretaker government having to deal with numerous challenges, including a major security crisis, not just in Benghazi but in a number of other parts of the country. Moreover, it faces a long list of urgent priorities to address, including state-building, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the revolutionary militias, national reconciliation, the promotion of the rule of law and the protection of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new government was sworn in just over a week ago. We note our full political support to Prime Minister Zidan’s new government and trust he will do his outmost to address the different challenges lying ahead. As is the case for every new government – and in particular for Libya – the authorities need time to put their house in order. Nevertheless, we will not be complacent. We will continue to follow this issue closely. We will continue to press the authorities to ensure respect for human rights standards and we will continue to help them meet their responsibilities under international law. In this regard, I would like to recall that the EU is already providing a EUR 20 million support package aimed at improving the protection of vulnerable groups, including migrants. Further measures and projects in this regard are in the pipeline.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, with regard to our assistance in broader terms, we are also preparing a substantial programme on the security sector reform as well as on the rule of law under the European Neighbourhood Policy instrument, the design of which is being finalised. The overall objective of this programme is to promote the rule of law in Libya by strengthening democratic control and good governance in the security and justice sectors. The specific objective is to respond to the needs expressed by the Libyan authorities in managing the process of democratic transition, especially in the security and justice sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">In my opinion, this is not the best time to have this resolution adopted by the European Parliament, since the first Libyan Government resulting from democratic elections has just been sworn in last week. It obviously needs time to grasp with the many daunting challenges the country faces in a post-war situation. One of the appalling legacies from Gaddafi concerns is the mistreatment of migrants and asylum seekers in Libya: migrants were and are exploited and discriminated, many of them detained under inhumane conditions, subject to torture and barred from access to justice. Yet, the 17 of February Revolution was made to restore dignity and human rights to all in Libya. And Libya is, and will continue to be, a magnet for migrants and asylum seekers from all over Africa. This requires the new democratic Libya to ensure legal protection and respect for the human rights to all foreign workers, asylum seekers and refugees. The EU and the UN must support Libya in this effort, in the framework of assisting its democratic transition. I hope the new Libyan authorities and the Libyan people will take this EP stand in this constructive and cooperative spirit.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is no doubting the importance of this issue; many thousands of migrants face genuine human rights abuses while incarcerated in Libya, and are subject to substantive discrimination when at liberty. But I have real reservations about the timing of this resolution: the new government, the first to be democratically elected in half a century, was sworn in literally a week ago, and has had no opportunity to improve the human rights situation for migrants, or indeed, citizens in general. Nevertheless, it is important that the new government finds ways of regularizing the legal situation of these migrants, or assisting in their safe and orderly return to their countries of origin. I hope that this problem can be resolved satisfactorily, as the new Libya faces many challenges in its reconstruction and transition to a multi-party democracy, and needs all the help from the international community that it can get.</p>
