      <p sl="unknown">I declare the sitting open. I would like to remind you that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, no business shall be transacted while the outgoing President is in the chair unless it is concerned with the election of the President or the verification of credentials, and so today, I am not allowing any comments or discussion. The only thing we can do is elect the President of the European Parliament – that is what it says in our Rules of Procedure.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This morning, in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Procedure, we have to elect the President of Parliament. Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure says that nominations shall be with consent and may only be made by a political group or by at least 40 Members. In accordance with the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following three nominations for the office of President of the European Parliament – I already notified you of these nominations yesterday, but I will read them out again today – Nirj Deva (applause) , Martin Schulz (applause) and Diana Wallis (applause) . I would like to stress that the candidates have informed me that they consent to their candidature.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, we come to the ballot procedure. I would like to ask you not to leave your seats too early, because I am going to give most of the instructions about the ballot in Polish, so if you leave your seats and do not have your headphones, you are not going to hear me.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We now come to the ballot. I would like to remind you that in accordance with Rule 14(1) of the Rules of Procedure, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of the valid votes cast is elected. Blank or void ballot papers are not considered as votes cast. It is a simple rule.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">First, I will proceed to choose eight Members by lot, eight fellow Members whose job it will be to count the votes cast in the ballot. Their names will be drawn by lot from a box containing the names of all the Members.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Here is the box with the names of the Members, and I am pulling out successive names: Borsellino, Sógor, Panayotov, Poc, Bagó, Kalinowski, Kalfin, Perello Rodriguez.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Colleagues, please come and stand behind me on the podium.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I am now giving precise instructions about the ballot. You have also received these instructions by e-mail, but I understand that not everyone has had time to read them, so I will go through the different phases of the ballot. First, ballot papers and envelopes will be distributed. Distribution of the ballot papers and envelopes can now begin.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Now we come to the ballot. May I remind you again that for a candidate to be elected, an absolute majority of valid votes cast is needed. After receiving your ballot papers, please mark the box next to the name of one of the candidates. So we mark the box of the candidate for whom we are voting. You can vote for only one candidate. If two or three candidates are marked, the vote is void. If comments of any kind are added, the vote is void. If you want to change your vote, this can be done. To do so, please return your paper with the vote to the people who are distributing the papers and take a new paper, but you have to give back the old one.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I am not going to read out the names of the Members who vote. Please stay in your seats. What is important here is that the names of the Members who have voted have to be recorded in the Minutes, so please sign the list of those entitled to vote before placing your paper in the ballot box. Please sign the list at the ballot box. I would also ask you to have proof of identity with you and to show it. You should place your ballot paper into the envelope, having first folded it into four. The Members appointed to conduct the ballot and to act as tellers will vote at the end. That is everything. I understand that you have a question about the ballot procedure.</p>

      <a text="(The President established that all those wishing to vote had done so)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">The ballot is closed. Would the Members appointed as tellers please proceed to Room R01101 to begin counting the votes. The sitting is suspended. The sitting will be resumed when the bell rings.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017-000" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Here are the results of the ballot. Members voting – 699, blank or void ballot papers – 29, votes cast – 670, absolute majority – 336. The candidates received votes as follows: Nirj Deva – 142 votes (sustained applause) , Martin Schulz – 387 votes (sustained applause) , Diana Wallis – 141 votes (applause) . Martin Schulz has received an absolute majority of the votes cast and has been elected President of the European Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Loud and sustained applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">the European Parliament will remain the key centre of democratic power in the EU. As parliamentarians, we have an obligation to engage Europeans in our joint undertakings and to be the link to the European institutions. We all count on you, President Schulz, to ensure that the European Parliament will be as it is: the heart of the European debate and the place where European policies are created for the benefit of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would now like to invite you, President Schulz, to come to the podium and replace me in this chair as the newly elected President of the European Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="2-020-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for this overwhelming result. Before the election, for most of you, I was simply the chair of another group in the House. I am honoured by the trust you have shown in me today nonetheless. I will do everything in my power not to betray that trust and to give Parliament a strong voice.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">My aim is to serve in the capacity of President of the Parliament in such a way that those who voted for me can be proud of their choice and so that those who did not vote for me will be pleasantly surprised. I aim to be the President for all Members of the House and I aim to defend your rights.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I would first like to thank Mr Buzek. You were the first President of an EU institution to come from the freedom movements of Eastern Europe and your election and term in office symbolised the victory and triumph of democracy over dictatorship. The dignity with which you have represented this House has demonstrated the unity of Europe in an unparalleled way. I would like to thank you warmly for that, Jerzy Buzek.</p>
      <a text="(Sustained applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I take up this office today with humility. Europe is going through stormy times. These are hard times for many people in Europe. My parents came from a generation whose mantra was: ‘we want our children to have a better life than we have had’. We do indeed have a better life. We no longer have any certainty, however, that life will be as good for our children as it has been for us. Poverty is rife in many countries as a consequence of the economic crisis, and unemployment has reached dramatic proportions among young people in particular. These young people are now protesting on the streets of Europe against an economic system in which a small number of people are making fat profits, while the burden of the losses is being shared out among the public at large, a system in which it seems, particularly in recent days, that anonymous rating agencies in New York are more powerful than democratically elected parliaments and governments. We need to say a decisive ‘No’ to this.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">After all, this leads to a crisis of confidence in the institutions, in politics and in the national and European institutions. This crisis of confidence also threatens people’s belief in the European project. Many people watch us with anger as we go about our work. They are not convinced that what we are doing is right. We must be aware that people in Europe are less interested in institutional debate than in their jobs, their pensions and social justice. They are concerned about healthy food and a clean environment – we in this House must make every effort to listen closely to these people and to pay them greater attention.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">After all, this is the forum where the interests of Europe’s people are represented. This is where we, the representatives of the people of Europe, preside. That is why I say that the people of Europe, who expressed their confidence in us in direct elections, rightly expect us to uphold their interests. I am proudly aware that all of my colleagues in this House see themselves as advocates for their constituents. I would like to thank you all for that.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">For the first time since its foundation, however, there is a realistic prospect that the European Union could fail. For months now, the Union has been lunging from one crisis summit to the next. Again and again, decision after decision that affects us all, everyone of us here in this Chamber, every individual citizen, is being taken by the Heads of State or Government behind closed doors. I see this as a regression to a period in European politics that was believed to be long gone: it reminds me more of the Congress of Vienna in the 19th century. The principle followed at that time was the ruthless pursuit of national interests without any democratic controls.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In contrast, post-war Europe is founded on the sober recognition that our interests can no longer be separated from those of our neighbours; it is based on the recognition that the EU is not a zero sum game in which one side must lose in order for the other side to win. On the contrary: either we all lose – or we all win.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">The fundamental rule here is the Community method. This is not some technical term. The Community method lies at the heart of the European Union. What does it mean, in specific terms? Specifically, it means resolving conflict through dialogue and consensus. It means replacing the right of the strongest powers with solidarity and democracy. It also means balancing interests between small, medium-sized and large states, between North and South, between East and West, and, above all, placing the common good over particular individual interests. That is what European integration is all about. This has been evident in the successful work carried out here over many decades. This community project has sustained some serious damage, however.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Over the last two years, there has not only been a change in how the problems are viewed, but also in the way in which the problems are dealt with. After all, summit meetings and the fixation on meetings between Heads of State or Government largely exclude the single directly elected body in the Community, the European Parliament, from the decision-making processes. In essence, the role of our colleagues in the national parliaments is also downgraded to simply rubber-stamping decisions handed down from on high. As a rule, all they can do is endorse the government decisions made behind closed doors in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The result of a policy that has not been adequately legitimised by Parliament is viewed by the public as a diktat from Brussels. This leads to a situation in which the EU as a whole pays the price. By following this model, we are ourselves guilty of creating a breeding ground for anti-European resentment. It is my hope that the European Parliament will not stand idly by and let that happen.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I am throwing down the gauntlet to anyone who believes that we can have more Europe with less parliamentarianism, and I hope that you will join me in this.</p>
      <a text="(Sustained applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">The intergovernmental agreement on a new fiscal union has been a first test case. During the negotiations, the representatives of Parliament, Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Brok, Mr Gualtieri and Mr Cohn-Bendit, found that Parliament’s call to combine budgetary discipline, on the one hand, with growth and employment, on the other, fell on deaf ears at first. Something is happening thanks to pressure from the European Parliament. My hope is that even more will happen. After all, this rational balance between budgetary discipline and growth is precisely what the public expects. That is why I want Parliament to have a place at the table at European summits. We cannot have a situation in which every institution is invited to attend, while the European Parliament is left out in the cold.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Europe is a community of values. We demand that candidates for accession should strictly adhere to the Copenhagen criteria. I believe that the House must work to ensure that democracy, fundamental rights and freedoms are respected and applied in the Member States as a matter of course. Anyone violating the values of our Charter of Fundamental Rights can expect to meet with our resistance. As a Parliament, we all have an obligation here. In the light of current developments, allow me to add one more thought. Tomorrow, we are to have a controversial debate on the position in Hungary. Prime Minister Orbán has informed the President of Parliament that he wishes to present his view of the matter to the European Parliament tomorrow. I have consulted with the chairs of some of the groups and intend to consult with the remainder. I believe that we should do this. We should accede to Mr Orbán’s request. If the Danish Presidency agrees, he should be given an opportunity to speak tomorrow so that he can explain his view of the matter. This is precisely what I have in mind: the European Parliament must be the forum for controversial debate on the situation within Europe. That is why I believe it is a good idea for Prime Minister Orbán to visit tomorrow. I also believe it would be a good thing if the results that the Commission outlines here were debated by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in such a way that Hungary’s opposition and civil groups would also have a chance to speak. It is doubtless a step in the right direction that at least one Head of State or Government in the EU shares our opinion. The European Parliament is the right forum for controversy in relation to European policy.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I believe that my task as President of Parliament, the head of one of the three central bodies of the EU, is to take a stand against the continuing trend towards summit meetings and the return to national self-interest. I want to play my part in making Parliament more visible and more vocal as a forum for democracy and controversial debate on the direction of policy within the EU. We need to give more weight to our words.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It will be particularly important that we negotiate with the European Council as equals: Parliament has been given enormous additional responsibilities in many areas, whether in regard to the financial perspective, the reform of agriculture, fisheries and regional policy, the combating of climate change, legislation in relation to the financial markets, justice, internal policy and trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Treaty of Lisbon has been in place for two years now and we, as public representatives, have only scratched the surface of what can be achieved through this accord. Our common goal must be to exercise our powers – even in the face of conflict if necessary. If Parliament is to become more visible, then critical debate is essential, for example, in relation to the first-reading agreements. You might say Parliament strikes back. We also need to discuss our own work.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">However, all of this can only work if we put our own house in order first. With the help of our administrators, I intend to ensure that the parliamentary institutions and all Members of the House enjoy the conditions that will enable them to fulfil our legislative functions here as effectively as possible.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I do not intend to be a comfortable President. I will be a President who will demand that the executive respect Parliament, and who will dig his heels in if the interests of our citizens are under threat. I want to be a President who represents a strong Parliament whose Members are dedicated to the concerns of their constituents. A President who will do everything he can to restore people’s dented confidence in the European unification process. I am going to try to reawaken people’s enthusiasm for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Many people have risked everything and too many people have sacrificed their lives to achieve parliamentary rights and parliamentarianism. The first freely elected President of the Constituent Assembly of Tunisia, Mustapha Ben Jafar, together with his colleagues, who are gaining their first experience of the parliamentary process, take the parliaments of Europe, in particular, the European Parliament, as their model.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In Libya, where a despot waged war on his own people, the EU was the first to open an embassy, offering hope to the people there in a difficult situation. When the Sakharov Prize was awarded a few weeks ago, a courageous young blogger and heroic opponent of Gaddafi touched our hearts with her fascination with Europe’s values. In the Middle East, we are constantly asked how Europe has succeeded in turning enemies into allies and how we have managed to grow together into this single Europe, despite our national, religious and philosophical differences. The further you move away from Europe, the better the opinions expressed about it. Let us all work together to recover this enthusiasm for European unification in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Europe is a fascinating idea – an idea that has grown as a response from the second half of the 20th century to the events of the first half of the same century. How could we describe the first half of the 20th century? Hatred, superpower politics, incitement against others, contempt for humanity, the trenches of the First World War, Stalin’s gulags and the gas chambers of Auschwitz were the lowest points in the history of civilisation. In the second half of the 20th century, European unification and the joint institutions within Europe brought the longest period of peace and prosperity in Europe’s history. The Iron Curtain was torn down in 1989. Germany was reunited. In 2004 and 2007, former Member States of the Warsaw Pact joined the EU, restoring the cultural and political unity of a continent that had been artificially divided for 40 years. What a success story this has been. Why have we forgotten to take pride in what we have achieved? Why do we allow people to bad-mouth these unique historical achievements?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">My grandfather fought in the First World War. Twenty years later, my father went to war again when the criminal Hitler regime sent the whole world up in flames. I grew up in a small town near the borders between three countries, where people had to stand in long queues in order to be allowed to cross the border to visit their neighbours in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We have put an end to war and starvation. We have opened the borders. We have outlawed racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Today, we live in a free and open Europe, a Europe that can be proud of its cultural diversity. Let us now arm Europe for the 21st century, so that it will also be a promise of economic strength, social justice and a free and democratic European homeland for the younger generation, for our children and grandchildren. It is up to all of us to do this together.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my dear Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf, I should like to congratulate you and to congratulate our new President. I wish you a great deal of courage, lucidity and strength to guide this institution, which collectively represents 500 million Europeans, in the most dignified and responsible way possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I should firstly like to pay tribute to Nirj Deva and Diana Wallis who also stood as candidates to the Presidency of this institution. I should like to say to them that, although the two main groups in this House took the political decision at the beginning of this term of office to entrust the Presidency of Parliament to one of their own Members in turn, my group respects Mr Deva and Ms Wallis for standing as candidates and thanks them for their contribution to this election.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, this morning, Mr Schulz, I should also like to thank your predecessors and, in particular, Jerzy Buzek, whose capabilities as a statesman, which were already well-known in Poland, have been of great benefit to Parliament. Mr Buzek and, before him, Hans-Gert Pöttering and all their predecessors, starting with Simone Veil, the first President of the European Parliament to be elected by universal suffrage, all of the Presidents here today who have succeeded one another, have, in their own way, strengthened the powers and competences of this institution. Your political action, Mr President, will follow their lead.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, for years we have had the opportunity to work together as chairs of our political groups. For the most part, I do not share your political convictions and our respective political groups have differing opinions on a number of subjects. This has not stopped us from placing our trust in you because, in the difficult situation facing Europe, what brings us together is far more important than what divides us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are determined, as you have just told us, Mr President, to defend the European general interest resolutely in the face of diverse national interests. My group can only support you fully in this mission, in this action, knowing that the coming months will be one of the most critical periods that Europe has experienced since its creation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In our view, you have three priorities: defending the Community method, supporting the Community method and safeguarding the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nothing is more important than defending European heritage, namely, guaranteeing the general interest, protecting the small States from the bigger ones, and respecting their points of view without allowing it to lead to a deadlock. Nothing is more important than coming out of the crisis on top, through greater European integration, and nothing is more important than showing our citizens that the euro will be a strong, sustainable currency, insofar as we are doing what we should have done since its creation, namely, implementing political and economic governance. Finally, nothing is more important than preserving the common good that is solidarity between 500 million Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, by creating what would become the European Union, the founding fathers have left us with a challenge the likes of which has never been seen, namely, uniting the destiny of countries and peoples who, in the past, tore one another apart and fought against one another for centuries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi rose to this challenge, and their successors, to this day, have kept this European dream alive in spite of the economic and internal difficulties, and in spite of a radical shift in the global geostrategic situation. It is our generation’s responsibility not to fail in this task. It is up to us to overcome the financial crisis, the current crisis of confidence, to guarantee our children – and you have said it yourself – not only a viable future, but, above all, a better future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a challenge primarily facing you, Mr President, and us, ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives of the people of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is up to you and us, along with the European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to display enough responsibility to convince our States that shared sovereignty, that real economic and political convergence, are our best tools to face the challenge of growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Schulz, as President of this institution, you will have to face many external challenges, and the PPE Group will be at your side to help you in the European spirit I have just mentioned. We would also encourage you to transmit this message to countries such as Ukraine, where Yulia Tymoshenko has faced unacceptable treatment, or Syria, where the population’s will to change has been unspeakably repressed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are also planning to improve the internal functioning of Parliament and I welcome this. Your predecessors have largely paved the way and the recent adoption of a code of conduct is fully in keeping with the desire for greater transparency and greater responsibility from each of the Members.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group will therefore support you on this front.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, from now on, you will be leading an institution unlike any other in the world: a plurinational Parliament, which votes on legislation. For two and a half years, you shall be the leader of a House that does not seek to impose on the Council the idea that we will not overcome our current difficulties by creating a new treaty, a new Parliament, new governance, but that seeks to convince the Council of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we will join forces behind you each time you defend this integrated Europe, this Europe of solidarity, this Europe that delivers innovative solutions. We will join forces behind you each time you plead the case of common European policies, as well as each time you fight for funding to live up to the ambitions of these common policies. Finally, we will join forces behind you each time you defend and promote the ideas and values that are the foundations of our Union beyond our borders, namely freedom, tolerance, respect for the weakest in society and solidarity. Mr Schulz, I wish you every success in your Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to warmly congratulate you on your election as President of this House. I should like to tell you that it is an honour for our group that a prominent Member, such as yourself, will be leading us throughout this next stage in Parliament at a time – as you have said – of many problems, many threats and many risks for Europe and for Parliament itself: risks for fundamental rights, the unemployment problem, the economic and social crisis, and also the risk that Parliament could lose power by drifting towards intergovernmentalism.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe, however, that, precisely because we are experiencing a difficult period, we need people with special qualities. We need people with great ability and strong European convictions, people with great fighting spirit, and people with great passion to lead a project. Mr President, you are someone who possesses all of these qualities.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have had the opportunity to work with you for some time and I know what I am talking about. I believe that the start of this Presidency in the face of all these conflicts – with you as President of this Parliament – represents an opportunity for us to show that we are capable of getting Europe, which has been drifting somewhat, back on course.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, you are no longer President of our group; today, you are President of all of the Members of this House, but I should like to remind you that what is at stake and what will always be at stake is the issue of building a more united, more democratic, fairer Europe for the people and not for the merchants. I should also like to tell you that you will always find us by your side in the quest towards this objective. I wish you good luck and success in your work.</p>

    <intervention id="2-023-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Schulz, I should like, both personally and on behalf of my group, to congratulate you on your election, but also to congratulate the other candidates who ran in this election. I must add that I enjoyed your first speech, Mr President; even though it started in a slightly social-democratic tone, by the end, it was clear that it really was the President who was speaking. Therefore, I must tell you that you have taken very quickly to your new role.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, allow me, Mr President, to first address your predecessor, Jerzy Buzek, with whom I worked for many years in the European Council. We can both testify to the fact that the climate is much better here, within the European Parliament, than it was in the European Council. I must say, Mr Buzek, that you have carried out remarkable work within Parliament. You have ensured that we adapted to the Treaty of Lisbon which had to be implemented. With Parliament’s help, you have conducted all of the policies needed to combat the crisis. I, and all of the other chairs in the Conference of Presidents, have truly enjoyed how we have been able to cooperate with you. Thank you very much, once again, for all the work you have carried out for this Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, throughout the campaign for the Presidency of Parliament, I heard many of my fellow Members say to me: ‘Yes, what we need is a neutral Presidency. What we need is a President who does not vote. What we need is a President who does not have an opinion’. I must say that I found this belief rather surprising. I prefer to side with those who believe that we need a President who has an opinion and who is not neutral because it is not possible, Mr President, to remain neutral in the face of the rising intergovernmentalism we are seeing today.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">It is not possible, ladies and gentlemen, to remain neutral when we are faced with a Council which continuously devotes itself to denying the Community method and the Monnet method. It is not possible, ladies and gentlemen, to remain neutral when we are faced with constant attacks against the Community method both within the Council and outside it. Nor is it possible, I believe, to remain neutral when we are faced with rising nationalism and populism in Europe, which contradict our European values.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I should therefore like you, Mr President, to be a President, but I should not like you to be a neutral, asexual President without opinions. On the contrary, I should like a President, Mr Schulz, who represents the European Parliament, who represents the European interest without fail, who is different to a President of the Member States and the Council. I should like a President who fights for European integration and – why not say it, let us use the word, we were not able to use it for decades – I should like a President who fights for European federalism as Monnet, Schuman, de Gasperi and Spinelli wished to do.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should especially like, Mr Schulz, if it is possible, a President who speaks to the Member States when he goes to the Council – you will be invited, into this House of the European Council, with all due respect, as President of Parliament – who takes advantage of this opportunity, as your predecessors did, to tell the States the truth and to tell them that only a single fiscal, economic and political Union will save the euro.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Parliament must pave the way to be followed. Parliament must now assume its responsibilities, with the Commission, with the European Central Bank, and pave the way forward to resolve the crisis. It is very clear, it is very simple. Europe is not the problem in this crisis; Europe is the solution to today’s problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I call upon you to indulge your former fellow group chairs and to show some flexibility when it comes to speaking times. In any event, let me remind you that I always overrun my time, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, before explaining my reasons for congratulating you, I would like to thank your predecessors. The Presidents of the European Parliament whom I have known, like Jerzy Buzek, Hans-Gert Pöttering and Mr Borrell Fontelles, have always found their way of doing things, which always seemed to be appropriate to the challenges in hand. I would also like to thank the other candidates because they have once again shown how internal democracy works.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, Mr President, the majority you have now achieved is a qualified majority. There are good reasons for this. In my opinion, what we have here is not a Social Democrat who has been elected to the highest office in the House, but rather a Social Democrat who has been elected to the highest office in the House and who has also been a fantastic parliamentarian.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">You will remember that when you asked me what I thought of the idea of your standing for President of Parliament, I said: ‘What ever gave you that notion?’ I simply could not imagine how Martin Schulz would cope with the diplomatic constraints of this office, as our chief representative. I can imagine it perfectly well now. Firstly, I would like to express the hope that you will not relinquish your particular personal skills and that you will not allow the diplomatic formalities so often required of the President to stifle the spiky pugnacity that has made you such a difficult customer in this House, but that you will retain this bullish attitude in your new office, using it to good effect in your dealings with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, or Mr Van Rompuy, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">The promise that you made in your personal campaign had something touching and almost naïve about it: if this ‘all for one’ principle works, then the principle of ‘one for all’ will work too. Parliament has played its part well today in setting the stage for a new regime. We can now expect serious debate in the House, however, and it will be necessary to prove that not only is Parliament’s new President prepared to take a different approach in debates, but also that Parliament is ready to stick to the objectives that it formulates.</p>
      <p sl="de">This immediately brings me to the present disagreement with Viktor Orbán. Things went wrong during the discussions around the media laws, at a time when a lot still could have been achieved in Hungary. This was mainly because, in the end, Parliament finally left it up to the Commission to deal with the problems. We cannot allow this to happen again in the current disagreement with Hungary. Also, since the name of Yulia Tymoshenko has already been mentioned here, and I expressly applauded, let me say this: we cannot have a situation where Hungary, a Member State of the European Union, abandons the democratic values of the European Union at a time when the people of Russia have started on a path of opposition to controlled democracy and when the Ukrainians are in a desperate situation. Ladies and gentlemen, together with the institutions and our newly elected President, we must do all in our power to prevent this!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Martin Schulz, I believe you are assuming office at a time that is even more difficult than I believed before Christmas. I would never have believed that the last crisis summit really would have had no influence over further developments. I have just returned from Japan, where I saw how the Yen, the currency of a country with enormous problems, has sky-rocketed against the euro. That is not normal. There is no point in complaining about the rating agencies. The problem is that politicians have so little influence, that the rating agencies and the games of Chinese whispers played in the big banks have a bigger influence than political decisions in Europe; this is not normal and we need a calm and consistent approach. I do not believe that the whole Parliament is now populated with Social Democrats. However, many of the ideas for tackling this crisis put forward in this House and supported by a large majority must also be pursued to the end in our dealings with the Council and Commission. We need to put an end to our habit of agreeing to the next compromise before our ideas have even been aired.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I wish you every success. I know that you can be a thorn in people’s sides. On behalf of my group, I can say that we will certainly also play a similar role. I want to make a point here, too, for the women here in Parliament. Following in the footsteps of Simone Veil and Ms Fontaine, it would be wonderful if we, the women in Parliament, started preparing the ground today, so that the next President in the next legislature will be another female President.</p>

      <p sl="en">Herr Präsident – as we shall now have to get used to saying – on behalf of the ECR Group, let me offer you my full congratulations on your election as President of this Parliament and let me also thank Jerzy Buzek for all the work that he has done over the last two-and-a-half years. I have only had the pleasure of working with him for the last few weeks, but certainly he has been an extremely able and competent President and will be an extremely hard act for you to follow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Schulz, you told Der Spiegel magazine just last week that apparently, people are tired of decisions being made behind closed doors. I have to agree with that statement, but it is not without a certain irony given the manner of your election. You had a good majority here this morning; however, your victory was not overwhelming, as I am sure you will have observed. Let me also thank Diana Wallis and my colleague, Nirj Deva, for turning this into an election rather than a coronation. They should both be very proud of the efforts that they have made to have a full debate about the office of President, about what it should involve, and how it should be conducted. Mr Deva obviously fought the election in his typical low-profile manner and we are certainly very pleased with the way that he proceeded!</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, Mr President, you are in the Chair now and we wish you well over your next 30 months in office. From our group, you can expect courtesy, you can expect respect for your office, and we will work constructively with you despite our obvious political differences.</p>
      <p sl="en">I did not agree with many of the statements that you made this morning, but that is a debate we will have on many other occasions, I am sure. That is the nature of democracy: we all respect each others’ points of view even when we differ. I hope that you will treat all groups equally, and all Members equally and with great respect for the elected office that they hold, whatever the section of this House that they come from.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your first major engagement will be representing this House at the European Council meeting in a couple of weeks’ time. I am sure that all the Heads of Government and Presidents are greatly looking forward to hearing what you have to say – after all, they have not heard from many Socialists round the Council table recently, so I am sure they will be pleased to have your reflection on these issues. In that meeting, and in all other meetings that you have to conduct as President, I would like to wish you all the best for your term in office.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Schulz, today, I have the difficult task of standing in for our chair, Mr Lothar Bisky. I am pleased that I have been entrusted with this and that I am, therefore, speaking on his behalf when I, first of all, warmly congratulate you on being elected President. You have achieved a majority in a single round of voting. However, I would also like to extend the warmest thanks to the candidates who stood against you for providing a counterbalance. They have done their very best and I hope that, in the future, we will have many more such occasions where people are willing to stand for President. Personally, I find it rather unfortunate that you are not a woman, but we simply cannot do anything about that now. I hope that you will show your feminine side every now and then.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A lot of Members have voted for you. I am sure that many Members did that with your best interests at heart, but I am equally sure that there are also some Members who thought: let us give Mr Schulz a run for his money. To put it more plainly, you have been elected at a very tough and difficult time, at a time of crisis. I believe that the European Parliament has a very big role to play in this economic and social crisis. We are, in fact, the only institution directly elected by the citizens. At the present time, the citizens are afraid of losing their jobs and pensions, they are concerned about the affordability of health care, about their provision for retirement, but also about the future of their children. My hope is that those citizens are the very people you are planning to give a voice to. That is what I am asking you to do. I am aware that in many bodies of the European Parliament, money and large interests often play the greatest role. Yet those citizens are the people we are actually here to represent.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A lot of agreements are struck behind closed doors, where the public cannot see the negotiation process. I hope that you will ensure that that process becomes more transparent, but also that, during that process, you will articulate the full variety of views of the groups in the European Parliament, both large and small. You are, after all, the President of us all. We from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will call you thoroughly to account in that regard and I wish you great reserves of wisdom in the coming period.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President – President Schulz – good morning to you. I know it is my job to congratulate you but, given that we knew this result two-and-a-half years ago, as a result of a stitch-up, there really does not seem to be much point. After all, nobody in modern-day Europe would ever have a big, powerful job that was decided upon by a full, open process. I am sure Mr Barroso would agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was musing this morning. I was thinking about what kind of President Schulz we were going to get. Are we going to get a dignified, calm figure who behaves like the Speaker of all great parliaments around the world, somebody who puts himself above politics and the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day arguments and is an ambassador, indeed a statesman? Or are we going to get the Martin Schulz we have got to know since 2004 as leader of the Socialist Group? You know the one I mean: snarling, angry, unable to control his temper, intolerant of anybody with an alternative point of view, somebody who is contemptuous when, in free referendums, people have the temerity to vote ‘no’, somebody who is anti-British to his fingertips and does not like free markets? I was wondering which one we would get. Well, your opening speech has settled that question for me. It is pretty clear that we are going to have two-and-a-half years of political fanaticism from the Chair. I have to say that only a third-world country, only a banana republic, would want to have an overtly political President of a parliament, but that is what we have got.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Schulz, I may represent the smallest group in this Parliament, but I can tell you that it is a group whose ideas and whose views are now being echoed by a growing number of citizens right across this continent. I am sure you would agree that the opinion polls show that it is about 50-50 whether people think this EU is a good thing or a bad thing. What we represent is not anti-Europeanism. That is not what it is about. We believe in nation-state democracy. We want a Europe of trade, we want a Europe of cooperation and we want a Europe that is responsible. We do not want a Europe that seeks to be a global superpower. We do not want a Europe run by Mr Barroso and the Commission, and the so-called Community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will do my very best to provide political opposition to your Presidency over the next two-and-a-half years and I hope you give us a fair hearing.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Schulz, I would, first of all, like to congratulate you on the election deal struck two and a half years ago, thanks to which you now find yourself sitting in that seat. I must congratulate you on that, on behalf of my group. I find it unfortunate, though, that we have not had a debate about your election. We would have liked to have had one, but all right, it seems that the outcome was determined in advance. You have emerged the winner at the ballot box, so you are the person that we will be dealing with.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Around a year ago, you unfoundedly denounced a member of my group as a fascist in this Chamber, which is conduct unbefitting a democratic parliamentarian. You have never attempted to distance yourself from those words. You said that loud and clear in this Chamber and that kind of rhetoric is not to your credit. I find that really unfortunate and I hope that you now want to take those words back because, Mr President, a democracy is only a democracy if dissenting opinions are allowed to be heard unimpeded. There is, obviously, no reason to call someone a fascist and there is no place for such words in this Chamber. We have all been democratically elected and we are also democrats at heart, and, as such, we must also respect each other.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this European Union is bankrupt. The citizens have never had so little faith in the future of the European Union. More and more people want sovereignty returned to Member States. Small countries can definitely be prosperous and cooperate peacefully – because that is precisely where Europe’s strength lies – under the military flag of NATO. Therefore – sorry, Mr President – but all that war rhetoric is inappropriate. Fortunately, we have had decades of peace in Europe, at least in our part of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, the megalomaniac Europe of the social democrat Schulz is bankrupt. Europe is lagging far behind, it is corrupt and wasting money. We all need to do something about that. Mr Schulz, I hope that you will also be, or rather become, our president, that you will leave your Social Democratic past behind you and that you will stand above all the group divisions. I hope that you will show yourself to be a worthy President and that you will show respect for all the democratic currents represented in this Parliament. While the non-attached Members do not belong to any one group, they have been democratically elected and are entitled to equal treatment from our President and everyone else in this House.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, although we do not share your vision of a European social-democratic utopia – for we believe in the power of sovereign nations – we still want to get our cooperation with you off to a good start. I therefore wish you success in your new role. You would make a very nice start if you finally delivered on a long cherished wish of this Parliament, namely, the abolition of the travelling circus, that wasteful travelling circus that shuttles between Brussels and Strasbourg. Mr President, that is what I wanted to convey to you. It would be a nice touch if you could clinch that at the next summit. I wish you every success in your new role as President. We will do our best to get your presidency off to a good start.</p>

    <intervention id="2-030-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Schulz, honourable Members, I would like to express my warmest congratulations to Martin Schulz on his election as President of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1994. Since then, this House has frequently profited from his strong character, his great political skill and his untiring commitment to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">He rightly has an ambitious vision for the role of this House. He also rightly demands that Parliament’s voice – the voice of the people of Europe – should be listened to more closely than has been the case in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">Martin Schulz – and with him the whole European Parliament – can continue to count on the support of the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">Indeed, today it is more important than ever to reinforce European democracy. Those who, at national level, pretend that democracy can only be national have not yet understood that we are already in the age of globalisation, that we are living in the 21st century. Those who resist the idea of European democracy – and indeed the idea of European sovereignty – on the basis of national sovereignty are handing over the real sovereignty to anonymous operators in the markets, who are subject to no democratic control.</p>
      <p sl="de">Indeed, in this time of crisis, when the challenges before us are great, it is more important than ever for the different political forces to work together for a strong Europe. In this spirit, I would also like to pay tribute to the other candidates who stood in this democratic election, Diana Wallis and Nirj Deva.</p>
      <p sl="de">A word of sincere thanks is also due to the outgoing President, Jerzy Buzek. President Buzek has presided over this Parliament in an impressive and principled manner in historic and testing times. During his term of office, we have seen the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, as well as the most challenging economic and political period of the European Union’s history. Thanks to the very good and close cooperation between our two institutions over the past two-and-a-half years, we have laid the foundations for a sound and trusting special partnership between Parliament and the Commission, which is now part of our common acquis .</p>
      <p sl="de">But there is more than this. President Buzek was the first President of a European Union institution to come from one of the central and eastern European Member States – the first since the fall of the Iron Curtain. His presidency symbolised that the dream of millions of people, the dream of freedom for millions of Europeans, had come true. Mr Buzek, many, many thanks for this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, our responsibility at present is to implement fully the decisions taken to make Europe stronger, more competitive and more unified. Measures to promote financial stability and economic growth are what must be our main priorities over the coming months. Europe cannot be built on discipline and sanctions alone. Europe must be built on convergence, solidarity and hope. That is precisely why growth is increasingly important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Hope must also triumph over cynicism and disillusionment and we must clearly reaffirm our shared desire to live together. However, the sacrifices demanded by the crisis must also be divided more equally, so that the poorest and the middle classes are not always the ones who pick up most of the tab for the crisis. Social justice is also an essential factor in the success of our response to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, in these very difficult, but also exciting times, I wish you every success and you can rely on the unfailing commitment and the full and loyal cooperation of the European Commission to bring Europe out of this crisis stronger and more unified than ever.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Dear colleagues, thank you for your kind words – and for the less kind words, thank you as well. This is an emotional moment for me and for a lot of my friends. If you will allow me, in addition to my thanks to all of you, I shall make a personal observation. As I mentioned, I shall try to be the President of all of you, irrespective of your political and group affiliations. This is a duty and it is a promise.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I thank you, President Barroso. I think the complementarity in the action of the community institutions is not only necessary, it is vital for the European Union, and you can count on the European Parliament – or at least on the overwhelming majority of the European Parliament including, especially, on me – as your future ally in this fight to defend the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, the words you have addressed to me are, for me, very emotional. It is a responsibility of the highest importance that the President of the European Parliament should be a President of all the Members. I think everybody who knows me knows that I remain a social democrat, but I am not the president of social democracy in Europe: I am the President of the European Parliament. I assure you once more that my duty is to defend the interests of this House.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">There is an additional point I would like to make and I would ask for your understanding here. This is an emotional moment for me, and not just for me. Here in this Chamber are a lot of my friends, not only on the floor of the House but also in the gallery. A former teacher from my school, when I was a seven-year-old-boy, is here. There are friends from my football team – which was not the most successful one, but was the best in my life. There are my friends from the city council, the former mayor of my city, the current mayor – my successor and my predecessor in the mayor’s office. The mayor of Aachen, my home city, is here. My friends and my family are here. I hope that you will allow me to welcome all of them. They are a part of my life.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen and former Presidents of Parliament, for being here today. It is an honour, not only for me, but for the European Parliament. It is a great pleasure, and seeing you here before me, I realise how long I have already spent as a Member of the European Parliament. I have had the privilege of being a Member under each one of your Presidencies, except that of Enrique Baron, who was President before I became a Member of the European Parliament, and who was my predecessor as President of the socialist group at the time. Thank you very much for being here and for honouring us with your presence, on behalf of myself and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. There is one new thing that I would also like to show you: I believe that we must work together to improve our image and that it is hardly flattering when everyone comes back into the Chamber talking with their fellow Members, while the Commission and the Council are still speaking, or when other Members still have the floor. The President has always tried and failed to call order with a gavel … I have therefore decided to use a bell in the future. I believe this is a first step towards being better understood than before.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would ask you to wait a moment longer because I have several procedural matters to raise. Thank you very much for all of your kind words and support.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, before we convene this afternoon, I feel a great need, in my capacity as newly elected President of the European Parliament, to extend an offer to my fellow candidates. Mr Deva and Ms Wallis, because everything has been so fair and above board during the election campaign, I would like to keep in contact with you. When I saw all the blue and yellow balloons when I came in this morning I mistakenly thought I was witnessing a demonstration in support of Yulia Tymoshenko, until I realised it was Nirj Deva’s campaign. Diana, I hope we stay in contact because the contributions you made to the discussion and debate on the future of this Parliament during our election campaign were very important. I would hope that some of your ideas can be included in my own work, the outcome of the election notwithstanding. Thank you very much for this fair and open debate. I would be very pleased to work closely with you in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not really a point of order, but I am amazed that a vote at the Parliamentary Assembly should be held in conditions that do not objectively guarantee a secret ballot.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is unthinkable to have to vote in a House surrounded by Members who are able to see how their neighbours are voting. Every Parliamentary Assembly has booths installed at voting time in order to allow a secret ballot. I am not asking for this to be done if the ballot takes place tomorrow, but I would be pleased if you would bear my comments in mind for the future.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">That concludes the ballot. The result of the ballot will be announced this evening. If a third ballot is required, it will be held tomorrow morning.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I would draw your attention to the fact that a relative majority is required in the third ballot, in other words, a quorum with an absolute majority is not required, so that candidates will be elected according to the relative majority of the votes cast.</p>
