      <p sl="de">Mr President, you are an excellent President of this House, but I would like to protest about the people who plan our work here. We have known since last week that there was very little on the agenda today. Why then can the people planning the work not be so flexible as to give us better speaking times? I would gladly listen to Mr Brok, Mr van Nistelrooij, Mr Surján and others for five or ten minutes to allow them to make a substantial contribution. That would make sense. Thus, I would make an earnest plea. Many of my fellow Members would have gladly spoken today if a more sensible and flexible approach had been taken.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I take that comment very seriously. I have Mr Rouček with me, who will now chair the discussion, and will certainly be able to add time to your speech as necessary. Maybe not five minutes if the time allocated is two minutes, but let us say that we can exceed the time of the speech by 50%. This is a lot. If someone has been allocated two minutes, they will now have three minutes. This is a big change.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we know that you are a good President. Nevertheless, I would ask you to stick to the set timetable. I have a group of visitors, but I would like to speak during catch-the-eye. If you now allow Mr Posselt, Mr Brok and Mr van Nistelrooij to speak for five minutes then I will not be able to do that. Perhaps they could speak after the catch-the-eye procedure, as all MEPs have a particular timetable and we have to plan our day.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, cross-border cooperation has been one of the main innovations under the Instrument for European neighbourhood policy. Back in 2006, we adopted a regulation which, for the first time, saw the full transposition of EU cross-border cooperation experience in an external relations environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">We wanted the new programmes to be jointly designed and jointly managed by Member States and partner countries. We wanted to fully involve local actors and ensure that projects were jointly selected and implemented. We saw this as a way of empowering local authorities, promoting local development and ultimately strengthening local democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We never said that this was going to be easy. We never said that this was going to be quick. Borders are basic elements of sovereignty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The benefits of cross-border cooperation and the way it works had to be explained to partner countries and its implementation mechanisms adapted to take into account their administrative and legal constraints. A way around sensitive foreign policy issues had to be found, and this was not always possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was not possible to persuade Morocco to participate in programmes for which Ceuta and Melilla were eligible. It was not possible to persuade Azerbaijan to participate in the Black Sea Programme alongside Armenia. It was not possible to find a way to overcome the political and technical obstacles which led Russia to decide not to participate in the Baltic Sea Programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is regrettable, but as you can see we are confronted here with long-standing policy issues reflecting core national interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the glass is more than half full. As we speak, we have 13 programmes operational. They cover the entire European Union land border, the sea crossing between Italy and Tunisia and the three big sea basins that the EU shares with its neighbours: the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Russia has also agreed to co-finance the programmes in which it participates with over EUR 100 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under all of these programmes we have now launched calls for proposals for an amount of EUR 275 million. The response to these calls for proposals has not been poor. On the contrary, it has been excellent. We are receiving hundreds of applications; almost six times more than we can finance. 598 proposals were submitted under the MEDA Programme alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">We expect that the funds will start to flow to the beneficiaries soon and we foresee no absorption problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is now in the process of undertaking a mid-term review of the Cross-Border Cooperation Strategy Paper and the Indicative Programme. There are a number of adjustments we need to make, including to the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the two programmes between Spain and Morocco will be cancelled. The European regional development component of the budget will go back to Spain to be used by Spain in accordance with the Structural Funds Regulation. The ENPI component has been reallocated to other ENPI programmes in the Southern Neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we are considering reducing the ENPI allocation to the Baltic Sea programme. This may provide some extra funds to increase the budget of other Sea Basin programmes. Given the small amount involved, we do not expect equivalent matching funds from the European Regional Development Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand you have concerns about duplication of financing between cross-border cooperation and other ENPI programmes. We will also review that aspect, but I have to say that the risk is small because (a) the CBC programmes have a clear territorial focus and (b) we systematically screen all the selected projects to avoid that problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is about to start a reflection on the ENPI with a view to the legislative proposal for a revised regulation that it intends to table in late 2011. In this context, we will consult practitioners and stakeholders to see what shortcomings have been identified and how they can best be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, implementing the ENPI cross-border cooperation component has been an enormous challenge. We have lived up to it and we are about to see the results. I am persuaded that it will be a success.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have encountered difficulties that have caused delays, but we need to remember that these difficulties were mostly related to difficult foreign policy issues rather than implementation problems. We are about to review the way ENPI works, and there we share the same goal. The Commission, as much as the European Parliament, wants to have programmes that are easier to prepare and can be implemented faster.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is ready to work in close consultation with the practitioners, the stakeholders and the European Parliament to that effect.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, in 2005 and 2006, within Parliament and with the Commission, we cooperated quickly and intensively on achieving the objectives of the European neighbourhood policy, including the objective of cross-border cooperation for citizens living in the regions concerned. To do so, we had to be very creative and remain very close to the people. We took the view that the position of the people living at the external borders had to be no worse than that of citizens living at the internal borders. In addition, we had years of relevant experience within the Interreg programmes, and our expectations were high.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Parliament’s engagement is still as great. Yet a few years are needed to get going, and that has been the case here too. Article 30 of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) Regulation lays down that the Commission is to present an evaluation and proposals for modification, and so on, by 31 December 2010. I should like to know whether you are on track with this. Do you mean to comply with the Regulation in this respect? When can we expect to receive this conscious evaluation, as we agreed together?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second point concerns the answers to the questions on cross-border cooperation. These questions were intended to help us catch up – which, indeed, we are now doing. You have made a tremendous effort, and I am indeed satisfied with your answers regarding the cooperation around the Baltic Sea and that on the Spain-Morocco Programme.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is the situation now, though? Our Committee on Regional Development presented an interim report back in mid-2009. This included a number of suggestions for striking a better balance that was closer to the people – more decentralised – between financial, planning and bureaucracy inputs on the one hand and the benefit to the people on the other. However, the report revealed that this balance had not quite been struck. We were mired in generalities for a long time and were slow to launch specific projects.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My question, therefore, is as follows: can we now discuss such improvements together in the context of that evaluation? My idea is to proceed along familiar lines in the work of this House – we are in possession of a study – and to hold a hearing in Parliament with the parties concerned from the border regions, perhaps an association of European border regions, the people living in the regions and their representatives. This will enable us to hold discussions with one other, not about outlines or objectives but about constituting a specific evaluation of how well the contacts, for example between universities, hospitals or schools, have got off the ground in the field of the environment, water and so on. That could lead to a real debate – to which we are giving only a small impetus today – on the new programming period and on the crucial issue of what resources are needed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is my objective, and I should like to invite my fellow Members to take part in today’s discussion, in order to improve the overall situation and also to make ourselves visible to people in the border regions. I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his answers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ensuring a stable and prosperous neighbourhood is the first priority of European foreign policy. It is in its neighbourhood that the EU can best exercise its soft stabilising power. It is also there that it needs to assess strategies and possibly replace them with other more relevant forms of engagement.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the ENPI Regulation, the objective of the instrument is to provide Community assistance for the development of an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness. However, the ENPI should reflect better the needs and challenges. If the EU wants to be seen not just as a cash cow, but as a real regional power, it will also need to prove itself able to help resolve conflicts through this work and in the neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">Stability and prosperity are periodically threatened by the resurgence of unresolved conflicts. These undermine to a great extent the EU’s multilateral initiatives, both in the east – for instance in the Caucasus – and in the south – the Middle East and Western Sahara, for example. The EU’s ambition to resolve and step up its role should be realised, and tailor-made assistance in these regions should be directed at confidence building and reconciliation as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The focus on bilateral relations has made it difficult for the Union to act as a mediator in conflicts. The EU should really focus more on multilateral cooperation, no matter how difficult it is, as Commissioner Füle stated. The regional approach should be stronger and more visible. It should be combined also with enhanced cooperation among the partner countries themselves, especially among the neighbouring ones. For example, the degree of cooperation integration in the EU eastern neighbourhood is quite low. There are reasons for this, there are difficulties with this, but we should act together to overcome them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The CBC Black Sea initiative seems not to be enough to address all this. The definition of the cross-border cooperation aim is to promote economic and social development in border areas, address common challenges, ensure efficient and secure borders and promote people-to-people cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Better coordination should also be ensured between the ENPI and the cross-border cooperation programmes and the national ENPI action plan. There should be careful consideration about the real added value of every ENPI initiative, otherwise the EU risks getting involved, and even getting lost, in the obligation and overlapping, which currently happens often with a number of Community programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Füle has given us some reassurances in this respect. Consultation of stakeholders and closer work with the Committee on Regional Development in Parliament should help. We should work together for more effective and visible results.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Commissioner mentioned among other things his concern over the delays in presenting and launching the cross-border cooperation projects. I would like to point out that there are five land border programmes involving the Russian Federation as a partner country operating within the framework of the ENPI during the period 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="de">I find it extremely commendable that the European Union and Russia have engaged in such an extensive cooperation in order to further develop their strategic partnership. Nevertheless, at the moment, there are serious and justified concerns over the timely use of budgets, since all defrayals must be executed by 2014 at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="de">It should be noted that, in the case of Russia, there is an imminent threat that most of the available funds will remain unused since there are no ongoing projects and the first goal for proposals was launched as late as this year. I would like to ask the Commissioner to explain the situation of the CBC programmes with Russia specifically, and to give his view on whether the framework of the European Territorial Cooperation Programmes would not make a better basis for implementation of the external cross-border cooperation programmes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), two out of thirteen cross-border cooperation programmes are dedicated to the Mediterranean Basin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is the cooperation programme for the Mediterranean Basin. With the new generation of European funds for 2007-2013, the European Union has decided to resolutely develop cooperation actions between the north and south shores of the Mediterranean. To this end, the European Union has established the Mediterranean Sea Basin ENPI programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What territories exactly does this programme apply to? What projects could be co-financed, given that we know that the cooperation programme finances 80% of the total cost of the cooperation programmes in which partner programmes representing at least three eligible countries in a very wide range of fields participate?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second part of the ENPI cross-border programme for Italy and Tunisia has a total allocation for 2007-2013 of EUR 25 191 million. The eligible regions are in Italy and Tunisia. The management authority is the region of Sicily, with Palermo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The objective of the cross-border cooperation programme for Italy and Tunisia is to encourage economic, institutional and cultural integration of the Tunisian and Sicilian regions through a process of joint sustainable development in the context of cross-border cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The programme has three priorities. The first is regional development and regional integration. The second is to encourage sustainable development, through the management of agricultural and fisheries resources, to protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage and to encourage the development of renewable energy sources. My question is as follows: what measures have been put in place to monitor the trade in coral, a fisheries resource that is endangered and the subject of illegal trafficking?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third priority is cultural and scientific cooperation, and support for networks, by strengthening cooperation at association level, training and exchanges between young people and students. My question is as follows: how, beyond the objective of funding, do we ensure that this programme of human exchanges takes place given the obstacles associated with the implementation of the Return Directive by European countries and the management of Schengen visas?</p>

      <p sl="pl">After the experience of the past few years one thing is clear – cross-border cooperation within the context of the neighbourhood policy does not work. It has not been a success. Beyond a doubt, we must clarify the responsibilities of individual administrative institutions dealing with regional development, the neighbourhood policy and cross-border cooperation. Beyond a doubt, we must do something with our procedures as they are currently frightening off the regions, both European and neighbouring regions, from cooperation with the Directorate-General for External Relations. We must bring these institutions closer together.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is also another problem. Apart from these procedural changes which are necessary, we must also do something about creating greater political transparency within the neighbourhood policy. We can clearly see that Morocco is not particularly overjoyed that it must function within the same political and financial framework as the countries of Eastern Europe. We can clearly see that Russia on the one hand wants neighbourhood privileges, but on the other treats its neighbours as European imperialists. Anyway, we certainly encourage her by constantly offering her an extremely privileged status, for example within the framework of the Partnership for Modernisation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore we have two problems to solve: firstly, procedural changes, secondly, political changes, so everyone will know what the idea of neighbourhood is based on. Is this a substitute for membership? Is this a step towards membership, or is it quite the opposite, a step towards weakening political relations between Europe and its neighbouring countries?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the evaluation of the implementation of the European neighbourhood policy is not surprising. The evaluation is quite positive in view of the concerns of those who are currently governing Europe. Everything is fine. Trade is developing, so the most important thing is being preserved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Granted, this evaluation reveals some regrets from a social point of view and from the point of view of democracy and human rights, but only to say that the insufficiencies in this area hold back economic development and – I quote the evaluation by the Commission itself – that it is admitted that social cohesion creates a better climate for business.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am sure that no-one here is shocked by this way of tackling the problems. I personally think that this reveals a great deal about the European integration that the European Union is seeking to impose on its close neighbours, this Europe of double standards in which our fellow citizens are finding it increasingly difficult to recognise themselves and which they are increasingly giving up on at each election, when they do not take refuge in voting for extremists.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, the evaluation of the neighbourhood and partnership policy is at least mitigated once we look at how these policies have resulted in improvements for the populations concerned. The glass is not half empty or half full, Commissioner. The scales are tipped to the wrong side.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What real progress has been made in terms of democracy and human rights? Go and talk to the people who live in these areas and are fighting for democracy in these countries and are even risking their lives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What progress has been made in Tunisia in this area? How can we envisage a stronger partnership with countries that openly ride roughshod over democracy and human rights?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same goes for Israel. Why does the European Union not take advantage of this special relationship, this partnership, to use all its clout to make Israel respect its international commitments and put an end to its occupation of the Palestinian territories? This has gone on for 45 years. The European Union must make its voice heard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why does it not do the same thing with Morocco to resolve the issue of the Western Sahara? Also, how does the Commission dare to envisage a stronger partnership with Libya? I think I know the answer. It is so that they can play their role as the guardian of Europe. The fate of those who are sent back there is of little concern to them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It will soon be 10 October, Commissioner. 10 October is the European Day Against the Death Penalty. I would like to make a symbolic statement here today: when will the European Union stop sending men, women and even children back to these countries, including those that still use the death penalty? When will it demand that these countries at least ratify the 1951 Refugee Convention? When will it demand that these countries have a moratorium on the death penalty?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Economic relations with these countries are important, but they are just as important for them as they are for us. They must serve the people and not their corrupt governments. What image are we projecting of Europe when we constantly prioritise Europe’s economic and security interests over the concept of democracy and human rights?</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the European Union does not have a change of heart in this area we should not be surprised if the universality of human rights is increasingly considered as a form of neo-colonialism, like the desire to impose a so-called Western model. We need a better image for Europe. The neighbourhood policy could be a tool for achieving this. This is not the case, which is something that I deeply regret.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, what is the Commissioner thinking about? Has the Commission been asleep for the last two years? Here we are, at a time of economic stringency, despite what Mr Van Rompuy said this week. There are millions out of work, some newer Member States have still not got the promised financial package, and Germany has a billion-euro bill round its neck to underwrite the Greek economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Britain, my government is raising taxes, freezing public sector pay and pensions and cutting back on welfare while finding GBP 45 million every day for this place. And now you want to spend EUR 1.1 billion of hard pressed European taxpayers’ money on a programme to help partner countries along the EU borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is that what you mean by more Europe – or is it an attempt to draw these countries into the EU? It sounds like empire-building to me. After all, José Barroso himself called this an empire. We are told that the EU is to prevent further wars in Europe, but if you look at the record you will find that such wars were due to the empire-builders. Now you are doing it all over again. Do you never learn?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in my opinion, if doubts are now starting to be expressed more or less openly in many Balkan countries about their own accession perspective, it serves to demonstrate the weaknesses of the European neighbourhood policy, as the countries of the Western Balkans that have a European perspective and those countries with which accession negotiations are already underway are not, of course, included in this neighbourhood policy. The course of the accession negotiations is, naturally, heavily dependent on fulfilment of the accession criteria, as we know. This is crucial, in particular when we consider the rushed enlargement involving Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, peace on Europe’s doorstep is, without doubt, more important for the EU than peace in far off Afghanistan. In my view, therefore, we ought once again to focus our own efforts on unresolved conflicts in Europe involving our neighbours and at our borders.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to peace efforts in the Balkans, an improvement in relations with Russia is also important. This is another country that has not been included in the European neighbourhood strategy, although it is an important strategic partner for Europe, not only in terms of energy supply. We need to work on our relations with Russia now, before the next gas dispute or the competition between Nabucco and South Stream has a chance, in the worst case scenario, to lead to a deepening of divisions. Our dependency on Russian gas will remain for a long time yet. Nabucco and supplies from other countries will probably only be able to replace one dependency with other ones. That, in my opinion, would be a bad thing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under no circumstances must neighbourhood policy, with the creation of free trade zones as preparation for adoption of the aquis , degenerate into an automatic preparation for accession. That is why, in my view, we ought at last to put a stop to the accession negotiations with Turkey, which is not a European country and the Islamicisation of which will probably progress further following the most recent constitutional reform.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this subject is a classic example of where regional policy and foreign policy coincide. In this regard, we need to show the necessary flexibility to enable us to implement regional policy – including with the experience of regional policy that we have within the European Union – but at the same time also to combine this with foreign policy ideas. This is not an aggressive act against anyone or a question of zones in which we want supremacy, but it is a classic example of an area where we can develop a strategy in which we recognise that border regions have always been zones of conflict, including within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we succeed in successfully tackling border regions so as to eliminate minority conflicts and social and economic divides and hence make the transitions smoother, it would bring about an enormous degree of stabilisation from a wider foreign policy perspective. If, as the European Union, we also achieve closer relations with these countries then this seems to me to be important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I believe that with a lot of what we need to develop – namely to also incorporate neighbourhood policy better into a strategic concept and not get bogged down in technical details, and I have the impression that this is the aim of your work – the different opportunities we have to make progress here can be combined in one specific approach. I would therefore like to invite you to also view this in a wider context as a strategic concept and perhaps also to take it into account in your team. You will have our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Implementation of the administrative flexibility that is needed for this – as what applies to one country does not have to apply to the next one, and if we have Russia on board in this, we will perhaps have to have a flexible solution here, too, that cannot be found using a catch-all method – is difficult for any administration. However, you can count on the fact that we are prepared to do this. If you bring us your assessment of this matter that is scheduled for the end of the year, we will happily add our insights in a hearing or by other means, to enable us to develop a common strategic concept for the Union for the benefit of the citizens on both sides of the borders.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Commissioner Füle, I agree with my fellow Members, like Mr Brok who spoke before me, who say that cross-border cooperation has considerable potential. I was a member of the national Parliament from a constituency on the Hungarian-Serbian border for almost 15 years, or, to be exact, my work brought me close to this area. I know first-hand that cross-border cooperation has a great deal of potential. There is a basic contradiction, namely that despite Hungary’s EU membership, regional cooperation within the European Union provides very little opportunity for cooperation between Hungary and Vojvodina, this particular province of Serbia. There is a fundamental contradiction, Commissioner Füle, which has been discussed today: states such as Serbia, which would like to accede to the European Union, can no longer be part of this framework, while on the other hand, it is extremely important for us to bring the Western Balkans closer, to cooperate with Western Balkan countries, to facilitate cooperation between Romania and its Western Balkan neighbours and between Hungary and its Western Balkan neighbour, Serbia. Therefore there is a priority problem here, and I fully agree with Mr Brok that the strategy of the entire policy should be reviewed. As a Czech, you are very familiar with the central part of Europe, the Balkans and Eastern Europe, our eastern neighbours. This has a great deal of potential. This is very important for the issue of ethnic minorities, as Mr Brok pointed out. Cross-border cooperation is not only necessary because it is the only way to solve certain environmental pollution issues, and this applies to the Baltic states, the countries along the Danube and the Black Sea region. It is also important to interethnic relationships, for instance where ethnic minorities living in a different country are concerned. In the case of Hungary, this involves for instance the relationship of the 180 000 Hungarians living in Ukraine and Hungary, or the relationship between the Ukrainians living in Hungary and Ukraine. The same applies in the case of Vojvodina and the Serbs. Regional cooperation has a significant potential to stabilise the region, but we are not exploiting this opportunity yet. I would like to ask Mr Füle, and I have complete confidence in him, to review the earlier concept in this respect, and I trust we will have a much broader neighbourhood policy in the future, which will better promote the interests of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, cross-border cooperation programmes are and will be absolutely crucial to improved and closer cooperation in the EU border regions. Administering these programmes under the heading of external relations, however, has proven problematic, and the special features of cross-border cooperation are not always taken into account. It is probably worth considering whether their administration might, in the context of future financial frameworks, be transferred, for example, to the Commission’s Directorate General for Regional Policy, applying, say, the very effective programme principles of the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Russia is visible in these ENPI programmes as an equal partner. At the moment Russia is, as far as I know, the only country which is not a member of the Development Assistance Committee, whose programmes are still being managed by DG EuropeAid. The question is: does it have sufficient experience of European regional cooperation?</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, including its cross-border cooperation programme, is a very important Community initiative combining features of international and inter-regional cooperation. It deserves our continued support as it allows regions situated near the outermost borders of the European Union to draw closer. A prerequisite for this, however, is that the instrument’s procedures are streamlined, and that clear, intelligible rules for its functioning are set out.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is a good thing that the majority of resources provided within the framework of the instrument are earmarked for cooperation with countries within Europe, that is, Ukraine and Belarus. In this context, we should exert further pressure on the Belarus authorities so that they finally take note of the citizens who are calling for pluralism and democracy. Positive signals from the regime concerning a readiness to implement reforms would allow the full exploitation of the EUR 228 million provided within the framework of the agreement, and would also permit Belarus to participate fully in all aspects of cooperation within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. However, should Mr Lukashenko’s regime not be ready for cooperation, we should consider the transfer of these resources to regional cooperation with Ukraine.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, the Commissioner said that fundamental national interests prevent the development of desirable cooperation with certain countries. I accept that there may be such interests, but I believe that governments in favour of confrontation rather than cooperation have misinterpreted their fundamental national interests. This interpretation of the state's role clearly contradicts the interests of citizens living on both sides of the borders, who are certainly in favour of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We can recall Jean Monnet’s frequently cited saying, that we build a union between people, not states. This is the direction we must follow. Moreover, the situation is further complicated by the fact that there are relatively large numbers of European citizens living beyond our borders, that is, beyond the external borders of the European Union, such as in Moldova. There is no doubt that cooperation between Romania and Moldova is vital and will also improve the relationship between the two countries.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Commissioner, I am not convinced that only these misinterpreted government and political factors prevent the perfect and harmonised use of this measure. I believe the administrative side should also be reviewed in depth and progress should be made in this area, as well. We are looking forward to this review by the Commission, and it will be particularly important to see the effectiveness of the programme. We are spending European citizens’ money, and we can only spend it with a clear conscience if programmes are effective and bring results. This is a very important issue. Where cross-border cooperation is concerned, the message we are sending to those living beyond our borders is not that we want to integrate them into an empire. In fact, our message is that we belong together in one way or another, and that the border between us is not some kind of impassable Great Wall of China, and that their lives can also benefit from mutual cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Evidently, we have never fixed the external borders of the European Union, which means that in theory the door is open. Obviously, it is not open to the entire world, but in this case we are talking only about specific cases, people and families interconnected by history. Borders shifted a great deal in the 20th century. There is a village on Slovakia’s border with Ukraine which is cut in half, because that is where the border was drawn by Stalin's infantry troops. With such a difficult historical heritage, it is crucial for this programme of the European Union to promote citizens’ interests effectively and deliver results.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, as mentioned earlier in this debate, Russia chose not to take part in the cooperation in the context of the European neighbourhood policy, presumably because it feels that it was not treated in a sufficiently respectful manner. Instead, we have developed this strategic partnership, which unfortunately is not working in quite the way that it ought to. Mr Füle mentioned earlier that he did not intend to cut back on the Baltic Sea Programme, and I assume that this is a direct consequence of our failure to get projects with Russia off the ground. This is extremely worrying.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Cooperating with Russia is not easy – coming from Finland I am well aware of that. It is possible, however, if we approach Russia in the right way, in other words with respect, and if we realise that Russian culture is a little different from ours. I would venture to suggest that there is scope for improvement in the Commission’s knowledge of and attitude towards Russia. It is absolutely essential that we get cooperation with Russia off the ground. We only need to look at the Baltic Sea Strategy, where the position adopted by Russia is absolutely crucial in various ways. I look forward to some good initiatives from the Commission in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Until now, the Eastern Partnership has been the first and only foreign-policy initiative from my country, Poland, which has been accepted by Brussels and the whole European Community. Its real political sense lies in attracting six post-Soviet states to the Union. In documents establishing the programme this is not mentioned, but it is well known that that is what it is about.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The plan has come at the right time. Two crises, first of all the Georgian crisis, then the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine, clearly showed the EU leaders that it was worth taking an interest in that part of Europe to the east of the Union. In December, the Commission allocated EUR 600 million for that aim. Today, however, enthusiasm is waning and even in this Chamber there are questions being asked regarding the point of the Eastern Partnership. The German Socialist representative has stated that since the Germans are providing billions of euros for Greece, it makes no sense to have a programme of support for the post-Soviet states. This is as if we were to ask whether we should put on shoes or socks. It is a false alternative - we need both.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe is not only a business, an exchange of capital or inter-sectoral flows. It also stands for a love of freedom. Europe owes the post-Soviet countries, which remained behind the Iron Curtain for 50 years, a path forward to freedom and civilisation, and the development of the Eastern Partnership programme should achieve this. Therefore, seeing that difficulties and concrete doubts are emerging concerning a lack of procedural flexibility and problems implementing specific projects, we should seriously consider a revision of the instrument, so that the beautiful words written on paper will be reflected in real action, because it really is worth taking such action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Thank you for your generosity, Mr President. Someone once said that borders are wounds that have been created by history. Nevertheless, borders are necessary. Everything has limits, and naturally the European Union must have limits, too. I was a leading advocate of enlargement, and I still am. South-Eastern Europe must be integrated into the European Union as quickly as possible. However, we must at some point put an end to this. We must shape the borders that are necessary in as tolerable and constructive a way as possible. Borders must not be abrupt and they must not divide people. They can instead connect people if they are structured in a graduated and sensible way. That is the task of neighbourhood policy, as I understand it, both in the Mediterranean and to the east.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I am very pleased that, since the Prague summit – which was one success of the Czech Presidency, which was otherwise very turbulent – a real distinction has been made between the policy relating to the Mediterranean and that relating to our eastern neighbours. This is an old request that we here in Parliament, and I, too, have repeatedly made. We believe that this is a step in the right direction, as different issues need to be dealt with in different ways.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, these three different forms of cooperation – cooperation with Russia, preferential cooperation with our eastern neighbours and special cooperation in the Mediterranean region – should be treated as separate instruments with one and the same objective. If the question were to be raised as to who should take care of these instruments, the answer is that the Commission and Parliament should take care of them, in other words the real Community institutions, and in particular Commissioner Füle, who, in my opinion, does an excellent job in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the former rapporteur for the ENP in the last Parliament, I would say to Commissioner Füle that I remain sceptical as to whether one can really combine Morocco and Moldova under one policy umbrella. To an extent, the Eastern Partnership developments and the Euromed/Barcelona Process reflect my concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, I still hope that one day Ukraine, Moldova and a democratic Belarus might join the European Union. Nevertheless, I do agree that more cross-border ENPI funding needs to made affordable to solve questions such as the frozen conflicts from Transnistria to Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a region that particularly concerns me and which has never had any funding from the Commission. There is a real risk at the moment of an escalation of tensions, or even of hostilities breaking out again between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, particularly as Azerbaijan is now flush with petrodollars.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the southern dimension, solving the Western Sahara question and fighting religious fundamentalism, particularly in secular countries like Egypt and Tunisia, could also be an area where cross-border cooperation could become a priority. Sadly, for most of the countries of the European neighbourhood policy, it is all about bilateral EU relations with Brussels, with little or no interest really in regional integration amongst themselves or in cross-border cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Good neighbourly relations form the basis of the decent coexistence of nations. Financial resources invested in improving relations between nations and neighbouring states result in improved co-existence, calm and peace in the regions, and – when put to good use - economic growth as well, stimulated by greater trust in neighbourly relations and greater cooperation on common projects.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The forms of support for cross-border cooperation or the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument must be flexible, in order to reflect European policy for the given area or region. It is important from the perspective of application to simplify as far as possible the process of preparing and implementing individual projects, and for us to be able to evaluate operationally the actual benefits from the use of the resources expended at any stage. We certainly cannot force onto a universal template a wide range of different projects from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean, so the system must be capable of a certain openness to the specific needs of concrete forms of cooperation in a given region.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Following the correct evaluation of experience to date, let us not be afraid, therefore, of also going on to modernise or improve existing mechanisms. We will all support you in this matter, Commissioner.</p>

Funding for this programme is provided by the EU via the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Three projects submitted by Chişinău Municipal Council involving public lighting, the use of renewable energy resources and eco-remediation have passed the first stage in the selection process only after a year, which highlights a problem with excessive red tape.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although progress has been made, additional measures need to be taken. I think what is required is to simplify the procedures for accessing European funds, extend the areas where the cross-border cooperation programme is applicable and restrict the time limits for considering projects.

Historically, the strong Russian influences in Ukraine are of course obvious, but noting such a development I wonder – and this is also my question to you – to what extent the European neighbourhood policy is perhaps running up against a major problem in the form of this reinforcement of Russian influence in Kiev and Ukraine.

      <p sl="ro">Cross-border cooperation is one of the most important means of creating a united, extended Europe, without any division lines. An important role is also played in this by the Joint Operational Programme, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the 2007-2012 Cross-Border Cooperation Programme Romania-Ukraine-Moldova, which has more than EUR 126 million available.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As an EU Member State, Romania is helping to implement this programme in collaboration with two countries in the Eastern Partnership. This allows funding to be provided for concrete measures aimed at achieving the objectives of the European neighbourhood policy. The implementation of the programme, which is still a very difficult process, is facilitated by the entry into force this year of the local border traffic agreement between Romania and the Republic of Moldova. The same facilities could be established via a similar agreement between Romania and Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, the progress made in managing the eastern border is helping Romania prepare for its imminent accession to the Schengen area. Last but not least, the Danube Strategy currently being drafted by the EU may give new impetus to cross-border cooperation with the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.

I will not touch on procedural changes and why it is vital to simplify them, as at least three previous speakers have already spoken on the issue. However, taking into consideration the fact that a significant factor for the correct exploitation of European resources is the creation of an appropriate administrative capability, at a regional as well as at a local level, I would like to ask how the Commission is planning to support cooperation of regional and local independent governing bodies in the European Union with their partners within the framework of the European Instrument, and particularly with Eastern Partnership countries.</p>

Last week, when Mr Yanukovych was in Brussels, the considerable concern that we really ought to express with regard to developments there was not, at any rate, reflected in the public statements as far as I could see.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, this is not the first time I have addressed you, but for the first time I have received many questions which actually go beyond the framework of the original question. I welcome that and hope that I will be able to explain.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming back to the original questions with which we started our discussions, I absolutely agree with those who consider cross-border cooperation to be a way of melting down borders as much as possible, particularly when we are talking people-to-people contacts. The time of the walls belongs to the past and the cross-border cooperation programmes make a significant contribution to that fact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with the timing of various steps. I already mentioned in my statement that the Commission is now in the process of undertaking a mid-term review of CBC; that will be ready in December 2010. As regards the ENPI Regulation, that was reviewed in its mid-term review in 2009. All the financial allocations will, then, be clarified by the end of this year and we will table legislative proposals on the so-called ENPI II by the end of next year, though that is already looking into the future, beyond 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue related to this – and this is where we are, concerning the funds and Russia – I can say that everything is on time, taking into account the difficulties I have mentioned. Everything is on time concerning the EU funds. There are some small delays in adding the Russian money due to some technical issues on their side, but that should be clarified soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Brok is absolutely right concerning how EU regional policy and territorial cooperation on EU external borders should be combined; I could not have put it better myself. Our instruments aim at making this cooperation as easy as possible, bringing together regions in the EU Member States and in our partner countries. Here I strongly believe that our discussion today should not be seen in isolation but as, hopefully, creating a momentum for closer interaction with many of you. I have heard from many representatives with wide experience in this area, so I shall be ready to use all the communications channels we have at our disposal – while also being creative to add some other informal channels – so as to make as much use as possible of that experience, because it is important that we pass the reality check on this particular issue of CBC.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is important that we also pass a reality check on neighbourhood policy, and I welcome the fact that a number of you raised this issue. You know that in conjunction with the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, we have indeed initiated a review process of our neighbourhood policy. The last neighbourhood package, which we presented in the spring, assessed not just last year’s achievements but the achievements of all five years.</p>
      <p sl="en">With Cathy Ashton, we thought this to be an excellent basis from which to consider a number of questions: Is our policy right? Are we going in the right directions? Do our partners feel they have ownership of this policy? Have we got our instruments right? Do we have the necessary resources? And including the questions: Are we still talking about neighbourhood policy in terms of instruments and defining the goal of neighbourhood policy as ensuring peace, stability and prosperity on the borders of the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="en">Should we not also be starting, at least, to discuss the questions: Is there an end game for this policy? Is there a goal we could define? Is there something which would make it more attractive for our partners to work and cooperate with us? These are the questions we have started to address with the Member States, with our partner countries, think-tanks and civil society organisations, but also, of course, with you. We are now working with the Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to find suitable dates and times. Once again, on this particular issue I am looking to be creative about informal contacts with you, because this is a very important issue and I hope very much that by presenting a new neighbourhood package in the spring of next year we will be ready to share with our partners and the rest of the world the results of this review policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The review policy will not focus solely on the three pillars as we know them today: political association, economic integration and the mobility issue. We will also focus most definitely on how our values are to be reflected in this new policy, on how we can make our argument about human rights and fundamental freedoms stronger – not only in certain parts of our neighbourhood but across the board. In addition, we have some concrete issues to discuss with countries such as Ukraine and Tunisia, and with some others. But this is engagement, which will bring us to the negotiating table, and it is our assistance and our insistence on these roles which will help those countries reach a suitable level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to a specific question on Russia and Ukraine from the honourable Member Mr Belder, I just would like to add that I hope very much that our cooperation with partners, and specifically with Ukraine, will not be based on competition with any third country and that there will not be a zero-sum game approach but a win-win situation improving the situation in the region as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sure that I have not been able to address all your questions but I will look at them in the course of the CBC policy review, and I will also find a way to answer them in writing because I feel they are important and that we should address them again in the framework of this review process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give one more specific answer, concerning the idea of moving these programmes from DG RELEX to DG REGIO. I do not think that this will solve the challenges I mentioned at the beginning. On the contrary, it would mean the foreign policy issue – which does exist – would be ignored, and I am sure that we have a lot of will within the current framework to find a way of making the programmes work better.</p>
      <p sl="en">So now, let me thank you very much for the discussion on this particular issue. Thank you very much for a number of good ideas which we will also tackle with you when we go through this neighbourhood policy review process.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Cross-border cooperation is essential for our neighbouring countries. How is it possible to have a prosperous and sustainable economy if the borders are closed? It provides better border security and intelligent management of migratory flows. However, some of our neighbouring regions, such as the Maghreb, do not know how to work together. In the majority of cases where cross-border cooperation among our neighbours is at a standstill there is an unfinished conflict with a long history behind it. It is obviously crucial that we give our neighbours the resources to cooperate. However, in order for the budgets allocated to be really useful, we need the European Union, in other words, you, Mr Füle, and especially Baroness Ashton, to be present on the political stage. It needs to be in a position to have an influence, be heard and be respected. Otherwise the Union for the Mediterranean is doomed to failure. In addition, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument creates a multitude of documents and suffers as a result of its complexity or even opacity. Parliament has almost no right to see the strategy documents and national indicative programmes. We must be consulted more often and be better informed, and the procedure must be simplified.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, the issue raised in this question is indeed one that concerns fundamental human rights, which are core values of the European Union and which are also central to the Union’s external action.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you of the Commission’s fundamental attachment to human rights, as well as to the core Conventions of the International Labour Organisation, including the one on forced labour. At the same time, you are also aware of how delicate an issue this is in our relations with China.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament that the laogai system is completely incompatible with universally-accepted concepts of human rights, as well as China’s ambitions to become a modern and developed society. The maintenance of this system is also wholly incompatible with China’s stated commitment to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it signed twelve years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is indeed faced with the problem that goods produced in laogai, under those very conditions which we condemned, may well be imported into the European Union. However, it is extremely difficult to accurately establish whether – and which – goods imported from China into the European Union have been produced in laogai.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to previous queries by the European Parliament – as well as civil society organisations – the European Union has consistently raised the matter with China in recent years, particularly in the context of the bi-annual Human Rights Dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the European Union has underlined that the laogai system violates several articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and in particular Article 8, which prohibits forced or compulsory labour, and Article 9, which states that no one should be imprisoned without a proper trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">To date, the European Union has preferred to use an approach of positive engagement with China, rather than making use of an import ban. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to this approach which, so far, has not produced any notable change in Chinese policy as regards Laogai.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to recognise that China is not the only country where the issue of prison labour is a matter of concern. The Commission is therefore open to revisiting the question of the most effective way to apply pressure on countries that make use of prison labour, in violation of fundamental human rights principles and of the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation. However, this will have to be done in a horizontal way and should not be limited to China only.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would welcome Parliament’s further views on this issue and will keep you informed on further developments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is fortuitous that we are holding this debate in the same part-session as the deliberations regarding the forthcoming EU-China summit. The issue of laogai camps has repercussions for both trade policy and human rights policy. I would like to focus on the human rights aspects here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prisoners in China’s laogai prisons are forced into slave labour under the cynical motto ‘Reform through labour’. This huge network of enforced labour camps violates fundamental human rights. Prison conditions are appalling and are unacceptable to China’s European partners. They flagrantly flout universal human rights, which the People’s Republic of China undertook to observe no later than 12 years ago when it ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament has already condemned the laogai system several times in the past. However, there is something that we must note: laogai prisons bear the names of commercial enterprises just like normal businesses, seeking to conceal the true nature of their products, which are produced by enforced labour. The US has placed a legal ban on the import of prison-produced goods and has kept its market closed to these so-called ‘businesses’. We have not yet introduced such a ban. Commissioner, you have stated that it is difficult to determine where products originate. We know the names of these businesses, which are in fact prisons. The US already has specific experience in relation to how these products can be kept off the market. The question is whether you are prepared to take notice of these company lists and to enter into specific discussions with the US on how something can be achieved in this way?</p>
      <p sl="de">Will the European Union now insist that China should move swiftly to permit the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit the prisons of his choice, particularly in Xinjiang and Tibet?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to preface my remarks by saying that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is very interested in constructive relations with the People’s Republic of China. Your response today disappointed me a little, however, because it contained nothing concrete. In fact, all you have done is to draw attention to the current situation, trying to hide behind the fact that this is a difficult matter. This is not an acceptable excuse, when other countries, such as the US as we have just heard, have already managed to find very clear solutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">A positive trade balance with China – which is something I would welcome for us all – cannot excuse us for turning a blind eye to serious violations of human rights. I am sure that China and its representatives are working hard to deal with the very difficult situation in China – a boom and growth in the economy on the coast and in the major cities and increasing poverty in the rural areas – leading to an absolute imbalance in the country’s social structures. However, this cannot excuse us from making every effort to prevent the import of these goods to Europe, whether intentionally or unintentionally. We have a wide range of measures open to us; we can make sure that businesses in Europe are made aware of the problematic products. The names of these cover companies who deal in goods from laogai camps are known. We also know who the suppliers are. It is not much use for us in Europe to have most of our companies providing an excellent example by making an undertaking that human rights are respected, if we do nothing to help them keep to this undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also see myself as a representative of the consumer, who wants to be sure when buying products of Chinese origin that these products are not the result of enforced labour. We already have a heightened awareness in relation to products that result from child labour. A lot has been done in this regard. I expect the Commission to come up with some specific proposals, such as quality marks. I want to see a ban on products that can be proven to come from these sources and I also want to see continued constructive and effective dialogue with China. I believe that there is a willingness on the part of the Chinese government to continue with this dialogue. China is also interested in improving its human rights record. Let us try to achieve this through dialogue, but we should not turn a blind eye to human rights violations simply because trade relationships are so important.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there are more than a thousand camps, according to the estimates of the NGOs, 3 to 5 million people imprisoned, almost all of whom are accused of endangering the security of the State, and allegations of organ trafficking. Even if this list is not exhaustive, it is nonetheless very concerning. The forced labour camps in China are a real disgrace.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The reaction of the international community is nevertheless still quite a timid one. What we actually expect from the European Union is to tell us that it is taking measured steps, of course, but steps that are nevertheless capable of leading all of China’s trading partners to show a united front in order to obtain real concessions from it. Task forces have already been created for challenges of lesser importance.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Commissioner, I would also like to join those who have said that your speech was rather disappointing, as this issue should be a key issue for us. There are approximately 7 million people in these camps. These people are very often subject to repression due to their religious or political views. Our moral and political responsibility should be to counteract this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It really is difficult to avoid the feeling that this prison system recalls the Soviet gulags, and its name even brings vividly to mind the famous inscription over the German Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, ‘Arbeit macht frei’, as ‘laogai’ means ‘improvement through work’. Therefore we cannot just ignore this, and this issue should be absolutely key in any discussions between the European Union and China, and also, as I understand it, in any Member State discussions with China. This is a key issue and I would call on the Commissioner to place this issue on the agenda at every meeting with the Chinese authorities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we all know what the democracy and human rights situation is in China. We have just been talking about the European neighbourhood policy. These two matters have something in common: economic realism prevails.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the eyes of those who govern Europe, China is first and foremost a big market. We should not therefore upset the Chinese authorities as they could close their borders to us. It does not matter that there is still the same level of political repression. I for one have not forgotten the victims of Tiananmen Square. I have not forgotten all those who are rotting in prison, in labour camps or even paying with their lives for their fight for democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The laogai system is indeed a terrible symbol of what is happening in China. You told us once again that human rights were important to the Commission. So, Commissioner, do not hide behind technical considerations. Do not content yourself any longer with talking to the Chinese Government. You are well aware of how the Chinese Government receives your words. For them, discussions on this issue are something that they have to endure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your initial speech did very little to answer the questions put by my fellow Members. You did not actually say anything specific and do not hide behind the fact that there are labour camps in other countries. You tell us that China is modernising. I would say this: it depends for whom.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am not a pro-American, far from it. In this case, however, it seems to me that at the very least doing what the United States is doing would be a minimum. In the area of security and the so-called fight against terrorism we know how to cooperate with the United States, including to the detriment of Europeans. Why is the European Union not capable of doing the same thing when it comes to respecting human rights?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, when will the European Union ban exports of products from laogai camps?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, your words are certainly not what we expected as we were waiting for a stronger reaction on this issue. We cannot allow human rights to be subordinated to the economy, otherwise the existence of the European Union no longer makes sense.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are millions of people in the laogai, millions of people who see their human rights abused. Above all we must not forget that in any case this is also a problem for the European economy, because these products arriving on our market also create unfair competition which leads to economic crises in Europe, too, with loss of competitiveness and dumping as well. This makes it clear that despite what the Chinese Government has said and done over the years, unfortunately the results are nowhere to be seen.</p>
      <p sl="it">The laogai continue to exist and unfortunately millions and millions of people, who represent minorities in these countries, see their rights trampled underfoot. We believe, and I hope, that diplomatic efforts and concertation will now give way to a strong reaction from Europe which entails a determined fight against the import of products from the laogai, perhaps following the example of the United States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are all aware that the laogai network is the front for an intolerable system of enforced labour camps in China. The very existence of these labour camps is intolerable, but I find it repellent that many of the products manufactured there find their way into our shops. These labour camps are not just used as part of the penal system for prisoners, but also enable the Chinese Government to reap profits and economic benefits. This again is an intolerable situation. How can we know that some of the products from these labour camps will not be served as part of the hospitality offered to the delegation from the European Union that is to visit China in 14 days’ time? I do not think I would be able to stomach this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Füle, I am very disappointed by what you have had to say. Instead of finally focusing on this issue and presenting us with solutions, you have announced that the Commission first intends to find out what other countries also use critical prisons to manufacture products that reach our markets. You should deal with one problem appropriately. When you have solved this problem, then we can move on to another one. We should avoid spreading ourselves too thinly, but should finally tackle this problem head-on.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am calling on the Commission and the Council finally to ensure that the products from these camps will no longer be sold in a single European shop. We do not want products like this in Europe. As has already been mentioned several times, our friends in the US have found a way to ban these products from their shops. I call on the Commission to ensure that these bloodstained products no longer reach our markets. I am in favour of good partnership with China, but these camps and other issues will always be a thorn in the side of our relations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated that human rights are core values in the European Union. Last December, we proudly signed off on the Treaty of Lisbon and the legally binding Convention on Human Rights associated with it. What you have said is absolutely correct and of vital importance: we must defend these human rights at every turn and we must also allow these principles to guide our trade activities.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you have pointed out, this is a difficult matter. However, as has already been stated, a list of camps producing laogai products already exists. I have a book here with all the relevant information. It shows which prison manufactures which products and under which trade name. Hence, it is possible to research this issue. That is why, for example, the Laogai Research Foundation, which is active both internationally and within Europe – I say this for the benefit of President Müller, who is with us here today – has written to Commissioner De Gucht to ask him to enable the UN Special Envoy to visit the camps of his choice and to examine the question of whether it is possible to halt tariff preferences for such products on a temporary basis, following the example of the US, which is somewhat more courageous on this issue than we are. I would like to know what progress has been made with the Commission’s promised investigation into this issue?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add a few figures to those cited by my fellow Members: there are more than 1 000 certified laogai camps, between 40 and 50 million prisoners have spent time in the laogai since 1949 and in particular there are 314 commercial companies linked to the laogai.</p>
      <p sl="it">The laogai represent one of the most repressive prison systems in the world, created on the model of the Soviet gulags to punish opponents of the communist regime; for political motives, in other words. The European Union already has enormous difficulty competing with the production system of the People’s Republic of China, whose trade union, environmental and consumer protection standards are absolutely non-existent. If we accept the import of goods produced by political prisoners we then become accomplices, at least morally, to these crimes which we ought to be helping to eradicate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Otherwise, Commissioner, we will confirm the impression that we are very critical towards small countries and very cautious in our dealings with large countries such as China. To conclude: the forthcoming October summit is an opportunity to deal with this problem as well. Commissioner, I hope that this opportunity is not missed and that you will return with more favourable news.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As you are aware, Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates the right to a fair trial. Obviously, laogai, which is re-education through labour, blatantly violates this right. As my fellow Members before me have stated, laogai camps do more than this. They subject prisoners to torture and degrading treatment, as well as to doing jobs, unpaid of course, in mines, on farms and in factories, which sometimes last the whole day. In laogai camps as well, according to investigations carried out by organisations for the protection of human rights, detainees are subjected to beatings, acts of sexual aggression, while also being deprived of medical care and an acceptable diet. The import of any such goods created in the laogai system into the EU must obviously be banned. I strongly believe this should happen. The Commission can monitor this ban. Mr Gallagher very clearly made this suggestion in his speech.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I too believe, as other fellow Members have also said, that every opportunity must be taken by EU representatives in high-level meetings with Chinese officials to request an outright ban on this degrading system.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who worship the god of money do not care if that money has blood on it. The Chinese Government uses the manpower of these people under inhumane working conditions and continues to export goods with blood on them to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not think that the moral issue will help the European Union resolve the problem because the European Union still does not have any measures in place to stop the import of such goods, and it continues its dealings with the People’s Republic of China despite being aware of what China is doing and of the origin of these goods.</p>
      <p sl="it">I fear that the moral issue does not interest Europe enough, so Parliament is issuing a firm invitation to come back with greater determination, to tackle this problem unequivocally with China and in the meantime, since Europe has its own economic worries, we should at least move towards a regulation for naming the place of origin as soon as possible. In this way, it will be possible to tell the Chinese Government that if the manufacture and export of goods made by prisoners is not forbidden, then for us everything Chinese will be an instrument likely to be born from blood.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, we should not forget that a substantial part of China’s economic rise is due to the prison economy. The laogai system has been the most important tool of massive political oppression and has included since 1949 about 50 million inmates. Even today there are up to five million detainees. Most of them have been kept there under the guise of preventing a threat to state security. The large-scale exploitation of slave labour in Communist China’s prison camps has become an open secret. It has been proved that most laogai prisons operate under the titles of commercial companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the eve of the EU-China summit, Commissioner, are you prepared to implement President Van Rompuy’s principle of reciprocity in further actions? I agree that you did not answer most of our questions. For example, is there any cooperation with US authorities on detecting laogai products? Have you taken a look at Parliament’s previous resolutions which have advocated a ban on sales of laogai products in Europe and have insisted that further progress on cooperation with China should depend on Beijing ratifying important UN and ILO Conventions? Also, are you prepared to suspend China’s status under the generalised system of preferences if the Chinese authorities refuse? These are questions to which we need answers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, incarcerating people in labour camps because they do not share the same views as a governing regime is a crime against human dignity. Slave labour camps, re-education camps and internment camps – these are all anachronisms that have lost none of their repugnance in the 21st century, wherever in the world they may be. I am truly disappointed that the European Commission, against our better judgment, has failed to present any concrete measures to the Members of this House to deal with the Chinese case and has not explained how it envisages future cooperation between the EU and China.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the US has lists of businesses and if books exist publishing the names of businesses that are known to be a front for internment camps, then why is it that you do not have them? Why are you taking this blinkered approach? You and the Commission are making yourselves share in the blame for the misery suffered by those who have been imprisoned, mostly without due legal process. No one could want this. The rule of law is one of our fundamental principles in Europe and in the European Union. As an MEP, I am ashamed to have had to listen to what was said here today.

      <p sl="de">Thank you very much Mr President. Commissioner, you said: in the context of relations with China, this is a very delicate subject. That is clear. In my opinion, however, partners who do business together and who establish a partnership on a global level, must not only hammer home their own values in negotiations, but also draw the appropriate conclusions. Otherwise, as I think we all will agree, one of the negotiating partners could be accused of hypocrisy when it criticises the fact that these condemnable camps exist, while at the same time willingly allowing these products into its market. It is an issue for European credibility that we should not just talk the talk, but also walk the walk. I believe that this position would be met with respect in China, rather than being rejected.

It is a fact, of course, that China does execute thousands of its citizens yearly for various reasons: from major capital crimes – something we might find understandable – to economic sabotage and even pimping.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is another issue which I raised in the past with Commissioner Mandelson, which is the worry that forced labour camps may be producing goods. This is an allegation. One particular thing cited was rubber boots, which somehow find their way onto the EU markets. I have some sympathy with the Commission because identifying this, or proving it, has so far been impossible.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Laogai camps, named after the Chinese words ‘lao’ – meaning ‘re-education’ - and ‘gai’ – meaning ‘labour’ – began to be established in China shortly after the communist takeover in 1948.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Almost 50 million Chinese have been imprisoned in the camps since their inception, and only half of these ever returned home. According to the Laogai research institute in Washington, there are presently more than 1 700 such camps in China. Between 3 and 5 million people are being held in them. People are mostly sent to the camps without any judicial procedure, as a police decision is enough. In the camps, the Chinese regime deliberately strips the prisoners of their human dignity and individuality, and forces their relatives and friends to write letters in which they spurn and abandon the prisoners. These letters eventually break the prisoner, along with the inhumanely long interrogations, torture and 14 hours of hard labour every day. The prisoners have just 3 – 4 days off per year. There is no medical care or medicines in the camps. The prisoners who work outside supplement their poor diet by eating grass. The camps do not provide any privacy, and 5 – 15% of prisoners commit suicide in the camps.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should therefore take effective measures to ensure that products from these slave factories do not soil the conscience of European civilisation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the prospect of being jailed for thought crimes is shocking. Unlike most of the people here, I can tell you that from personal experience. The British Government has tried to jail me three times under anti-free-speech laws that state that telling the truth is no defence. So I am very sympathetic to Chinese, and especially Tibetan, dissidents forced into slave labour in Communist prison camps.</p>
      <p sl="en">Steps must be taken to prevent the goods they make being allowed to undercut manufacturing and workers in the West. But, if one accepts that items made by forced labour constitute unfair competition, it is impossible to avoid the same conclusion about goods made by sweated labour, by workers who are not allowed to organise into trade unions in a country where there are no environmental protection costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The truth is that all manufactured goods from China constitute unfair competition. Trade with China, far from being free, costs millions of jobs and destroys our manufacturing base. It is time to protect our workers from this unholy alliance of Communist tyranny and capitalist greed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, whether or not it should be permissible to sell goods which prisoners have been compelled to make must depend on whether the prisoners have committed real offences, as distinct from political ones – of course in China we know exactly what the offences are – on whether the judicial system is fair and, certainly, on whether prisoners are being kept in humane conditions, which they are certainly not in the laogai.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, whether or not other people should be permitted to buy them must depend on whether or not the importing country wishes to close down its own factories and put its own workers out of employment. That should apply not only to goods made by prisoners but to goods from any low-wage economy with which our workers cannot expect to compete.</p>
      <p sl="en">Advocates of free trade in the classical economics books always say that free trade makes the world as a whole much richer. However, that does not mean that each country becomes richer. It certainly does not mean that British and other European workers who are thrown out of work will become richer. Their interests must come first.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, China’s economic development is unparalleled in modern economic history, and it is playing an increasingly important role on the world scene. This role also entails responsibilities, such as respect for fundamental rights and core labour rights. It is crucial for the Chinese leadership to live up to these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even in these challenging times, China and Europe are natural partners. A policy of engagement and dialogue with China is the best way to move forward to resolve these issues, notably in the context of our Human Rights Dialogue or the EU-China High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">This being said, we must also stand up for our values and principles, including with regard to prison labour in the laogai. In the light of this, the Commission – as I mentioned in my introduction – is open to considering an effective way of preventing imports of goods made using prison labour and will further pursue this in close dialogue with the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">My colleague, Commissioner Karel De Gucht, made extensive reference to human rights in China in this House last Tuesday. I can reassure this House that human rights, including the European Union’s wish to see the laogai abolished, will be raised at the EU-China summit on 6 October.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unlike the United States, the EU does not have a horizontal instrument in place banning the import of goods produced using prison labour. The Commission is ready to study the effectiveness of the United States law in preventing such imports, given the difficulty in identifying them. I will not miss the opportunity to inform my four colleagues the work of whose respective DGs is related to this issue that, according to this House, the time has come to establish an inter-DG taskforce to look into this matter more deeply.</p>
