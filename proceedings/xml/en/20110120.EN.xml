      <p sl="en">Mr President, these days, competition is often regarded as a concept that makes life difficult. Some people prefer cosy arrangements and the hot tub of backstage agreements as protection against the harsh world of global competition. But, Commissioner, competition is not the spoiler but the lifesaver of the European economy. Europe is at a crossroads. Will it create a transfer economy, with low growth and high structural unemployment, or will it have a wealth-creating economy that stands the test of global competition?</p>
      <p sl="en">A football team, Commissioner, that is not competitive loses game after game. An economy that is not competitive loses investment, jobs and finally, the basis of its social arrangements. Since European competition policy is the exclusive competence of the European Commission, you, Commissioner – or rather Commissioner Almunia, for whom you are standing in – play a decisive role.</p>
      <p sl="en">This week, the United Nations published figures on foreign direct investment in 2010. The United States attracted 43% more foreign investment than in 2009. Foreign direct investment in Latin America rose by 21% and in Asia by 10%. In the European Union, it dropped by 20% – and why is that? The money goes to where the action is. Apparently, investors regard Europe as the continent of inaction, only generating poor growth figures. It demonstrates the European Union facing a competitiveness deficit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you have to assure a level playing field for entrepreneurial activity in Europe to make our continent fit for global competition. We all know China.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to draw your attention to several aspects of competition policy in 2009, of which many features are visible today. The main issue now is the consequences of massive State aid to the financial sector: states allocated taxpayers’ money to prevent the collapse of the financial sector. Had we allowed a meltdown of the financial sector, the savings and pensions of millions of European citizens would have been buried too. But it goes without saying that State aid on this scale created distortions of competition. That is why it has to end as soon as possible and the money has to be paid back to taxpayers in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, my first question therefore is: how temporary is the temporary framework, and how will it be phased out? I hope you will clarify this issue on behalf of Commissioner Almunia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another aspect is liquidity support of the European Central Bank to certain banks in order to keep them alive. I admit there is an interface between monetary and competition policy – but did its impact distort competition? That is my question.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue is the set of rules for divestment. Work criteria for downsizing companies are sufficiently clear and fair. Now we should look at the future: what is going to happen, Commissioner? Member States have gone very far to recapitalise the financial sector by partly and/or entirely nationalising institutions with taxpayers’ money. This will have to be unravelled. But once Member States start withdrawing from financial institutions to restore their private status, there is a danger that they will leave behind a dowry, a sort of wedding gift. Dowries may be used to prop up the position of financial institutions in the private market.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a feature we have often seen in the process of privatisation. I remember it too well in the postal sector. Governments propped up their postal provider just before entering the private market. In a letter, I reminded Commissioner Almunia of the long-lasting investigation into the German postal provider. The Commission is currently opening investigations into the British, French and Belgian postal providers as well, since these postal markets will be liberalised this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, Commissioner, I ask you to be attentive to the phenomenon of dowry in the financial sector. Preventing a problem is better than going the long way of legal redress.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank you, Commissioner – and also Commissioner Almunia – for your cooperation, and I also thank the service of DG Competition which, as I know, is one of the best in the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of Vice-President Almunia, who is unable to be here this morning, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his work on the report on Competition Policy 2009. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and the Committee on Transport, Ms Koch-Mehrin, Mr Buşoi and Mr Cramer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the positive tone of the report and the support expressed for our actions in the field of competition policy in 2009, in particular, in the context of the economic and financial crisis. We share your view that competition is essential to ensure a level playing field in the single market and to promote a sustainable exit from the crisis. This is why the Commission remains committed to enforcing its firm stance on anti-competitive behaviour and mergers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission takes note of the many requests for specific reports or studies – more than 10 of them. It is not feasible for the Commission to produce all these reports, due to our priorities and limited resources. However, as Vice-President Almunia announced to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in November, the Commission will analyse the effects on competition of the temporary State aid measures taken in the context of the crisis. This work will be difficult, but the crisis is a learning opportunity we simply cannot miss.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to restate here that these measures are indeed temporary. The Commission prolonged the crisis framework for State aid until the end of 2011 because the economic conditions are still uncertain. However, the gradual phasing out of these measures has already started. Some measures have been terminated and others have been maintained under stricter conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, as regards private enforcement of competition rules, the Commission takes note of Parliament’s support for the creation of a European form of collective redress, and of its request for specific EU legislation to ensure compensation for victims of infringements of EU antitrust law. The Commission will launch a public consultation at the beginning of 2011 on a European approach to collective redress. It then plans to adopt a communication based on the results of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to refer to the concerns expressed about competition in specific sectors, such as energy, transport, the food supply chain and emerging digital industries. The Commission shares your concerns, and we will maintain our strong enforcement activities in these fields in close cooperation with the national competition authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, competition policy is one of the most important, central policy areas of the EU. Good competition policy enables markets to function properly. Good competition policy also allows consumers to benefit from a wide variety of products at reasonable and affordable prices. Good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in Europe. That is why it is so important, Commissioner, to include all the areas that you have mentioned in competition policy. It is also important to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the driving force behind growth in Europe. Market barriers must be abolished, which also means doing away with the excessive costs that still pertain where competition is not working, such as roaming charges on mobile phones, where competition still does not exist – something that needs to be changed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his excellent work, and to the Commission I would say: be ambitious in your goals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on its flexibility in applying the competition rules during the current financial and economic crisis. It is very important that the crisis is not used as a pretext to eliminate competition, and the Commission has already shown a very firm attitude against cartels, which is a good thing. We need to make sure that there are exit mechanisms and that we come back to normal market conditions as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some areas – and you spoke about that, Commissioner – where competition can be enhanced. These include the energy market, where regulated energy prices still distort competition; the completion of the single railway market can also bring important benefits to European travellers. The Commission should also be particularly careful concerning competition on the medicines market, especially with regard to those practices of originator producers which restrict the entry of generic medicines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, I call on the Commission to be firm in securing competition between public and private hospitals by means of bold action against cross-subsidies which favour public hospitals. The Commission needs to communicate the benefits of competition policy to consumers more effectively.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012-000" speaker_id="28238" name="Michael CRAMER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism" nationality="Germany" birth_date="16-06-1949" birth_place="Gevelsberg" p_group="Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Transport is also a decisive issue when it comes to competition. After all, transport is responsible for 30% of CO2 emissions, which is why I am pleased to see that it has been accepted that transport should be included in the central demands of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we still have unfair competition and this is where the Commission needs to take action. For example, the aviation sector, which is the climate killer par excellence , enjoys an exemption from value added tax and duty on fuel. This means that the European taxpayers pay out EUR 30 billion every year for aviation, simply so that the airlines can offer intercity flights at the same price as a short taxi journey. The railways are required to bear the burden here. We have a mandatory rail toll for every locomotive for every kilometre travelled. This is a mandatory levy and has no upper limit. On the roads, it is left up to the Member States to decide whether they charge any tolls at all. The tolls mostly apply only on motorways and only to heavy goods vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more. In other words, some of our Member States levy a high rail toll but no road tolls at all. We cannot allow this because it completely misses the point. After all, if we do not change mobility habits, we will never succeed in averting climate change. Yet this is something we have to achieve. That is why you must establish fair competition in the transport sector too.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Commissioner, we are all lazy. If we can get away with not doing something, most people will indeed not do it. Business is no exception in this respect. The majority of entrepreneurs (I am convinced of this) dream of the possibility of being monopoly providers who can dictate terms, instead of having those terms dictated to them by consumers. Competition is exactly what ensures consumers receive not only low prices but also optimum quality. Unfortunately, in the European Union, we still have several sectors where there is no real competition. The first of these is energy. There are still isolated markets in several areas in Europe where there is no competition at all, for legally technical reasons. What is the result? Artificially high prices for consumers. A concrete example of this is the Baltic States and the gas market. As Commissioner Oettinger himself has admitted, consumers in Germany currently pay 30% less for natural gas than consumers in the Baltic States. Why is there competition on one side, but none in the Baltic States? This must change. There is a second sphere where there is no real competition, and that is the agriculture sector. Without even mentioning what effect subsidies as such have in the agriculture market, we have within Europe very unequal agricultural payments or subsidies in one Member State compared to another. What does this mean? It means that European consumers pay artificially high prices in many places and, of course, farmers also suffer. Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to support this report, which concerns the Commission’s work on ‘Towards competition’ in 2009. I shall remind you, however, that this work does not end with this, and that we have to extend the spheres where competition needs to be present. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the 2009 report on competition policy is probably one of the most extensive and comprehensive reports drafted by Parliament to date – the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has succeeded in incorporating the opinion of three other parliamentary committees – and it was produced after a period of five years following the implementation of two significant regulations, the Modernisation Regulation and the Merger Regulation, which have played a positive role in competition policy. However, the implementation of the regulations could be improved if the priorities were better aligned, the cooperation efforts redoubled, the administrative burden alleviated and if there was convergence between national and EU laws.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report includes the importance of public services in meeting the basic needs of citizens and we feel we need to emphasise this within the new framework established by the Treaty of Lisbon. Therefore, and taking into account the importance of the information society, support is being given to the aid aimed at offering suitable universal broadband coverage at affordable prices to our citizens, and we request that attention is paid to the development of roaming prices in the telecommunications field in subsequent reports.</p>
      <p sl="es">Competition policy is key in financial services. The aid offered has contributed to stabilising and mitigating the effects of the economic crisis. The report highlights its provisional nature and that its extension must take place under stricter conditions and a level playing field must be re-established for the exit process in order to avoid any moral risks and, above all, so that the financial institutions that have not claimed State aid see their competitive position restored.</p>
      <p sl="es">Three points are also emphasised in the financial arena: the transparency of financial information, the need for the European payment system to be accessible, transparent and to function in a non-discriminatory and efficient manner and, thirdly, the need to combat unusually high prices in cross-border transactions with payment cards. The report also raises concerns about small and medium-sized businesses and energy, and takes on board the recommendations of the High-Level Group for the dairy sector – which holds the view that strengthening the negotiating power of the producers and the new contractual relationships must be compatible with competition policy – and asks the Commission for a legislative initiative to facilitate individual or collective claims for compensation for damages caused by infringements of competition law, whilst avoiding the excesses of the US system.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, on his excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur. We have worked in tandem (me being last year’s rapporteur), and that brings me to my first point.</p>
      <p sl="de">It strikes me about these annual debates on competition policy that there is a very friendly and polite exchange of views, and then the Commission just carries on with business as usual because the Commission has the exclusive powers in this area. I think, at a time where we are discussing economic governance for the European Union, that should change. The European Parliament should have a much bigger role in shaping competition policies, and I therefore urge the Commission to follow, in particular, recommendations 3 and 4, and really seriously report back to the European Parliament about its recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, in my view, a report should be more than a mere summary of actions taken. It should be an analysis of the impact of the competition policies, and that is currently lacking. You say that you will do one on the temporary State aid framework because that is your priority, but we have been calling for such analyses for years: on green recovery, on State aid to innovation, on State aid to public services. That is long overdue, so I would ask the Commission to do more in-depth analysis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would urgently reiterate the calls we have been making – for years now – for a sector inquiry into online advertising and search engines. This is really long overdue, and I would like to hear from the Commission when they intend to conduct such an inquiry.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016-000" speaker_id="96648" name="Philippe LAMBERTS" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group" nationality="Belgium" birth_date="14-03-1963" birth_place="Bruxelles" m_state="BE">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Commissioner Almunia, who is not here today but who, even though it is not the European Parliament’s domain, spends a considerable amount of time with us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and is therefore investing time in an ongoing dialogue with Parliament on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to thank the rapporteur. We often do this formally but, Mr Eppink, although our parties often disagree on many things, I must say that while drawing up this report, there were no taboo matters in our discussion. All points were fully addressed in a very constructive spirit, and this should be highlighted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would now like to move on to three points with which I believe the Commission should move forward. One, as was pointed out, is the importance of the financial sector, which, in truth, is given too much weight in the economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know the financial crisis has meant that the financial groups that came through did so bigger and stronger. So there really is a problem of market distortion in that area, and this does not only relate to special State aid measures established by Member States to help their financial sector, but also, and we emphasised this in the report, various forms of direct aid from the European Central Bank (ECB) that are, I am sorry to say, not very transparent at all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore urge the Commission to focus on the way in which the ECB has helped the banks, because it is clear that the banks that went to the ECB to seek help benefited from a kind of aid that those that were better managed did not request. Banks that were properly managed, therefore, have somehow been victims of a market distortion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second sector is that of raw materials, particularly food commodities. We know that large agro-industrial businesses and major retailers have a market position that gives them far too strong an influence over price formation. A market survey on this issue is absolutely vital.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another point, and not the least important, is tax competition. You know that most Member States, including my own and many others, practise forms of tax competition that are very harmful to the general European interest. These forms of competition must be stopped. I know that the Commission is beginning to take an interest in this issue once again, but I strongly urge Commissioner Almunia and Commissioner Šemeta to tackle this problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moving on to my last point, we were pleased to note that Commissioner Almunia has already imposed fines in various sectors since the beginning of his term of office, particularly in the air freight sector. We also welcome the opening of the investigation into Google, which I think partially answers the point Mrs in ’t Veld made a moment ago.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, answering that kind of question in 30 seconds is clearly an almost impossible task.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is the issue here? The European Central Bank (ECB) agrees to provide liquidity to banks that request it, in an unlimited way, accepting all kinds of assets as collateral for that liquidity. However, we do not have a very clear idea of the nature of those assets. We also strongly suspect that many of them are, as they say, syphilitic or toxic assets whose real market value is very difficult to determine and some of those assets might even be worthless.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under such conditions, this therefore constitutes a direct form of aid. Clearly, if the ECB did not provide this liquidity in exchange for these guarantees, which are actually quite short-lived, then it is possible that some of these financial institutions would go bankrupt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finding an answer to this is not simple; however, in any case, the first step is to have transparency as regards those assets.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Derk Jan Eppink, on his comprehensive and well negotiated report, covering so many topics. Fundamentally, competition policy should be at the heart of the European single market and solid principles of competition should be built into all EU legislation. Competition should create a stronger marketplace for EU citizens and allow the EU to be more competitive on a global basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the latest wave of financial services legislation, there is a danger that this principle is being lost. We must use every opportunity to create more competition in markets dominated by large market participants and create a more vibrant marketplace. In the derivatives legislation currently being negotiated, we can ensure that we do not create or reinforce monopolies by supporting open access to CCPs and the like, and by ensuring the availability of important data streams to all players.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the upcoming review of MiFID, we must remember its original purpose of opening up Europe’s equity markets to competition and, after its expansion to include new asset classes, we must ensure that the competitive principles are upheld, since a combination of these has actually significantly driven down trading fees for investors in the equities over the last three years.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we consider reforms for auditors, credit rating agencies and other financial services providers, we can consider where the barriers to market entry lie, and work to break them down. I believe that standing up for competition in key industries is the way that we will generate the true growth potential of the EU and reinvigorate our economies in this ever-changing world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to this report, the Commission is following a successful policy on competition. However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens. A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice. A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem. A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation. More work is urgently needed on this. For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report sets down pointers for the Commission’s future policy on competition. There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels. It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is not often that I have any good words to say about Gordon Brown, but he did act swiftly, decisively and effectively to deal with the banking crisis in the UK, even though I must point out that it was largely made worse by his disastrous tenure as Minister of Finance/Chancellor of the Exchequer for ten years.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the bank rescue in the UK was less swift than it might have been because of the consequences of EU competition policy. My distinguished colleague, Professor Tim Congdon, has written a pamphlet on this. The fact is that these matters should be handled at the national level and not at the level of the Commission. The Commission simply does not know what it is doing and should stay well clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the last 15 seconds I have, I must address the singularly depressing speech made by Mr Lamberts when he talked about tax competition. Tax competition is why we have lower taxes. What he was advocating was an EU-wide fiscal policy, which would result in EU-wide higher taxes.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to begin by commending you for permitting such dialogue. It is a little unfortunate that the Earl of Dartmouth did not understand that you had also allowed him this opportunity to reply. I believe it is a very positive thing when someone like Mr Lamberts comes forward with such concrete proposals and when we have a chance to engage in lively debate, so that people get to respond in a more direct way, which is exactly what we want in this House. Perhaps you will allow him the opportunity for a brief reply later on.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to continue where Mr Lamberts left off. There is no denying that we need transparency in the banking system. The public is still quite unaware that these subsidies as a result of the financial crisis have actually done something quite unimaginable under EU standards. They make it clear that competition per se cannot always manage without subsidies when there are higher objectives at stake. However, what makes this entire business such a bitter pill to swallow is the fact that those banks that have received support are once again profiteering and, in some cases, actually going against common European interests. That is enough about the financial market.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point I would like to discuss is one you have all heard from me before – the question of pharmaceuticals. It find it very regrettable that we have still not made the progress that has been possible and necessary for decades. It would indeed be a great step forward for Europe if citizens in my country, Austria, as well as in Germany and in other countries, only had to pay the same amount for pharmaceuticals as their fellow citizens in other EU Member States. This is the work of cartels and big business. I believe that the Commission has the opportunity and the duty finally to take action here.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second aspect of this issue is pharmaceutical authorisation. Unnecessary trials are still taking place, both on animals and on human beings. A lot of work is duplicated unnecessarily. In the context of the European internal market, this is something that should have been resolved last century. I would once again call on you to take intensive action here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our eyes are currently on the summit between China and the US, because those two economies are seen as being the world’s two biggest economies. We are discussing when China will become the biggest economy, but that is based on a false assumption, because we forget that the European Union is the biggest economy, but that China and the US have the bigger markets. This is because of the lack of competition in the European Union across borders and within different areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a lack of competition that makes us look upon them, instead of us, as having the self-confidence of being in the lead. That is why it is important, in the future, that the report on competition should also focus on the lack of implementation of the legislation which is already in place, and also on the lack of competition in the European economy. We need to do that in a number of areas. Also, to be the leading economy, we need to ensure that we are the most competitive economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me tell you a secret: we will never be the most competitive if we do not have competition. State subsidies and regulations hindering new entrants are preventing the European economy from being in the lead. That is why we must ensure that state subsidies are always there only in exceptional cases, where nothing else can be done, or when we can channel them in a way that supports the common good without distorting competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need to ensure is that we can allow for new entrants in as many areas of the European economy as possible. Competition is not about out-competing others. It is about allowing big companies to merge and grow bigger and bigger on the global scene, and about allowing new companies to open up to new innovations. We do have a lack here and it is the responsibility of the Commission to demonstrate that, and to take action so we can proceed together so that in the future, we will be looked upon as the leading economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, competition policy is a cornerstone of European legislation. We agree that innovation, creativity and being better necessarily mean market advantage, but we do not accept that, just because someone is bigger and stronger with better connections to information and, in particular, special connections to government, these kinds of advantage should apply on the market, and we are very happy that the Commission is on guard here to ensure that they should not.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to mention once again a new phenomenon: it is not market players but rather governments which seem, from time to time, to be playing by giving special advantages, in terms of competition policy, to some of their favourite companies. This is a very bad phenomenon and it goes back to party treasuries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask the Commission to move in this direction: let us have innovation, creativity and small and medium-sized enterprises, but do not allow any kind of misuse of information or power, either economic or political, on those territories.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Eppink’s report is quite remarkable, but I am a little afraid – and this has nothing to do with the rapporteur – that we are making the same points over and over again. It is rather like flogging a dead horse. Without doubt, I would join Mrs in ’t Veld and Mr Lamberts in saying that we need to have proper monitoring of competition, and to think about what is happening in the agricultural sector, which has very few buyers and a huge number of producers – something that has never worried the Commission before, whereas if this had been the industrial sector, it would have immediately thrown itself into the buyers’ cartel. We also need new rules for the Internet sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, our relationship with the Commission is tremendously boring. It sends us a report which sweeps three-quarters of the subjects under the carpet. We respond politely that it is interesting and that something should be added to it; then everyone puts it away in a drawer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I just wanted to say this today, and to repeat what Mr Hökmark said: the world is changing. It is very nice of us to say that State aid is not good, but the fact remains that China, Korea, the United States and others give State aid. I am not in favour of it. I am not a grassroots protectionist Frenchwoman; I am simply saying: let us open our eyes a little and stop dreaming!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, recommendation number 4 requires the Commission to issue reports on how it handles all future recommendations and to explain any disparities that might arise. I believe that this is a very sensible proposal and wish to make it more specific. Last year, Parliament decided during the relevant debate that we wanted to focus on fair and non-discriminatory competition for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission has done nothing in the interim. This recommendation is once again to be found in Mr Eppink’s motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to hear from the Commission whether it now intends to implement this reiterated recommendation or I would ask them, at the very least, to tell us what it is that is preventing them from taking on board the particular concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises in this way.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point relates to the commodities sector. I am very pleased to find that this report deals with the lack of transparency in the commodities sector. I also welcome the fact that it deals with the question of speculation in commodities. However, I regret that it has not taken up the recommendation of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy as a whole, which suggests that we should not follow the proposal made by the French Presidency, namely, that the issue of speculation should be confined to agricultural commodities, but recommends that speculation in metals should also be included. In my opinion, this is just as important.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Derk Jan Eppink, for his excellent report, but particularly to make a comment about the energy market, which the Commission is going to look at this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">As other Members have pointed out, energy supply and pricing can vary greatly between different Member States. In the region I represent, nearly a quarter of households have no access to mainstream gas, and the vast majority of those are reliant on domestic heating oil. In the one month between November and December, pricing in that market rose by over 50%. Consumers are concerned (and very cold) – they are concerned about cartel pricing, and there are allegations of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is right that this should be looked at by the domestic regulators first, but I am hearing similar concerns from other EU Member States. So I would like to ask the Commissioner: when you are looking at the energy markets this year, please do not forget those who live in very rurally isolated areas.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you could see in our presentation yesterday, the strengthening of the internal market and the promotion of job creation are among the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. Since an EU competition policy based on equal competitive conditions applied in all sectors is the prerequisite of the aforesaid priorities, I am very pleased by the creation of this report. However, ladies and gentlemen, this is now in the distant past. Times have since changed. Nevertheless, I believe it is important to draw the conclusions of this report, and I also find the fact that the European Parliament – that is, we, the Members – will be able to play a more active part in the shaping of competition policy in the future to be important. In this, however, I request the Commission’s cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">First of all, I request what I believe to be a necessity, that Parliament should be informed regularly about all initiatives launched in this field. Secondly, I ask the Commission, as the only competition authority with EU-wide competence, to report to Parliament annually about the application of the recommendations made by it, and about any deviations from them.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that it is important to realise – and in this I agree with my fellow Members – that competition policy cannot be managed vertically. Coordination is also required in all functional and regulatory areas. This, however, is the responsibility of the Commission. For this reason, it is essential to harmonise EU policies and the priorities defined in the EU 2020 strategy, which is aimed at supporting growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Lastly, I too would like to mention small and medium-sized enterprises, whose involvement is indispensable and unavoidable for the growth of the entire European economy, including, of course, employment. However, the conditions of competition must be equal. This must be guaranteed by competition policy. I ask the Commission to pay special attention to SMEs and to provide equitable and non-discriminatory competitive conditions for them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first let me congratulate Mr Eppink on the detailed work he has done on this report. Hopefully, he will continue to play a progressive role in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome this report on the state of play of competition policy for 2009. However, there are still elements of competition in the EU that need to be strengthened and clarified. I would encourage more cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament in this field. That is the only way we will be able to maintain public confidence in the decisions that have been taken. Furthermore, it is imperative that the European Parliament be kept up to date on the action that is taken by the Commission, with a particular focus on SME policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to the reports and the investigations that have been highlighted in this report – at the last count, 11 reports, six investigations into different fields and the re-establishment of DG Competition’s fiscal State aid unit. In particular, I strongly welcome the reiterated request for the incorporation of the basis for calculating fines, which we have already discussed. I think this is absolutely vital.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, it was very interesting to hear earlier from the Earl of Dartmouth, speaking as he was as an aristocrat, about competition policy. As everybody knows, aristocrats in the United Kingdom have a huge focus on land concentration. Perhaps we ought to ask the competition authorities to look into that and see just how the aristocrats have been looking after their land across the European Union for all this time.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is a pleasure to listen to this debate. I would like to thank Mr Eppink for his report. Knowing his approach, I look at the report with admiration and am pleased that it was he who drafted it. It is also a pleasure to listen to the speeches of fellow Members, but there is something which I feel I must say. We are concentrating, here, on the work of the European Commission. We are accusing it of not having a strong position or a policy and of not fighting protectionism, but quite honestly, our opponent or our greatest problem – Mr Hökmark spoke about the fact that the European economy is not competitive – is the Member States. Meanwhile, the European Commission very often has no option but – acting under pressure from Member States – to try to protect free competition as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this Chamber several weeks ago, we talked among other things about special legislation for the coal market. On that occasion, however, we did not hear Members talking about free competition, but could only hear the voices of people demanding protectionist principles and the possibility of subsidising, for example, closed mines – that is what it was called – while in fact, the real issue was assistance for mines which are not going to be closed at all. We must, therefore, be consistent in our work, and that consistency is often lacking in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have been talking about assistance for the banking sector. I fear that the European Commission, acting under that pressure from Member States, has only sanctioned that assistance, and today, when we talk about the report, which is, in fact, for 2009 – I agree, here, with the criticism – it seems to me that the report lacks an evaluation of the effects which that assistance has achieved and if, in reality, it has restructured the banking industry in a stable way. I expect, Commissioner, that this aspect – the evaluation of an important policy – should be present in the report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report also talks about the fact that the Commission is fighting protectionism, among others when we talk about the automotive sector, but there are examples – I come from Poland – where the best factory in the Fiat group was closed – perhaps not closed, but production was reduced – and production was transferred to Italy. This is obvious protectionism, and the European Commission should be fighting this problem.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I can give another example. In 2009, two Polish shipyards were closed. I come from a shipbuilding city in Poland, but the problem is bigger than two Polish shipyards. The problem is to do with the fact that, at world level, European competition policy forces the shipbuilding industry to fight mainly against the heavily subsidised shipyards of the Middle East, and today we have, in fact, closed down the shipbuilding industry in Europe through this competition policy, because we force them to compete against subsidised industries. It should be important to us for the shipbuilding industry in Europe to exist. Thank you, and I apologise for exceeding my speaking time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would argue that developing an effective competition policy and implementing it correctly from a methodological point of view is an extremely delicate and complex task, particularly during a crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is delicate, because applying it too rigidly could genuinely affect the impact it has, and could have serious consequences for the social sphere and the economic cycle. It is complex, because the parameters adopted may not necessarily apply across the board to all areas of the economy at such a delicate time. Therefore, the Commission should be congratulated for its work on the subject. It has managed to combine a rigorous method with the flexibility necessary in these economic conditions. Indeed, making provision to evaluate the ad hoc tools adopted at national level to end the crisis is evidence of an approach that is not only highly professional, but also sensitive.</p>
      <p sl="it">European competition law is both wide-ranging in scope and highly specialised. This once again puts the European Union in the position of being a guiding light for its neighbouring countries, particularly the less developed ones. This helps prevent a separation and divergence between the countries leading the way and those following behind. Therefore, it is doubly important to ensure that this guiding light is not dimmed in any way. In my opinion, special attention should be paid to evaluating the various post-crisis scenarios that should begin to emerge in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is very likely that this will mean re-examining the extent of the structural changes that we need to take into account and evaluating the current status of the various industries and sectors. Caution has to be the keyword at a time of such uncertainty.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would urge the Commission to focus both on small and medium-sized enterprises and on youth employment, which is once more making competition a European-wide problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to commend the report for including a very positive mention about SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area. Time and again this Parliament has demanded a rapid SEPA migration, and the reasons are simple. The Commission’s impact assessment quotes a study that SEPA would save EUR 300 billion in the EU economy in six years’ time. These savings are due to increased competition via common standards and processes. This will also save time and stress for all Europeans who need to carry out payments in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also strongly agree with the report when it states that the public economic support to banks and other companies in the economic crisis has distorted competition. Like many of my colleagues here this morning, I urge the Commission to provide an analysis of these distortions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me add one more thought on the need for common standards and processes. A lot of inventions in the future will be based on information and communication technologies. We need more competition in the ICT business, and this could be encouraged by increased use of open-source code in Europe. I expect that Europe will, in this way, become more competitive in this crucial field in relation to the US and other major economic areas, as Mr Hökmark said previously.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the authors of the resolution under discussion rightly observe that the economic crisis was an exceptional challenge for EU competition policy. National and political interests were repeatedly victorious, not only over the rules of the free market, but also over common sense. The major economic crisis, the effects of which are still being felt to this day in the countries of Europe, was a significant determinant of competition policy in 2009. It was a period which saw the use of mechanisms and instruments whose main objective was to help troubled financial institutions as well as some large enterprises, and not to uphold the rules of a market economy, and the worst effects of this were felt by small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Will what was done be effective in the long term? Only now are we finding out. Therefore, we should call on the Commission to prepare credible analyses which show the effect of this aid on the economy. This will not only allow an evaluation of what was done, but will also enable a rapid and effective reaction to similar threats in the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, competition policy plays a key role in guaranteeing the European economy’s competitiveness, with the control of State aid being an integral part of this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, during the current crisis, the European Commission has seen the need to approve State aid grants, especially for the banking sector, but also for other sectors which have encountered difficulties. Member States have therefore granted sizeable sums in the form of guarantee schemes, recapitalisation schemes and other forms of financing banking institutions’ liquidity, with the aim of providing them with a source of funding and a guarantee against risks.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the European Commission must keep a close watch on the sector and submit plans for restructuring and regulating financial institutions to guarantee that they will not continue to adopt risky behaviour which jeopardises the European Union’s financial stability. Otherwise, State aid is only helping perpetuate financial difficulties in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the submitted report confirms the fact that we still have a long way to go in the EU as far as proper competition is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A good example of this is agricultural output, where both the EU and the individual states allow various subsidies and supports, thereby greatly distorting the competitive environment. Agricultural enterprises from the new Member States in particular are suffering considerably as a result of the incorrect subsidy policy of the EU. Transport is another area where it will be necessary to amend and improve the competitive environment in a fundamental way. I therefore consider it very important to adopt the proposals of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which aptly draw attention to a distortion in competition between individual types of transport as well.</p>

Notwithstanding, it is a good report, as reflected by Parliament’s resolution. However, there are points where work could be improved in the near future, primarily in the field of prevention and appropriate information. Without cooperation, we will not be able to recover from the crisis, and it is therefore very important for the Commission to assure us that it will continuously provide us with information about results already achieved. Compliance with, and enforcement of, EU competition policy rules is one of the keys to the success of the single market. There are still raw material markets in the field of energy policy, for example, where transparency needs to be increased. Similarly, competition is not fully guaranteed in every segment of the energy sector. This is why it is urgent to implement the second internal market package and the third energy package. Requesting a more thorough investigation of competition in another sector, namely agro-industry, is a very timely step. Through a study, we must identify the major suppliers and distributors who are responsible for distorting competition in the market.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me concentrate on paragraph 90 of this report, which states that competition in agricultural production is a precondition for lower prices for consumers in EU countries. A bit of it is true, but I am afraid it misses the point completely. We are having a debate among ourselves, and in particular groups in this Parliament, about what is happening to the agricultural markets and why there is not fair transmission of the final price that we, as consumers, pay for food to those who produce the food.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a very serious problem at a time when we are reforming agricultural policy, threatening to cut the budget for agriculture and not looking at the imperfections in this marketplace. So the report should say much more about that. The Commission is urged to look at competition in the agro-industrial sector: yes, please, and look at it too in the retail sector but then stop looking and do something about it! We are great at talking in this House, but we are not so good at action.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have one other point in relation to competition. I make some complaints to the Commission on behalf of constituents. The small person gets no hearing against the state, and I would like the Commission to take this back: that there are some complaints which I, as a Member, have not …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the internal market should be free, effective, dynamic and innovative. Appropriate competition policy is the right tool for achieving this objective. If competition is operating properly in the market for goods and services, we can guarantee better quality, lower prices and greater choice for the consumer. It is good that we make these annual assessments of competition policy. Such an examination, with the benefit of hindsight, is very instructive. Effective use of the instrument of competition policy allowed an improvement in economic stability and moderation of the effects of the economic crisis for businesses and consumers. It is necessary to improve competition in the markets for medicines and energy. Let us remember that a monopoly, whether privately-owned or state-owned, restricts competition. It is worth stressing that changes to the common agricultural policy mean that subsidies and external support do not now restrict competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission notes Parliament’s call for more transparency, dialogue and information on competition policy. We will continue to inform you about important policy decisions relating to competition and will endeavour to address your requests in our response to your resolution, either in the next Report on Competition Policy or on an ad hoc basis, as requested by Mr Bütikofer and other Members.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note your call for sector inquiries in a number of markets. Past experience shows that fair and firm enforcement itself produces positive effects on competition across a sector. Sector inquiries are not always the best way to enforce our rules in a given sector. They are very expensive in terms of resources and should be used only when the Commission’s policy objectives make an inquiry necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can confirm again that the temporary crisis-related State aid measures are indeed temporary. I would like to pick up on a few of your questions in a really telegraphic way in the limited time available.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, on the investment and financial sector, consultation is ongoing on rescue and restructuring guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on transport, the Commission is preparing a White Paper on the future of transport, which is due to be adopted in March 2011. This will outline several proposals for speeding up completion of the internal market for transport.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, on services of general economic interest, the Commission will report on this in the first quarter of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, on the digital agenda, the Commission fully agrees with the importance of promoting a truly integrated digital internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fifthly, on SMEs, a level playing field for all companies, big and small, is essential for them to flourish. The Commission’s enforcement of the competition rules is essential to enable this. We also have targeted State aid rules for SMEs, innovation, research and development and green technologies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next June, Vice-President Almunia will present to you the Report on Competition Policy 2010. In the meantime, he will keep you informed on the issues you have raised and, in relation to paragraph 4 of Parliament’s report, the services of DG COMP will be instructed to respond to you in more detail.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, who is standing in for his colleague, for being here. I welcome the initiative of the Commission with regard to collective redress, which is a long-overdue initiative. It is also mentioned in the report, and I think it is in the interests of the consumers – provided it is well defined and well legislated. I think it is good. We will start with the Green Paper to see what the different opinions are. I welcome this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the banking sector, we have a very strange situation: State aid is on different levels in different countries, in different stages. In some countries, such as Spain, in the banking sector, the regional banks (cajas) in particular are in difficulty, and here, life-support from the European Central Bank is needed – although the ECB, as Mr Lamberts pointed out in 30 seconds, risks having many bad assets. This turns the ECB into a sort of bad bank – something we should not have.</p>
      <p sl="en">In other countries, the states are trying to disengage from the banking sector, and here there is the danger of a dowry. I expect that you cannot reply to this issue of a dowry – it is something for the Commissioner – but it would be very unfair to other banks that did not get State aid if some that have been recovered or needed resuscitation suddenly got one. So here we have to look at the issue of the level playing field.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I come to the follow-up, because there were a few remarks by Mrs in ’t Veld, Mrs Gáll and Mr Bütikofer which were spot-on. We had a report last year, we have a report this year and we will probably have a similar report next year. It all stays the same. It looks a bit like a Vatican-based ritual where we have the same things over and over again. I think that we have to look into the follow-up to the questions we have asked, and I propose that the rapporteur and the previous rapporteur get in touch with the Commissioner and with the Director-General of DG COMP to see what happens with the request we made.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to have a report that is properly implemented in terms of information provision. This is why I propose that we have a proper follow-up, in which Mrs in ’t Veld will certainly support me, to see what the Commission is doing.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mr Gahler, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a sustainable EU policy for the High North (2009/2214(INI)) (A7-0377/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-055-000" speaker_id="2341" name="Michael GAHLER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="22-04-1960" birth_place="Frankfurt/Main" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of our Arctic neighbours who are following this debate, in my capacity as rapporteur, I am particularly pleased to be able to present to you today the result of over a year’s work, carried out in cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, other colleagues in the EU Arctic Forum, and numerous experts and representatives, some of them from the Artic region itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have achieved a broad consensus and believe that we have formulated a sustainable policy on the High North. The report analyses the new significance of the Arctic region and describes how the EU’s policy in relation to our northern neighbours should be organised from the point of view of the European Parliament. My guiding principle here is the offer of cooperation with the states and institutions of our neighbours in the High North.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are aware of the bilateral and multilateral cooperation already taking place with the Arctic states. Quite apart from the issues relating to the Arctic, Norway and Iceland are already closely involved in the European Economic Area and in cooperation under Schengen. The EU is already an ad hoc observer in the Arctic Council, but I would like to make it clear that I believe it desirable that the EU should be given permanent observer status. This is particularly the case because almost all policy areas of relevance to the region have been brought within the Community sphere in part at least. This offer of cooperation is formulated in this way because we, the EU, cannot take action or initiate any activity in the Arctic in our own right. We are largely dependent on the willingness of the immediately adjacent territories to cooperate with us.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this report, I also focused on the human dimension. In pursuing each individual area of common policy, all those involved must never lose sight of the fact that the concerns of those living in the Arctic must be given due consideration. I am referring to the indigenous peoples in the countries, whose way of life and livelihoods follow the principle of sustainability, as well as for the other people living there.</p>
      <p sl="de">We accept that these inhabitants of the Arctic region wish to develop their habitat; in other words, they do not want to see a conservation order placed on the area as it currently stands, turning it into something like a national park. That is why we are working with the partners to ensure that intervention in the ecosystem and in natural habitats always follows the highest possible conservationist principles. The EU is an attractive cooperative partner for Arctic states because we have played a pioneering role in the relevant policy areas, such as protection of the environment and the combating of climate change. Thus, the question of whether or not the world’s largest internal market pursues an ambitious environmental policy makes a vital difference for this region.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU is also an attractive cooperative partner because we are obvious customers for the commodities provided by the Arctic – not just oil and gas, but also rare ores, for example. We should follow the good examples provided here, for example, in the cooperation between Norway and Russia in the Shtokman Field in the Barents Sea. The highest Norwegian environmental standards are applied here as the partners cooperate in extracting these mineral resources. I hope that the same will apply to the cooperative agreement reached between Russia and BP in recent weeks for exploration in the Arctic Sea. In future, our monitoring satellites will provide valuable support, both in the environmental sector and in the opening up of new shipping routes, such as the Northeast Passage. Cooperation in this area will make it possible to shorten shipping routes to Southeast Asia, for example. For the EU, which accounts for about 40% of the world’s commercial fleet, this is an important factor, particularly from a financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our Framework Programme for Research offers valuable support for further scientific cooperation between the various Polar institutes in their research stations in the Arctic. Our neighbours in the High North know the EU to be a competent cooperative partner. However, there is room for improvement when it comes to the formulation, coordination and implementation of our policies. Improvement could be achieved by bringing together the responsible areas within the Commission under the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and by establishing an appropriate body in the EEAS. In addition, an Arctic information centre to gather and evaluate all the relevant information would also further improve our database. The development of a circumpolar cofinancing and programming mechanism involving all the partners in the High North would also be an important instrument for better, more efficient cooperation in respect of research and development.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am confident that this draft policy document will provide better guidelines for a comprehensive and successful Arctic policy in the EU that will also benefit our northern neighbours.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, early last year, Vice-President/High Representative Ashton took the initiative of proposing a debate on the Arctic region. The plenary debate has helped us to receive your views and to illustrate the importance we attach to Arctic cooperation as part of the external relations of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We engage with the Arctic region on many levels. Firstly, both the Union and Member States have active research policies in the region. Secondly, we pursue solid environmental and maritime policies. Thirdly, our diplomacy in the fight against climate change addresses the core origin of Arctic transformations. And fourthly, we continue to take action in favour of indigenous peoples worldwide, including those living in the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we acknowledge that our dialogue with all circumpolar Arctic indigenous peoples could be improved, 2010 has witnessed the beginning of a fruitful and wider process of interaction, which we will certainly pursue in the years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">When dealing with access to the Arctic and the exploitation of its resources, we must live up to our reputation as a responsible consumer of raw materials and energy resources, adhering to the highest safety and environmental standards. In parallel, we will firmly seek fair treatment of our interests, including those of our companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are pleased to see that these areas are covered by Parliament’s High North report, along with valuable proposals on how to proceed in the future. This report is an important contribution to the gradual building of the European Union’s Arctic policy, and I would like to thank Michael Gahler for taking this initiative forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">The initiative is particularly praiseworthy, as the rapporteur and several other MEPs facilitated an interesting dialogue with Arctic third parties and civil society, in which we participated actively. The various perspectives are present in the final report, demonstrating the European Union’s commitment to listen to, and work with, all Arctic stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now opening a new phase in the development of EU Arctic policy. Parliament’s report will become the third pillar of its basic architecture, following the 2008 Commission communication and the 2009 Council conclusions. These three texts are consistent and offer a responsible and positive message to the Arctic partner countries and the people living across the region. We seek to promote a safer, sustainable Arctic. We respect the international agreements and arrangements, and would like to cooperate in their development and enhancement.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, I would like to acknowledge the Norwegian-Russian delimitation agreement on the Barents Sea, which was signed last year, as a reference point for long-term peaceful cooperation in the overall circumpolar Arctic region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union would like to see a reinforced and efficient Arctic Council, in which key decisions on the future of the region are agreed and implemented. We would like to participate in the Arctic Council as a permanent observer to share our solid experience in international regional cooperation, and we are particularly grateful for Parliament’s endorsement of this endeavour.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High North report will give the European External Action Service and the Commission a robust stimulus in our external action concerning the Arctic region. I believe that its messages and approach are timely and appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s High North report will also inform our own progress report on EU Arctic policy, which the Council has asked us to deliver later this year. Our reporting will be addressed to both institutions, Council and Parliament, and we hope that it will be to your joint satisfaction.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank Mr Gahler for his carefully prepared report. I am genuinely pleased that the European Union’s policy towards the High North is one of those areas to which the European Union has turned in relatively good time. Significantly rich resources – around a quarter of the world’s unexplored oil and gas resources, biogenetic and fish resources, minerals – may be found in the Arctic. It also offers new maritime transport opportunities. Melting of the ice cap has resulted in a shipping route to the countries of Asia that is about 40% shorter. The potential of the Arctic is impressive. That is why it must be husbanded responsibly. Both irresponsible exploitation of resources and ill-considered transport flows can have serious ecological consequences. At the same time, it has to be recognised that using the riches of the Arctic can open new possibilities for resolving not only energy problems, but also raw material and food-related problems. There is stiff competition between the world’s great powers over who is to have the lion’s share in managing and exploiting these resources. Although approximately 3.7 million people live in the Arctic, representing several tens of indigenous peoples, it can nevertheless be regarded to a certain extent as belonging to the world in common. For the time being, the United Nations has not confirmed privileges for any nation in the Arctic and, hopefully, will not do so in the future. That is precisely why our policy must be responsible. The European Union must develop a specific, coordinated strategy for all spheres associated with the High North, and agree the funding for that policy and the sources of that funding. Climate change, the welfare and development of the local population, and energy security issues must also be taken into account. In order to implement that policy, permanent observer status on the Arctic Council would be important. Although we have no direct sea frontiers with the Arctic, the European Union can become a leader in exploring the region in respect of both its resources and new shipping routes, and in securing a high standard of environmental safety. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, to begin with, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Gahler, for his constructive cooperation. Certainly the best acknowledgement of this came from Commissioner Füle, when he said that this report would become the third pillar of EU Arctic policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is not any wonder that Arctic policy is becoming central to international policy, since, just as the Member who spoke before me said, the Arctic region has a third of the world’s as yet undiscovered natural resources: minerals, gas and oil. Climate change and competition for these natural resources are issues that are connected, but what is really driving the trend is obviously the global economy. Fortunately, developments in the Arctic region have been steady and based on a willingness to cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the future, Arctic policy will be a test of whether together, we can increase stability or, on the other hand, cause new conflicts. It is important that natural resources are exploited responsibly and carefully in order to avoid the ‘gold rush’ phenomenon and catastrophes of the sort that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important that we have a balanced report and the message that the Arctic Council should be reinforced and that the European Union will be more robustly involved there in its capacity as observer. We should not just barge our way in, however, but exercise diplomacy, negotiate, engage in sound political cooperation and, above all, be at the forefront when it comes to assessing environmental impact. I think that it is excellent that the report mentions the importance of an Arctic Information Centre and also states that the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi, Finland, would be a good place to locate it.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Gahler, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. We think that we have worked excellently together and it is important that the own-initiative report is adopted and that a proposal is made based on it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report argues strongly in favour of heavy future investment allowing people in the Arctic region to survive there, and investment in conditions of employment, transport and the environment. I also think that the view it takes regarding the need to recognise the position of the indigenous nations, especially the Sami, is of particular importance. The Sami are Europe’s only indigenous people and the EU, that is the Commission, Parliament and the Council, must cooperate equally with them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report also acknowledges the status of the Arctic Council, which Commissioner Füle even said the EU was willing to reinforce. I was, however, really quite disappointed with Commissioner Füle’s appraisal that cooperation in the Arctic region was progressing gradually. Of course, the EU must show drive, and there must be investment and a desire to step up cooperation in the Arctic. That must not be allowed to progress only gradually, almost as if we were only using one hand: it must be one of the priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I want to say that I am also pleased that there is to be investment in research into the Arctic region, and that the report mentions the University of Lapland as a possible centre for this. The University of Lapland deserves praise for being the only university, the only agency, that has really worked to ensure that such a centre would be established, and has devoted much time and effort to this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my gratitude and give my sincerest congratulations and compliments to the rapporteur and fellow shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation and understanding. I would also like to thank my fellow Green Members for their cooperation and contribution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can finally say that we have come up with a decent document allowing us, the European Union, to proceed in a fairly reasonable manner, taking into account all the interests of all stakeholders. Even though the Greens justifiably think that we should be even more radical, we are still glad that this report takes our worries and concerns into account, such as the proposals we made to the rapporteur concerning the fact that scientific data clearly demonstrates that the Arctic ecosystem is currently going through massive climate-related changes and that this situation requires a precautionary and scientifically robust approach to be taken to any future development in the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we called for further scientific studies, within the framework of a multilateral agreement to be completed, to inform international understanding and decision making for the Arctic ecosystem before any further major development goes ahead. We thank the other groups for accepting that. This is an example of how to put things in a congenial form for our wide range of different constituencies. There are some sceptics in this room who have stated that the Arctic region does not deserve our attention, but it does, particularly with Iceland likely to become the 28th member of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Arctic is ‘cool’. This is not because of climate change and the consequent warming up of the normally cold High North. The Arctic is also ‘cool’ because of the lucrative possibilities emerging on the horizon, even though they bring with them very complex and difficult problems. That is why I think politicians who tackle these problems in a responsible and politically subtle manner are ‘cool’ politicians, as are those of us who will vote for Mr Gahler’s report today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Arctic is definitely changing. The most obvious results of these changes are the possibility of establishing new transportation and trade routes, and the possibility, which is already clearly in view, of exploiting natural resources and extracting oil and gas. World reactions to these changes are chaotic. On the one hand, we have the very constructive Norwegian-Russian delimitation agreement on the Barents Sea, while on the other, we also have the Russians attempting to pursue a policy of faits accomplis . I think there is a huge role to be played here by the European Union and the international community. We give encouragement for this in the report, and it has been expressed well there. The second matter to which we have drawn attention is the necessity of achieving a guarantee of equal, non-discriminatory access to transportation routes. Neither regulatory nor financial considerations should be an obstacle in this equal access to routes. This has all been expressed well in the report. Therefore, we will be pleased to endorse the report in the vote.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, many thanks to Mr Gahler for his report. It is clear, also from this report, that there is enormous interest in the natural resources of the Arctic region. As a result of climate change, oil and gas and other resources can be extracted increasingly easily. The issue of making better use of shipping routes has already been discussed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The logical consequence of this is that pollution will increase in the region. Industrial development – in particular, through the extraction of oil and gas, the expansion of commercial fishing and increased shipping traffic – will all necessarily lead to the disturbance, or perhaps even destruction, of this highly sensitive ecosystem, with devastating consequences.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, this report deals in generalities and does not contain any effective strategies for combating these dangers. A point that is not mentioned is the fact that the EU is not alone in recognising the increased geostrategic significance of the Arctic. The bordering states of Russia and NATO members USA, Canada, Denmark and Norway have already begun militarising the Arctic region and intend to protect their interests there.</p>
      <p sl="de">Climate change has led to this situation in the Arctic. We need to prevent the catastrophic progress of this change, something that can only be achieved through a rapid changeover to renewable energy sources. However, this strategy takes a diametrically opposite approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot. In common with numerous environmental organisations, we are calling for a moratorium on new oil extraction projects in the Arctic. A treaty needs to be agreed – similar to the Treaty on the Antarctic – that prohibits the extraction of mineral resources in the region. Last but not least, we are calling for the immediate demilitarisation of the region and therefore for the establishment of the Arctic as a demilitarised zone.</p>
      <p sl="de">Because my group and I are unable to support the results of the own-initiative report presented here, the GUE/NGL has submitted an alternative report.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I would like to ask how the representative of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left thinks it possible that we could achieve some sort of moratorium when none of the actors or countries in the region wants one. How would the indigenous peoples view it if the European Union were to tell them what to do from above? Parliament has already committed one sin, the ban on the sale of seal products, which has angered them a good deal. Why should we annoy them even more? Now it is diplomacy and cooperation that are needed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am not in favour of that and, of course, it is not possible to impose this from above. The question remains, however: Who was consulted? Which states are involved? Which indigenous peoples are affected? Was there any consultation with the people who may benefit from the situation, or with those who may lose their livelihood? I think that further dialogue is needed. The talks held so far are not enough. We need to try to keep this dialogue as broad as possible, also consulting with wider sections of society, possibly including the indigenous peoples in particular.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my deep appreciation for the sterling work done by rapporteur Gahler.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Arctic is of strategic importance, especially now that the warming of the Arctic region seems to have opened up opportunities for transport and resource extraction there. It is also an area where the environment is very fragile, especially as a result of pollution from Europe, North America, Russia and China. The fact that national claims to the Arctic are not always clear is a complicating factor. Although the EU will not have access to the Arctic coastline before the accession of Iceland, the EU does have Member States in the Arctic region.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore support an EU strategy for the Arctic regions which will position the EU squarely alongside the other major powers, in particular Russia, which is clearly bent on exploiting this region economically. If the economic activities intensify over the coming years, then it will be important that we ensure a proper balance between the environment and economics and, in doing so, that we involve the local population. Securing an observer status for the EU in the Arctic Council would be a good step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as we know, the Arctic’s untold mineral resources have made the area the subject of heated dispute. It is estimated that 90 billion barrels of oil alone lie untapped under the ice. Inevitably, there is a certain feeling of unease that British Petroleum of all companies, having caused the oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico last year, is now to be allowed to extract resources in this sensitive natural environment, where conditions are far more extreme than in the Gulf.</p>
      <p sl="de">After all, the fact is that the Arctic region already provides the final resting place for the world’s mercury emissions. Nonetheless, in view of the global demand for energy, it is probably unrealistic to expect a decision to be taken to forego the Arctic’s oil resources. It is to be hoped that the European Union, in its role in the Arctic Council, will ensure that better safety standards are put in place, so that the Arctic’s wildlife does not suffer a similar horrific fate to that in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the recent oil disaster.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, from the EU’s perspective, the Arctic is also of essential importance for the development of new world trade routes. If it were indeed possible to open up a new shipping route between Europe, Asia and North America, this would immediately circumvent piracy in Somalia, while also saving the EU a lot of money because the Atalanta Mission would no longer be necessary. Of course, this is to assume that the indigenous Inuit populations would not be driven to similarly desperate measures such as piracy as a result of losing their livelihoods. This is something that needs to be kept in mind both when planning shipping routes and when drilling for oil.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I too, of course, would like to thank Mr Gahler for his very good draft resolution and his fruitful cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For me, the most important matter during work on this report was the increased significance given to research into and monitoring of environment change, because the information gained is crucial in making political and economic decisions. It looks as if economic matters like fisheries, transport and natural resources are the main object of the European Union’s interest. This is a pity, because there is no doubt that science allows us to assess what influence economic changes have on the environment in the region. An influence which is significantly greater than in other regions. What exactly is this influence? Only the experts can tell us.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the openness of research in the Arctic is being increasingly restricted by the states which have access to the Arctic Ocean. Even in areas covered by international conventions and treaties, in the last two or three years, there has been a significant reduction in freedom of activity and research, often under the pretence of protecting the environment. Climatic and oceanic processes in the Arctic have a significant effect on climate and environment change, so freedom of research is extremely important for understanding what is going on, not only in the Arctic itself, but more importantly here, where we are. Furthermore, the work which has already been completed on these issues by scientists from countries outside the Arctic and the money which has been spent entitle us to make our voice heard on matters concerning the northern polar region.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Gahler for his very careful and detailed report, and indeed for his willingness to compromise. However, I fear that we have produced the proverbial Christmas tree – albeit it post-Christmas – of wishes, and of wishes that obscure the main political point.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our previous debates on Arctic policy in this Chamber provoked, indeed, the Commission communication. We insisted very clearly then on the protection of the fragile Arctic environment in a coherent way – on protection of this last wilderness, which is now an environmental flashpoint.</p>
      <p sl="en">There seems to have been a very subtle shift – an undertow – in our thinking, towards security: security of energy supply and security to use resources. This has been confirmed by the agreement this weekend between Rosneft and BP – BP of Deepwater.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Commission and other commentators have persistently pointed out, there are many, many regulatory gaps in the Arctic. The EU’s environmental footprint there is not light.</p>
      <p sl="en">The regulation is piecemeal and unfocused. The field is open to multinational companies. We could do better. We previously said we wanted to do better. We wanted a more coherent approach. I wonder what has changed, and I think our citizens might ask what has changed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, congratulate Michael Gahler on a well-balanced, excellent report. Despite the challenging nature of the environment in the Arctic, the rising price of oil has stimulated international interest in drilling in that zone. We all know that oil was first produced in 1968 from Prudhoe Bay on the Alaskan North Slope, but many areas of the Arctic have not yet been explored.</p>
      <p sl="en">A 2008 US geological survey estimated that areas north of the Arctic Circle have 90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil – technically recoverable oil – and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. Now this represents between 13% and 20% of all undiscovered oil in the world. Needless to say, the recovery of so much oil will have a dramatic impact on the Arctic and may cause ecological disasters on a global scale, so I think we have to ask ourselves whether it is wise to embark on such a project at a time of determined efforts to sever our dependency on fossil fuels and to aim ultimately for a CO2 -free society.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, for some reason, reading the Commission’s communication on the Arctic makes me think of a cat licking its lips at the prospect of a saucer of cream. Global warming and the melting of the ice at the North Pole are certainly opening up new opportunities: natural resources, oil, fish, shipping and so on. We have heard all about this. However, I think it is important for the EU not to get too excited, as it does not have any coastline along the Arctic Ocean. As a Dane, it strikes me as rather pathetic that Denmark is being used as one of the justifications for the EU’s Arctic connections. The fact of the matter is that Denmark’s only connection to the Arctic is via Greenland, which, in a referendum 26 years ago, decided to leave the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="da">Likewise, the EU should not expect too much in relation to Iceland, either. The decision on Iceland’s membership must be taken by the Icelandic people alone, without pressure from the EU. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that there is a majority in favour of EU membership there.</p>
      <p sl="da">Thus, instead of seeing ourselves as a potential Arctic power, the EU should perhaps recognise its geographic location and instead work to attain good neighbourly relations with the countries that are actually situated in the Arctic. This includes our friends in the western Nordic countries, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It should be the job of the European Parliament, in particular, to ensure this.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this is an important issue, and because Finland is situated in the north, I am familiar with these matters. For once, I can agree with my Finnish fellow Members that they in Lapland and at the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi know about these things. I also agree about the position of the indigenous peoples.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I will vote in favour of this report, although my biggest criticism is targeted at the climate change claims, according to which we should have an agreement based, as it were, on the views of the EU. Emissions trading in the EU has failed completely. In 2008, it was revealed that there had been abuses, VAT swindles and many other scams to the tune of EUR 5 billion. Furthermore, these have grown steadily in number. Emissions trading simply does not work; it is harmful. To take its place, we need a system of specific emissions, as there is with vehicles, where one can measure who is doing the emitting and what is being emitted, and not engage in an international trade in indulgence where people buy the right to pollute. This is an important matter.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Arctic issue is also important, though I am not very sure how it will progress when I consider the recent action taken by the EU. The things that the EU touches do not necessarily go ahead. The Danish Member spoke here sensibly about the regions which are there. They are regions with sovereign rights, which they may exercise to take decisions on their own matters.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague, Michael Gahler, for the excellent report he presented. This report encourages the Council and Commission to outline a specific EU Arctic policy, while highlighting that Iceland’s possible accession to the European Union would turn the Union into one of the Arctic’s coastal entities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As this Parliament’s rapporteur for Iceland, I would like to stress that this country has Arctic priorities compatible with the European Union. These are strengthening the Arctic Council’s political and administrative role, followed by ensuring the region’s sustainable development and, lastly, I would like to remind you about supporting the indigenous populations’ rights. The fact as well that both Iceland and the European Union are currently in the process of devising an Arctic strategy may provide an opportunity to coordinate both policies, among other reasons, with regard to the European Union’s application for permanent observer status in the Arctic Council.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to conclude by saying that the European Union can obviously contribute to effective multilateral governance in the High North. I would also like to tell Mr Søndergaard that I listened very closely to what he said about the majority in Iceland. I believe that we are facing a lengthy process which could go through numerous changes. In my view, we are in the position to encourage a responsible pre-accession process and a mainly balanced debate in this country about the European Union.</p>

Some colleagues have said that countries should deal with problems that arise individually and that there is no need for so much coordination here. I categorically reject this opinion. It is precisely the European Union, which has the greatest experience of how to work together and really go into unchartered territory, which should play a very important role in this region. It is, after all, clear – either confrontation, an uncertain scramble and conflicts, or peaceful cooperation and a region that could be an example to other countries around the world. One other dimension – profit, or economic benefits, or the environment and conservation. I believe that the European Union, which always led the way in the fight against climate change, must continue to place more emphasis on the second dimension when harmonising both approaches.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, the Arctic area is changing significantly as a result of climate change, with ice and snow melting. New shipping routes are opening up, fishing grounds are available and there are more and better opportunities for viable oil and gas exploration.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I do not speak as a Member living at the Arctic Circle either; I only wish to warn everyone that the North Pole does not only hold economic heritage and energy heritage, but it is also one of the greatest examples of our natural heritage. It is therefore very important that the companies that are going to conduct explorations and drillings in that area do not go there with the profit-mongering mindset of the gold diggers of old, but instead with the sense of European responsibility that took shape by the 20th and early 21st century. Let us not forget that work there will have to be performed under extremely harsh weather conditions and through the use of new technologies. It is of the utmost importance that we do not make concessions in this, and that we apply rules, standards and requirements to these companies, which enable the technical management of this issue at the most up-to-date technological standard, while financial funds should be available to prevent any kind of natural disaster, such as the one we have seen in the case of Deep Horizon.

It is quite true to say that Europe needs to adapt continuously to new realities and to deal with changes in the balance of political power. In relation to Arctic policy, this means: we must understand that the Arctic states wish to develop the region themselves, but that they are open to cooperation. They are not interested in new treaties, but want to see existing regulatory treaties being developed further.</p>

In relation to the Arctic, this means the EU has an opportunity for greater cooperation and development.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, this report contains fine words on climate concerns and environmental considerations, but in reality, it is about the EU’s hunt for resources in the Arctic. It talks about the expected quantities of oil, gas, minerals, forests and fish that the EU will be able to exploit in the near future. It states that the EU has large areas of land in Sweden and Finland, but does not mention that these are Swedish and Finnish areas. It also claims that the Union has exclusive competences with regard to the conservation of marine biological resources. I am not sure that the Greenlandic, Russian and Canadian Inuits would agree with that.</p>
      <p sl="da">Just because the Arctic is sparsely populated does not mean that anyone can go there and help themselves. The area cannot support mass tourism, overfishing and the plundering of raw materials on a massive scale.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think it is good that the European Union is developing policies and strategies for broad regions such as the Baltic, the Danube and my own region, the Atlantic, and today discussing the High North.</p>
      <p sl="en">But in dealing with the High North, it is important that we are seen to be diplomatic, not didactic; cooperative, not coercive; and explorative, not exploitive. Because of the importance of the indigenous people, they must be given primacy of consideration, and there are companies and countries out there which are casting their greedy eyes on the North now because of its resources in terms of fossil fuels, fish and – probably – maritime transport possibilities. The European Union, because of its treaties and because of its raison d’être , is not in a position to strike the balance.</p>
      <p sl="en">One other point I would make is this: I am a member of the Delegation for relations with Canada, and we could also establish a collegial approach with Canada and like-minded countries to ensure fair play for the High North, and particularly the indigenous people.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the plundering of commodities, strategic interests, climate change and, not least, increasing tourism are driving this sensitive ecosystem to the brink of destruction. However, the ecosystem of the High North is relatively self-sustaining and therefore extremely sensitive. For this reason, it is important to strike a balance between exploitation, on the one hand, and maximum protection for this sensitive system, on the other. However, this cannot be achieved without imposing restrictions on the extraction of commodities and the methods used in this extraction, as well as stricter rules for tourism and commercial shipping.</p>
      <p sl="de">News that major mineral oil company BP and the Russian state-run enterprise Rosneft have drawn up joint plans for extracting oil and gas would not seem to point in the direction of the prudent extraction of commodities – quite the opposite in fact!</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore clear that the protection of the Arctic is an issue that goes beyond individual national strategic and economic interests and must be a central concern for the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gahler, and the shadow rapporteurs, for an excellent, diverse report, which raises various issues in a balanced way. These include the Arctic region’s potential, its vast natural resources, the raw materials and energy resources, and the new traffic lanes and tourism, but also, at the same time, the vulnerability of the delicate Arctic environment, and the rights of its indigenous peoples. In the north, we need to behave very responsibly indeed, and to have a good Arctic strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I also agree with my fellow Finnish Members who have expressed their satisfaction with the report, in that it has positively taken account of the initiative of the University of Lapland to establish an EU Arctic Information Centre on its premises. I look forward to the Commission’s report on Arctic policy, as promised by Mr Füle.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this has indeed been an interesting debate showing how many important subjects are covered by Arctic cooperation, and how varied are the sensitivities in our society when discussing the Arctic’s future. Let me address five specific issues raised in this morning’s discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the Arctic Information Centre. Both the Commission communication of 2008 and the Council conclusions of 2009 ask the Commission to explore the possibility of establishing a new Arctic Information Centre. We are thoroughly examining the various possibilities in the European Union, including the centre in Rovaniemi, Finland (Lapland) and, above all, the role of this possible centre.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the European Union is the only Arctic stakeholder to have recognised upfront that, as an industrialised entity, it is responsible, along with other industrialised areas, for the changes happening in the Arctic. The Commission communication gives priority to environmental protection, and the prominence of this point was maintained in the Council conclusions of 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we are proud of our Sami EU citizens, and we are proud of the different provisions in the EU treaties and in the EU regional policy addressing the Sami people. Our cross-border cooperation and European instrument for democracy and human rights programmes are supporting the Sami people of north-west Russia and other indigenous peoples of the Barents region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, the European Union and Member States are a leading force for Arctic research in the world, and we are proud of it. This area has been mentioned in the framework programme. Altogether, through the fifth, sixth and seventh framework programmes, the European Union is investing EUR 200 million in this field. However, trying to be the prominent and unilateral leader in overall Arctic politics and policies, while not being an Arctic coastal entity, will not be a wise policy to pursue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fifthly, the Commission adopted in 2010 a communication on offshore drilling, which should guide our actions across the world, including the Arctic region. It promotes a cautious approach that we will also apply in the Arctic. This is totally in line with the EU principles of protecting the Arctic and firmly asking for the highest environmental standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the Parliament’s High North report gives a comprehensive overview of the European Union’s activities, responsibilities and interests in the Arctic region. It also consolidates the EU’s balanced approach to the Arctic, combining its protection and its sustainable development. We are convinced that this is within our reach and that the European Union will become an unavoidable and positive reference for Arctic circumpolar cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would also like to thank all the speakers. Commissioner, when I referred to a policy in relation to our neighbours in the High North, I did not wish to imply that you were engaging in a dispute over authority with Baroness Ashton. I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Almost all the speeches we have heard have made one thing clear: the challenge confronting us is to demonstrate through our policy that different interests and activities are reconcilable or must be made reconcilable.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that this can be seen in microcosm in Norway, for example: they catch fish, they drill for oil and gas, they practise the highest environmental standards on land and sea and they develop their northernmost regions for the people who live there. If we can apply this principle to the region as a whole through cooperation with local communities, then we will become a role model for other sensitive regions. What has changed in the political reality is the fact that we do not believe that we can compel people to comply with our wishes, but that we must accept the challenge of achieving all our goals at the same time: we need a high standard in environmental protection, a clamp-down on climate change, a sustainable fisheries policy, secure shipping route development and acceptable development for local communities. If we try to work together to set these targets and then to achieve them, then we really will achieve something important in cooperation with our partners for the benefit of the region and ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once again, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in particular. I look forward to further debate on the basis of this report. The vote should not mark the end of this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, exactly three years ago, the European Parliament endorsed the Black Sea Synergy. This was the first step towards a coherent policy in one of the most sensitive areas in Europe, and it was a step in the right direction because the Black Sea is now widely analysed – and feared – as a converging space of political, strategic and security hopes, strengths and ambitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, our policy in the area can be further developed. This House can play a crucial role in upgrading EU policies to a fully-fledged EU strategy. This is actually the main idea in the report I initiated with the support of my colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Committee and Parliament as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">But why a new report on the Black Sea and why an EU strategy for the Black Sea? Some people would say that the Black Sea is a small sea. Indeed it is, but if we exchange this map for a strategy map, the Black Sea becomes huge. There is also another factor: the Black Sea is getting blacker and blacker.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea is now partially an internal EU sea. However, developments in the region are often unpredictable: tensions accumulate and misunderstandings abound. A summary analysis of the Black Sea region leads to the conclusion that the negative challenges in this area persist or are, indeed, gaining in intensity. The Georgia-Russia war of 2008, the unsolved and so-called ‘frozen’ conflicts, and the worrying deterioration of democratic rule in Ukraine and Russia are all very serious developments and vivid examples of the security risks in the area.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we examine the current results of EU involvement in the region, they seem at least mixed. The EU policy approach towards the Black Sea lacks mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation and follow-up. The Black Sea region is not visible enough in debates in Brussels, and EU funding for the region is fragmented and complicated.</p>
      <p sl="en">While building upon the merits of the Black Sea Synergy which we adopted three years ago, a new EU strategy for the Black Sea should put in place a stronger policy and concrete tools. Let me mention just two of the recommendations in the report. The first concerns adequate resources: if the EU wants to play a key role in the Black Sea region, it needs to devote adequate resources, both financial and human. The creation of a separate budget line in the EU budget is vital. The second recommendation is for the elaboration of an EU action plan with clear objectives and tasks, including regular ministerial-level meetings of the relevant countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU strategy for the Black Sea should not underestimate, or overestimate, any state in the area. The principles of inclusiveness and regional ownership should be reflected in an important role for Turkey and Russia, but also for all the regional partners, in the success of regional cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I should like to thank all my colleagues for their very positive contributions to the final version of this report. I think we all agree that this House expects the Commission and the Council to turn this report into reality. The strategic and beneficial involvement of the EU in the Black Sea region should become a fact.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very glad that the Black Sea region is high on the agenda of the European Parliament. This region is important for the European Union and we need to focus on it to reflect its extreme sensitivity for us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Traian Ungureanu, on an excellent and very substantive report. The report and its recommendations are interesting and innovative on the many issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the latest enlargement, the Black Sea is also an EU sea. We have responsibilities towards it, just as we do to all other basin regions that border us. We have to tackle this new responsibility resolutely.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, we already have an initiative targeting this region: the Black Sea Synergy. However, we must admit that its implementation has proved much more difficult than we had thought. Not everything we want to do is being welcomed with enthusiasm by everybody in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Precisely for these reasons, Parliament has chosen an approach based on regional ownership and fostering dialogue. I believe that this is now the right approach for us to pursue, but these commitments can only be credible if and when they bring concrete improvements to the peoples in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, the report on developing a new European Union strategy for the Black Sea represents our commitment to the region and to our Member States who belong to this area by giving them our full support in facing the challenges linked to their specific geographic situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We understand that a strategy for the Black Sea region should not be interpreted as a replacement for existing efforts, particularly the Black Sea Synergy. It should rather be a comprehensive framework where guidance can be found for all European Union activities in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Black Sea strategy can provide an ideal occasion to review our interests in the region, including strategic, political and economic interests, and to discuss how best they can be achieved. Parliament has identified the appropriate fields in which the strategy should be developed, like governance, security and energy, transport, environment, trade, local economic development and social and human development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Developing this strategy can also provide the opportunity to add a maritime dimension to ongoing activities in the region. The Commission is currently developing a comprehensive package that will address maritime policy initiatives, management of natural resources and the fight against illegal fishing activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can draw on our know-how from other strategies, such as the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the EU Danube strategy. Indeed, the Danube strategy will require obvious interactions with the Black Sea. However, we are aware that each European basin region is different. Accordingly, we need to ensure that all future EU strategies should be adapted to their own sectoral characteristics, economic and social development, environment and energy, infrastructure and natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report on developing an EU strategy for the Black Sea region offers an overview of the future challenges for the region, but it will also be relevant for establishing solid channels with the state partners in the region to ensure its smooth and effective implementation. We need to use this opportunity to consult extensively with all stakeholders, starting with our partners in the regions and with the involvement of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again, this report is welcome and we are keen to draw on its recommendations. The External Action Service and the relevant Commission services will be committing their efforts to prepare a Black Sea strategy for which we will seek your and the Council’s support.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I am pleased that, as has already been mentioned, after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, the Black Sea, to put it figuratively, became a ‘European’ sea and requires an overall European strategy involving quite a lot of administrative and financial resources, as well as good coordination and accountability.</p>
      <p sl="bg">A key task is to incorporate a project approach into the new strategy. Special attention has to be paid to areas of common interest, such as the environment, energy, transport and infrastructure, which are of decisive importance to the region’s sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Intensive cooperation at parliamentary level is also necessary, for example, with organisations such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the WTO, and with the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank. Finally, I also believe that we should consider other regional initiatives, but not allow the strategy to drown in them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We stress the European added value and importance of the Southern Gas Corridor as a means of enhancing the European Union’s supply security. Projects such as the Nabucco pipeline, a priority project for the European Union, along with the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, the Pan-European Oil Pipeline, the Turkey-Greece-Italy Interconnector, or the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Romania Interconnector, emphasise both the importance of the EU’s commitments in the Black Sea region and the further need to step up cooperation between the countries in the region.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, the importance of the Black Sea region for the EU from the transport, energy, stability, security and environmental point of view is evident. It is for this reason that the EU strategy for this region will certainly have a very positive impact on the area and on the EU as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Committee on Regional Development believes this strategy can bring growth and sustainable development for the region. But also it is of the opinion that for full effectiveness, it is necessary to involve all the states of the region, no matter whether they are Member States or not. This strategy needs actions to be coordinated – but how could this coordination exist without the proper involvement of all countries? Coordination is certainly needed with the Danube strategy, which is soon supposed to become a major priority of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The use of an integrated approach and cross-border cooperation between the regions should be promoted in all fields of the strategy but, in particular, those of transport, energy and the environment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done, bringing many ideas together in a comprehensive form, something that will help us in our future efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must understand that this cooperation in the Black Sea region should not be confused with the Eastern Partnership or with our strategic relations with Turkey and Russia. These are different matters and this cooperation does not replace them. On the other hand, I find hugely exciting that it is possible to bring these divergent groups together on certain issues in order to produce a coherent policy that is in our own interests, as well as helping the relevant countries too. Such cooperation may possibly help to bring together conflicting political and economic interests, so that future disputes will be less dramatic and dangerous and so that, for example, our work in the Eastern Partnership is not construed as being directed against any particular individual, but rather that everything is understood to be complementary. However, when it comes to a European perspective, this cooperative stance should not preclude us from expecting that the Eastern Partnership with these countries will produce different results from development strategies with Russia, for example. We must be permitted to make such distinctions and the Commissioner is no doubt well aware that this should be the case. However, for this reason, Black Sea cooperation is in the interest of the European Union, in the interest of Russia, in the interest of Turkey and in the interest of the remaining countries in this region – most of whom are members of the Eastern Partnership. I could imagine that this will contribute significantly to the economic and political stability of Europe and hope that we can work closely with the Commissioner in order to drive this forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Black Sea is a gate to and from Europe, and therefore it should be addressed as such. It is not a far distant place of little relevance which occasionally comes to our attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The truth is that the area has already put – and will continue to put – items on our agenda, be it through the interruption of gas transit as in 2006 and 2008, or the Georgian war in 2008. However, in spite of the evidence and its recognised importance, the Black Sea area still does not enjoy the attention it deserves from the EU – an EU which was, in a way, compelled to address these problems once Bulgaria and Romania had become members in 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Black Sea Synergy, elaborated not long after the admission of those two countries, appears to have been, in retrospect, a hastily put together document designed to cover a ‘blank spot’ or ‘black hole’ – depending on your preference – which the EU had to deal with almost overnight. The fact that nothing of importance has happened since the first review of the initiative in 2008 – and we are not very far advanced in its implementation as mentioned in the report – is indicative of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">To my mind, there are two main reasons for this. First, there is an apparent disinterest and unwillingness on the part of EU Members to address the area decisively. Moreover, now that money is short, there is even less willingness to do so than before.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the initial assumption on which the synergy was based, namely, that the area should become a coherent and cooperative region in order to qualify for EU attention and material support, has ignored the simple truth that just 20 years ago, the area looked completely different. To expect an area so complex and different to become coherent and get an individual identity in such a short time is either unrealistic or – I hate to say – ill-intended. Perhaps, in the context of a revisiting of the Eastern Partnership, things would improve.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, the report which my fellow Member, Mr Ungureanu, has prepared in such a committed way and in a manner that paves the way for cooperation, for which I thank him, brings our attention back to a region characterised by diversity. The diversity of political systems, cultural traditions, religions, statuses and ambitions in terms of moving closer to the European Union, the level of economic development, the availability of natural resources and, of course, the new situation which has arisen because, today, three Member States of the European Union form part of the region that we are discussing.</p>
      <p sl="sl">For us, the Black Sea region is particularly interesting because of its geostrategic position, which brings with it either added value or serious risks to our security interests. In this context, I emphasise, in particular, energy security and ensuring a sustainable energy supply for the European Union, infrastructure and opportunities for us to have an influence in the resolution of conflicts and unresolved issues in the region, as well as developing partnerships with Russia and Turkey. All of this can be achieved with a deeper engagement of the countries in the region and with the participation of all Member States of the European Union and other organisations and networks present in the region, including networks of civil society organisations; it is precisely they that require our special attention and recognition.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We do not need new institutions for any of this; what we need to do is ensure regular funding and greater political engagement. Commissioner, I believe that you will be able to put this report to good use and I look forward to working with you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the Black Sea region is to develop into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity and if these opportunities and challenges are to be fulfilled, we need an all-embracing strategy. This resolution pursues that objective and is therefore supported by my group. This is also because a number of our proposals have been included, for example, dealing with the unresolved conflicts in the region, improving cooperation in civil society, support for people-to-people projects and the promotion of small projects in the context of cross-border cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also want to see a sustainable energy policy, greater energy efficiency and the establishment of academic and student networks. However, what I would criticise is the lack of a coherent position in relation to the question of the energy infrastructure in the region – I would mention Nabucco and South Stream in this context. I fail to understand why our call for stricter monitoring of oil rigs in the Black Sea has been rejected. This is absolutely essential following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

I would like to emphasise that the Black Sea Synergy needs rethinking, today. Noble intentions have not always translated into effective use of the Synergy, and it is very good that the rapporteur stresses this. Therefore, I think the most important task today for Mr Füle is to try to sort out our initiatives in this part of Europe and show that our priority is Neighbourhood Policy, and that other issues should be given second place in this context. I think this way of thinking guarantees that the Black Sea Synergy will be effective in the future, especially in the field of energy. The Synergy could also be a good instrument, for example, if we are talking about supporting Georgia in the democratic and economic transformations it has been going through in recent years. However, the first and essential step, today, is to organise initiatives in this part of Europe, so that we can not only be proud of them, but that they will really be effective in achieving some specific objectives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Then there is Turkey which the EU is playing with by offering membership despite the reality that members such as France will veto an application. Turkey has just 4% of its landmass within Europe. It should not be in the EU. There are real dangers in leading Turkey on. Disappointment could drive Turkey into the hands of Islamic extremists.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, underlying all of this is the fact that the Black Sea is the hub for vital Caspian oil and gas. Tread carefully indeed.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, I would like to join the majority of the opinions expressed in this House and congratulate the rapporteur on what he has achieved with his report. Pontus Euxinus , as the Black Sea was called in antiquity, has always been of a major geostrategic and economic significance for Europe. It still has this significance in our times.</p>
      <p sl="bg">That is why it is very important for this strategy to be translated into real action, because we are having a debate again, and I remember us having a similar debate quite recently. That is why I want to basically draw a line under what has been said by the members of the socialist group, and to lend my particular support for the point that envisages a separate budgetary item to implement the strategy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Ungureanu on his initiative in carrying out the report on the Black Sea. I also welcome the endorsement of several of the previous speakers, my distinguished colleagues, who have committed themselves to promoting a new European vision for the Black Sea region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Black Sea has indeed become a partially internal sea of the European Union. Its geostrategic importance can hardly be overstated, considering the regional stability, the democratisation processes, and the related energy security, economic and commercial issues. I strongly believe that we, the EU, should benefit from the potential of the Black Sea region and not others.</p>
      <p sl="en">To achieve this goal, the European Union has to rely more on its Member States belonging to the region, has to give up any anchorage in the past and has to show more dynamism, leadership and vision. Without touching on the issues related to the enlargement process, I would like to address a message to all the Black Sea sceptics. Any slowdown in the EU integration process of the region will have a throwback effect on the democratic evolution of the area. The risk is medium and long-term instability, whose implications would be hard to evaluate, and even harder to manage, for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the EU needs its internal Black Sea and we need an integrated strategy for this region. The Black Sea strategy should be drafted by the Commission, relying on the recommendations reached by our rapporteur. Today, this House should offer its wholehearted support for the strategy.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we are debating a very important report today on a particular area close to the European Union: the Black Sea. The area combines EU Member States and countries which are important to regional cooperation. We therefore have a common need to safeguard the existence of an area of peace, democracy, security and stability around the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have a stable framework for cooperation through the Black Sea Synergy, which was put in motion some time ago, although not with tangible results. Its successful implementation through action by all participating countries will further strengthen our relations on the basis of common values. It needs to complement the established European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership.</p>
      <p sl="el">Stability and security around the Black Sea have a direct impact on Europe. Consequently, the European Union shares responsibility for supporting the peaceful resolution of conflict and building confidence. This area is important to the Union, especially by reason of its energy and transport links. Strengthening democracy and a strong rule of law system will facilitate trade, investments and the free movement of people.</p>
      <p sl="el">I absolutely endorse the view that a special line should be set up in the budget for the Black Sea Synergy. This will provide effective help in modernising the area. It is up to us to use our policies to bring these countries even closer to Europe, for the mutual benefit of all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, since 2007, we have acknowledged the importance of the Black Sea region, yet the impact of our approach has been modest to say the least: no concrete projects, no concrete results. We need a realistic and financially sound action plan with clear objectives, priority actions and benchmarks, and a better division of tasks and coordination with the Eastern Partnership and the Danube strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to launch the energy and transport partnership alongside the environment partnership. Only through such a project-based approach, focused on small-scale specific projects, can we overcome the issue of the very diverse and complex interests in the region. We need to get past our fragmented approach in terms of finance as well. So far, we have had various financial instruments and little visibility. That is why we should make the Black Sea joint operational programme our central instrument for implementing the Black Sea strategy, using it as seed money to attract institutions ready to invest in the region and, hence, promote cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, the slow tempo of project implementation, the non-existence of action plans and assessment reports, the absence of high-level meetings, the risk of duplicity with the Eastern Partnership and many other problems indicate that the decision for Member States to take a leading role in implementing the Black Sea strategy was ill-advised. It appears that the European Commission should play a more significant role as the secretariat and facilitator of this strategy for the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I also firmly believe that this strategy, just like the other macro-region strategies, should remain neutral in budgetary, institutional and legislative terms; in other words, that it should not involve the expenditure of further additional resources, the establishment of new institutions or the drafting of new legislation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There is no need for new operational programmes and specific budgetary items, but there is a need to focus on implementing specific projects, in which the states affected will have a real interest.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, it is merely a formality nowadays to emphasise that the Black Sea is an area of strategic importance to the European Union. How could it be otherwise, now that, following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, it is practically an internal sea within the European Union? Energy, security, stability and, of course, democracy are sectors of prime importance to us in this area.</p>
      <p sl="el">Since 2007, when we started our policy in this area, which is crucial on several counts, we have made some progress and achieved some successes. However, unfortunately, we have also seen delays and fragmented approaches and periods of inertia. It is unfortunate that no ministerial meeting on this policy has been organised since 2008. This situation falls well below our initial ambitions and, given the geostrategic, geopolitical and economic importance of the area, we only have one choice: to strengthen our policy and action on the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">I therefore unreservedly support the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Ungureanu, to upgrade European policy on the Black Sea to an integrated strategy supported by a separate budget line. Within this framework, I wish, as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to highlight the importance of these two sectors, which must be constituent components of a European strategy for the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, there is no need to emphasise that the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy could also make an essential contribution to uniform, viable development of the Black Sea area. This needs to be done now. However, enlargement is another matter and requires a great deal of careful study.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea region became an EU neighbouring region. It is a strategic bridge connecting Europe with the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. Its geopolitical and economic importance for the EU is constantly increasing in terms of security, stability and energy. The Union should therefore step up its presence, develop active policies and find lasting solutions to the existing problems in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not only the littoral countries that show a big interest in multilateral regional cooperation – which is crucial for solving urgent issues of regional and European importance such as ‘frozen’ conflicts, trafficking and other security-related issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is currently needed is a focus on several issues of concern that are of pragmatic interest to all the littoral states. One such issue is maritime security. In recent years, there has been an increase in accidents involving loss of human life and environmental damage in the Black Sea. The EU should reduce the risk of civil accidents by providing assistance to search-and-rescue operations within the framework of the European integrated maritime policy. We expect to vote soon on the report by our colleague, Iliana Malinova Iotova, which deals for the first time with EU fisheries policy in the Black Sea. This could also offer a good basis for multilateral cooperation in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU support is also desirable for ongoing projects like the Black Sea Ring Highway, Pan-European Transport Corridors 8 and 9, and the transport connections between the Black Sea ports.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, when we are talking about the Black Sea region, it needs to be said that there is no place like it around the European Union where there are such extreme differences, so many intense conflicts – including bloody conflicts – and so many conflicting interests. So we should not delude ourselves that by formulating any kind of policy, we will be able to resolve matters which other policies cannot resolve. This is not a radio request show, and we cannot solve energy problems when Russia does not want the pipeline but we do want it. We cannot resolve regional conflicts, either. In fact, it is a very limited policy, but for all that, it is worth applying it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Since we are talking about synergy in relation to Black Sea policy, we should bear in mind that synergy means a certain added value. I would like to ask, for example, why the European Parliament is not working with organisations which exist in the region, such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (PABSEC). They want to work with us. The European Parliament thinks it is too big and too important, and is not seeking this cooperation. I propose we begin this cooperation and act together with others.</p>

No action plan has been drawn up for the Black Sea Synergy and funding is provided via several uncoordinated instruments. This makes it imperative to devise an EU Black Sea strategy, with the same level of priority as the European Union’s other regional strategies and focused on three main areas: economic, social and human development; energy, transport and environment; security and good governance.</p>

Commissioner, there is the major issue of the Nabucco pipeline, on which the energy security of Europe depends in large measure.

Yesterday, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, told us that he had been in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan and that discussions had gone very well. What does that mean? At some point, we need to set a time limit. When will we know whether or not the Nabucco pipeline is viable, so that we do not waste energy and can look for alternatives?

      <p sl="ro">Given that, up until now, the actions taken by the EU have not been clarified sufficiently and the Black Sea Synergy has not achieved its expected potential, I sincerely hope that the European External Action Service will have available the human and material resources required to complete the implementation of the three partnerships: environment, transport and energy.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Hungarian Member, I add my thoughts to the strategy for the Black Sea because I seem to notice two goals in the report which are identical with the main priorities of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The first one is the fact that the report makes a commitment to regional development between the European Union and this region. For us Hungarian Members, this is particularly important with a view to support for the Danube strategy, as any request for support for the Danube strategy can only be credible if we remain open to supporting other strategies as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The second one is energy security itself. Other than its intention to ensure peace and stability in the region, perhaps the most important objective of the strategy for the Black Sea in the field of energy security is to ensure energy security itself, and as was said yesterday, energy security is the other main priority of the Hungarian Presidency, and is thus in all our interests.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the Black Sea is on our doorstep and, when looked at from the energy perspective, it is also genuinely European.

The Black Sea offers a great opportunity. What is key in this respect is cooperation. We have just talked about the investments around Nabucco; these things can work only with stable relations.

      <p sl="ro">I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague, Traian Ungureanu, for drafting this report, which is especially important to Romania. My country is the most active EU Member State in promoting the Black Sea’s strategic importance and the need for the Union to increase its role in this region. The region’s importance has been outlined in several instruments supporting the EU’s eastern neighbours. However, the Black Sea Synergy has produced limited results. I think that the EU’s priorities must be aimed at consolidating a stable, democratic region. Unresolved conflicts have become the sore point in the Black Sea region. They can reignite at any time, posing a threat to regional security. The Black Sea is also of particular importance to EU energy security. The European Commission must continue to focus, in particular, on planned energy projects in this region.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The confused objectives and duplication of forms of cooperation are at risk of depriving the EU’s Black Sea strategy of any substance. The situation is unlikely to improve due to the differences in status of the countries involved in relation to the European Union, to the frequently differing interests of the actors involved in this cooperation and due to a lack of vision, which is also evident in the Ungureanu report. If we want to speed up the process of settling the unresolved conflicts in the region, we need to start from the observation that this action has been greatly delayed by sponsors of the various plans vying with each other, thereby holding the process up for more than 15 years. Indeed, this competition betrays their varying interests, most often linked, whether explicitly or implicitly, to control over the transport routes in the region. I believe that a clearer picture will emerge only when it is patently obvious what is going to happen with Turkey’s accession to the EU and what status Russia will have in relation to the Union. It is only when these matters have been clarified that the unresolved conflicts will be settled and long-term stability established in the region.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The strategy for the Black Sea is expected to play an increasingly important part in the future of the European Union. This is illustrated quite well by the joint declaration signed by the European Commission and Azerbaijan last week, in which Azerbaijan made a written commitment to making a large quantity of gas sources available to Europe. I am pleased to note that the European Commission is finally taking concrete steps to promote the Nabucco project, because ensuring access to the sources of gas located in the Caspian region should be considered a special priority. Meanwhile, however, we must not forget about the transportation of gas to Europe, which can only be realised through the countries of the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The intensification of dialogue between the EU and the countries of the Black Sea could represent a major advancement in guaranteeing the security of European energy supply as the construction of the Nabucco pipeline will also provide Member States currently characterised by a very poor diversity of resources with access to new sources of gas. However, the establishment of the pipelines will also require active contribution on the part of the countries involved. A transparent, non-discriminatory transport framework and a business environment that supports investments are not only important for the supply security of EU Member States, but are also crucial for the stability and prosperity of the region. In my opinion, the Black Sea region can only benefit from the construction of Nabucco: the pipeline will provide a predictable source of income for countries in the region, and will, at the same time, provide them with direct access to the world’s largest gas market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The author of the report under discussion clearly indicates that what is called the Black Sea Synergy, which was adopted in 2007, has not completely fulfilled the hopes which were placed in it. The enlargement of the Union with Bulgaria and Romania meant that this region found itself at the centre of our attention. After the situation in Central and Eastern Europe had stabilised, it seemed the time had come for the Union to concentrate on the Black Sea region. However, the global economic crisis made this subject literally disappear from the European agenda. We must not forget that the Union is not only the Baltic or the Mediterranean basin. Of course, current events in Tunisia show that these regions, too, require our attention. However, we must start to realise that the Black Sea region is slowly becoming pivotal from the European point of view. It is there that the solution to our energy problems is to be found. It is there that communication routes are located which are important to our economy. It is there that sources of instability, too, are to be found, which may, for us, represent a significant danger. For all these reasons, it is necessary to agree with the rapporteur that the time has come to develop a comprehensive EU policy for the Black Sea region. What is more, it seems that changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon may contribute to the effective introduction of such a plan. Furthermore, the establishment of a suitable unit in the European External Action Service could solve most of the imperfections of the current Black Sea Synergy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The European Union strategy for the Black Sea region resembles a yeti. Everyone talks about it, but no one has seen it. This belief of mine is strengthened by some of the contradictions I can see right at the beginning of the resolution. First, there is the definition of the Black Sea region. It is rather curious that Azerbaijan, a country on the Caspian Sea, is included, while Macedonia is not, although its two closest neighbours, Bulgaria and Greece, are included in the Black Sea region, ‘in accordance with the European Commission definition’. I had no idea that Greece stretches all the way to the shores of the Black Sea. The 13 areas of cooperation where greater EU involvement is anticipated in the region comprise a very extensive list. It seems that the Commission did not previously appreciate the importance of this region. Ultimately, given that EUR 1.5 million was taken from a pilot project on the environment and the development of the region in the spring of this year and redirected to a project on bananas in the ACP countries, I would have to query the information on which the Commission based such a decision. It is curious that the author ‘failed to notice’ the South Stream gas pipeline, yet mentions the controversial and not fully funded Nabucco project. I would like to emphasise that the opportunity to enter into partnership relationships with various EU regions will be very important for the further development of the region, excluding the area mentioned before. The conclusions from the last debate on suspending visas with Ukraine are missing.</p>

The accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU has brought added value with the provision of access to the Black Sea, a region which also brings together countries neighbouring the Union, including strategic partners. Drawing up a common Black Sea strategy will enable us to make significant progress towards creating an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity. In this context, we can regard the common, integrated initiatives adopted by the countries in the region as a preliminary step towards the reunification of our continent.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As both a Romanian and a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I support the link being made between the future Black Sea strategy and the Danube strategy, recently launched by the European Commission. I think that the EU needs to be involved more in the Black Sea region and to cooperate with third countries, as our regions are interlinked territorially and economically. This will enable us to ensure greater energy security for the future, by implementing infrastructure projects such as the Southern Corridor or liquefied gas terminals and diversifying supply routes and sources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, we must give due importance to coordinating the financial instruments available for the Black Sea region, develop and modernise its ports, and reduce pollution in this area.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Black Sea Synergy is a further example of a missed opportunity in the area of relations with regions which are geopolitically and strategically important for its future. When the strategy was adopted, construction of energy interconnections between the Black Sea countries and the European Union was set as a priority. The main investment which will enable achievement of this objective is the Nabucco gas pipeline. Unfortunately, we have, for a long time, been seeing a lack of determination from Brussels on this. Neighbouring countries which are interested in the construction of the pipeline are also saying so. For a year now, Azerbaijan has been signalling the need for action from the Union in order to contract gas from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, because without their involvement, construction of the pipeline will not be financially worthwhile. Meanwhile, a competing project which by-passes the Caucasus countries – the Russian South Stream pipeline – is being given tacit consent for its construction. We must not work like this. The provisions of the energy report are insufficient. They should be made more specific by the addition of information about the means earmarked for investments of strategic significance for the future of the EU.</p>

In 1991 in Lithuania, an unarmed crowd of several thousand people resisted the aggression of the Soviet army and defended freedom and independence. The bloody events of the night of 13 January stunned Europe and the whole world. Countries, international organisations and individuals reacted to the violence of the occupying forces, sending messages of support to Vilnius. On behalf of all the people of Lithuania, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the resolution adopted on 24 January 1991, supporting the Baltic States, and condemning Soviet aggression.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to express my views on the agreement that the EU has entered into today with Libya, with regard to which I have to say that there is one thing that is seriously lacking. It is strange to see that what is probably the most important element as far as Europeans are concerned is completely absent from this report, namely, the fact that illegal immigrants make enormous use of Libya as a transit country for entering Europe from all over Africa and from Asia, in other words, from large parts of the world. It is well-known that the EU is a magical land where the streets are flowing with riches and honey. It is therefore a huge magnet for an incredible number of people wanting to escape from the prison, poverty and misery that their own countries represent. It is also clear that the very fact that Libya, along with other North African countries, is patently used as a transit country is an enormous challenge for us in the EU. This ought to have played a much greater role in the discussions we had with the Libyan authorities – a much greater role with regard to the requirements we are imposing to prevent this pressure on Europe’s borders. It is good that we have initiated talks, but it is frustrating that the talks are not permitted to deal with what is important.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic feeling still exists to one degree or another in many parts of the world today, as do hostility and ill feeling towards Christians.</p>
      <p sl="it">The events that have taken place recently, including violent attacks against Christians living in Pakistan, Iraq, Egypt, Nigeria and Cyprus, must be condemned in the strongest terms. A mutual understanding of other people’s values is the very cornerstone of religious freedom, and it must not be restricted in such a serious way. People’s fundamental freedoms must therefore be safeguarded, whether they are Christian or of other faiths.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, the European Union cannot and must not waste substantial resources on promoting other religions, particularly at this time of economic crisis. The Commission has spent an incredible EUR 4 million on promoting Islam. These funds could probably have been used for other important purposes.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what we have approved today is fundamental. Religious freedom is the mother of all freedoms. It is one of our fundamental, inalienable human rights and is included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">These rights include freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others, and in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. However, the massacres of recent months that have claimed victims from among the Christian minorities are the culmination of an offensive that is being conducted against Christians in many parts of the world with a systematic and indiscriminate degree of violence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, as these events show, the right to religious freedom is today being called into question. This is creating intolerance, which is often encouraged and manipulated for political and financial ends. What is most striking in this current climate is the fact that the institutions are saying nothing. Any quiet protests are easily silenced.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I share the concerns and views expressed by previous speakers. However, there is one particular aspect that has, in fact, been given far too little attention in this report. This is paragraph 7, which concerns the condemnation of the way in which the Turkish authorities are behaving in Northern Cyprus, which, according to all international rules, is unlawfully occupied by Turkey – by Turkish troops – and therefore by a country that is both formally and, in reality, negotiating its accession to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="da">We are seeing how the Greek-Cypriot inhabitants who want to return to their churches, monasteries and sacred buildings in Northern Cyprus are being hampered when they want to come back, how they are being prevented from entering and simply restoring their churches and how they are being prevented from coming back and reclaiming the property that is rightfully theirs.</p>
      <p sl="da">What we are actually witnessing in Northern Cyprus is the violent discrimination against, and suppression of, Christians, with the direct support of an EU candidate country, namely Turkey. That is unacceptable, and the European Parliament should therefore act in a way that is consistent with paragraph 7 and recommend that the negotiations with Turkey be stopped, at least until there is order in Northern Cyprus.</p>

We cannot stand idly by in the face of such events. The issue of religious freedom, as well as other civil liberties, continues to be a priority of the European Parliament’s work. This is why I fully endorse the statement made by the President of the European Parliament, Mr Buzek, in which he condemns these crimes. I appeal, too, to the European Union to take all available diplomatic steps in order to secure religious liberties for minorities, particularly in countries whose citizens violate these rights. In the report on human rights in 2009 which was adopted recently, we emphasised the need for the Union to play an active role in efforts to improve human rights and democracy around the world. We called for the appointment of a special EU representative on human rights. Today’s resolution is the perfect starting point for the next stage of our fight for these rights to be respected.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, religious freedom is the basis of civilisation. Without it, democracy is crippled and society is forced into a belief that denies humanity and human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is what is happening in various parts of the world. Extremist and fundamentalist beliefs are triggering deadly acts of violence against Christians, who are becoming true modern martyrs. The intolerance that is giving rise to this violence is generated by a fundamentalist culture. This is why any manifestation that denies other people’s religious or cultural identity must be immediately and unfailingly condemned. The international community and its institutions have a duty to safeguard respect for religious faith. They have not always taken swift action when Christians have been the victims of massacres.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Chaldeans in Iraq and the Copts in Egypt are in danger of disappearing from regions in which they have lived for centuries.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, voted in favour of this resolution, because the issue of protecting religious minorities around the world is now more crucial than ever.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is extremely worrying that in 2011, people are still being persecuted for their beliefs. Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union leaves no room for interpretation. It clearly lays down the right to full freedom of thought, conscience and religion. The attacks against certain religious communities that have taken place over the last few weeks are yet another indication of the urgent need for all governments to adopt effective measures to protect religious minorities, whatever the difficulties or threats.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union’s aim must be to foster inter-faith dialogue through greater cooperation between countries in Europe, but especially in countries where religious freedom is unfortunately not yet guaranteed. The right to religious freedom must be respected and guaranteed everywhere, without exception.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this is an historic, excellent resolution. We need to focus attention on freedom of religion in Europe. It is important for us to remember our roots, which are to be found in Judaeo-Christian values. Fundamental European values and rights are built on this heritage – on these roots. Perhaps what happened to the Coptic Christians in Egypt made us sit up and take note. Christians need protection in different parts of the world, and not just in Egypt: similar things have taken place in Turkey and Assyria.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We Europeans should also take a particular interest in the fact that there are situations in the European Union in which we should intervene. People are becoming victims of persecution because of their religion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This, in turn, is due to a misplaced fear of Islam. We have forsaken our values and therefore trampled on Christian values at its expense. We should not act in this way; instead, we need dialogue and freedom of religion.

      <p sl="nl">There again, in recital N, it is stated that Europe is not completely innocent when it comes to violation of freedom of religion. That may well be the case but, by saying that, we are putting occasional and isolated problems in Europe in the same category as structural discrimination of, and attacks against, Christians in Muslim countries. Besides, this is not just about bomb attacks and other forms of physical violence committed by Muslim extremists; in many Muslim countries, there is also an official policy that is directed against Christians. Just take the supposed unavailability of resources for renovating Christian churches in Turkey, or the difficulties surrounding the succession of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.

Look at it from the point of view of a former Soviet apparatchik analysing the European Union. I put it to you that he might find a few things that would make him feel rather at home. He would see that we are governed not by an elected president or an elected system, but by a 27-member Politburo called the European Commission, he would look and see this rubber-stamp Parliament that would make him feel a little nostalgic, he would see the series of five-year plans by which we administer our affairs, he would even see the fleet of special limousines and even special reserve shops for employees of the system and members of the nomenklatura.</p>
      <p sl="en">Above all, he would see what Engels called ‘the doctrine of false consciousness’ – that when people vote, they do not understand their true interest and it is for us to impose a better system on them. I am reminded of that terrifying closing scene of Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ where the animals look from man to pig and pig to man and find that they cannot tell which is which.</p>

In my opinion, the European Union should be particularly vigilant regarding the human rights violations that occur in its neighbouring regions. I would have liked to see more regarding the problems faced by youth. Youth organisations in Belarus are not allowed to act freely; instead, they have to go underground.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For more than a year now, young people in Europe have been in the habit of organising street events where they have gagged important statues in European capitals, because they are mute.

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the resolution tabled. We believe that it will be an important signal both to the Belarusian authorities and to civil society, the media and everyone fighting for the country’s democratic development. We hope that the measures proposed in the resolution will be given careful consideration and be discussed by the Commission and the Council, and will be implemented as fast as possible to have an effect.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In fact, the inauguration ceremony for the re-elected President Lukashenko scheduled for tomorrow will not stop the issues that have been raised about him, the legality of the elections and the way in which the results in these elections were recorded. Up to now, the European Union has used various policies and mechanisms to influence Belarus and the Belarus leadership, with modest results. Perhaps it is time to consider new options or whether we do not have a new situation in the region which will allow us to apply other mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Something that was alluded to in the resolution, which we consider extremely important and which has not been tried so far, is coordinating our policy and relations with Belarus with its immediate non-EU neighbours, that is to say, Russia, which is our strategic partner, and Ukraine, which is part of the Eastern Partnership. I think that through joint and coordinated efforts, we could achieve, if nothing else, at least an environment which would be politically more conducive to fair and democratic parliamentary elections, elections which are scheduled for next year.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The European Parliament also has to make fullest use of the options that are there. Today, we decided to send a delegation to Belarus, and I believe that allowing this delegation to visit the country and giving it the necessary assistance and contacts will be a test for the Belarus leadership. It will also allow us to get a clear idea and to see for ourselves the options the situation there holds.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my indignation at Mr Hannan’s comparing Belarus to the European Union. His nonsensical statement was all the more unpleasant because it was applauded by some of my fellow Members from Poland among the European Conservatives and Reformists.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Lukashenko regime should be isolated. The current policy of believing that the regime will gradually become open to democracy has turned out to be a miscalculation. The sanctions which should be imposed on Lukashenko’s regime should be harsh, for among other reasons, that it is a country which is an immediate neighbour of Europe. In relation to such countries, we should expect the same standards as for the Member States of the European Union. In particular, I would like the European Commission to support independent media such as TV Belsat, Radio Racyja and others. They are important for spreading information so that it reaches the citizens of Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the events in Belarus associated with the presidential elections have once again shaken public opinion in Europe. After a period of relative calm, President Lukashenko is again using force against opposition activists. He has turned again to the most shameful features of his dictatorship. The brutal clash with the participants of a peaceful demonstration and the arrest of opposition leaders and opposition candidates in the elections is a clear violation of human rights and signifies the abandonment of measures intended to improve relations with the democratic countries of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, I endorse in full Parliament’s resolution calling for the immediate release of political prisoners and for the elections to be repeated. I strongly condemn the dictatorial practices of President Lukashenko’s regime. I believe that pressure from European institutions will help ease the repression of Belarusian citizens. I also endorse all measures which support the development of civil society by relaxing visa policy, awarding grants to students and academic staff, and providing funding for independent organisations and media.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, there is no doubt that Belarus is something of a headache for Europe, and it is right that we should take every opportunity to criticise the regime as – fortunately – the last Communist dictatorship. We have a saying in Denmark that those who live in glasshouses should not throw stones, and therefore it is perhaps worth taking a look at what the EU looks like from the point of view of Belarus. Well, the EU is governed by a Commission made up of officials with absolutely no popular mandate, and it is only this Commission, made up of people with no popular movement behind them, no one to report to and no mandate from the citizens, that can table proposals. Once those proposals have been put forward and adopted, who is it who, with enormous political influence, ultimately decides how the EU legislation is to be implemented in the Member States? Again, it is people who have not been democratically elected, it is judges who sit at a nice comfortable distance from reality. The same can be said about this Parliament, where the vast majority are very comfortable inside the glass palaces where they have been placed, with no one to answer to at all and no understanding of the enormous concerns, opposition and agitation there is among the European citizens. If we look at the EU from Belarus’s point of view, we may see many frightening similarities to the dictatorships that we are trying to fight against.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I endorsed the resolution, being aware of the fact that the situation in Belarus is a very specific one. We are facing a fierce intensification of repression directed against human rights defenders. On the other hand, there is a sense in which this is happening as a result of the very thoughtless policy of some of the European Union’s Member States, because it is certain that it was absolutely unnecessary to lend credibility to Mr Lukashenko in the eyes of Europe and the European Union as has been done by Mr Berlusconi, who has visited Belarus, the President of Lithuania, Mrs Grybauskaitė, and the foreign ministers of Germany and Poland. We need to fight, today, for civil liberties in Belarus, although we should do this while trying to avoid pushing Belarus into the arms of Russia, because this, too, is very important.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, experience from a number of Member States shows that, six years after Council Regulation No 1/2003, there had still been no positive movement over the consistent application of competition rules.</p>
      <p sl="sk">When deciding on disputes, national courts are not making use of the possibility of requesting information or an opinion on a given case from the European Commission, nor are they making use of the right to turn to the European Court of Justice with a preliminary question, and nor is the Commission making use of the right to intervene as an amicus curiae . Practice points to considerable problems with judicial application in this area, including major deviations from the settled case-law of the European courts. I have therefore called on the Commission to pay attention to the decisions of the national courts, and to take the measures necessary for achieving this objective. This call has been written into the Report on Competition Policy, and I have supported the final text of the report.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, there is no doubt that European competitiveness is under considerable pressure. We have to question whether there really is a will among the Member States to do something about this. One thing is clear, however, and that is that we have created a currency, a common currency, that is proving disastrous for the economy in the whole of southern Europe. One reason for this is that the majority of those countries cannot keep up and have completely failed to implement the reforms that are necessary if we are to cope with future competition with China, India, South America and others. However, even in those areas that we would like to regard as areas of low-hanging fruit, as easy areas, it is impossible to reach agreement. One example is a clear initiative like the common European patent. It is appalling that, in this area, which is simply a matter of technicalities, we have not once been able to reach agreement. This is an example of how ineffective the EU is. In an area that could so easily be so beneficial, we have allowed language differences to get in the way of us reaching agreement. In reality, this probably speaks volumes about the false foundation on which the whole of this cooperation is based.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament believes that the report on the Black Sea strategy really is important and timely, because it provides an assessment of what has been achieved in the Black Sea region so far and gives a number of recommendations as to what the European Union can still do in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We believe that the political coordination among partners who have highly differentiated levels of cooperation with the European Union is difficult, but not impossible. It also makes sense at a political level to try and combine our efforts, bearing in mind that three of the countries are European Union Member States, one is a strategic partner, and others are part of the Eastern Partnership, while Turkey is a candidate for membership</p>
      <p sl="bg">The European Union’s inability to engage more energetically in the region has, at least hitherto, deprived us of the development and opportunity to use a great potential, and in this sense, we should say at the present time that the Black Sea Synergy, which, from the outset, was assessed as an insufficiently ambitious initiative on the part of the European Union, has to be developed into a proper strategy for the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We already have models of interaction that can be applied successfully, provided, of course, that we adapt them to the region. An example is the Baltic Sea strategy, which, at macro level, has been successful in developing regional cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We believe that several steps – not all of which were included in the report – need to be taken right now. First, at a practical level, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy review being done at the moment, we have to consider a greater coherence between the Black Sea Synergy and the Eastern Partnership, as almost all countries of the Eastern Partnership save Belarus are also part of the Black Sea Synergy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The second aspect is that political dialogue needs to be strengthened at ministerial as well as parliamentary level, and we should try and find a greater coherence between the Danubian strategy and future initiatives for the Black Sea region. All this should result in a strategy that can go on stream with separate budgetary funding in the next budget framework.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the proposal contained in Mr Ungureanu’s resolution, which has now been adopted, for Black Sea policy to become a fully-fledged strategy, is worthy of widespread support. The fact that Bulgaria and Romania are EU Member States, the Eastern Partnership – the special relations with the countries of the Eastern Partnership and with Russia – and the negotiations being carried on with other countries in the region on EU membership all justify the region’s political significance for the European Union. The Black Sea has become an important region for the transit of energy resources and for promising projects which are important for the Union, such as the Nabucco project, which is strategically important for the diversification of gas supply. I fully share, too, the opinion of Mr Ungureanu, whom I congratulate on the report, that the strategy must ensure the recognition of all actors in the region, and not just of the biggest states, and that it must fit in with other strategies, such as the strategy for the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007, part of the Black Sea became an inland sea of the European Union. The region is of exceptional strategic importance and our involvement there needs to be intensified. To this end, it is vital for Parliament to draw up a new strategy, in addition to providing financial and human resources, in the form of a separate item of the EU budget. The new strategy must serve to ensure the peace, stability and prosperity of the Black Sea region, and to guarantee the energy security of the EU. The diversification of supply lines and resources must be given even higher priority, and I would therefore like to stress the importance of the planned development of liquid natural gas terminals at Black Sea ports. The transit routes crossing the region could also significantly improve supply to the EU. Further intensification of cooperation with the countries of the Black Sea is a vital element of the success of Nabucco, the Trans-Adriatic pipeline and the Pan-European oil pipeline, which are of special significance to the EU. For this reason, I voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, just as in the case of Belarus, I wanted to give my reason for the way I voted on the EU’s Black Sea strategy. I want to start by saying that the timing of the idea from my colleague, Traian Ungureanu, to draft an own-initiative report is extremely apt when the European Union is strengthening its regional policy by devising strategies for coastal regions such as the Baltic Sea, the High North and, in this instance, the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also wish to say how pleased I am that the amendments which I tabled have been included in the resolution text. These amendments highlighted the need to create a network of NGOs in this region, encourage programmes promoting intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, as well as initiatives such as the Black Sea Universities Network. In my view, all these measures are good examples of the way in which interaction between civil societies can generate positive synergy in the region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I wanted to stress not only the need to strike a balance between economic development and environmental protection, but also the need to implement fully the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution. I hope that this initiative adopted today in Parliament will receive the attention it is due from the Council as well, which ought to deal with this matter as a priority issue for the European agenda.</p>

A partnership is needed in order to implement legal reforms with regard to human rights in the country and, at the same time, enable the diversification of the national economy, bearing in mind some progress that has already been made, such as giving up its nuclear programme, or even international obligations that the state has with regard to human rights, in spite of sanctions applied by the UN.</p>

I would highlight the role of the framework agreement, which includes measures to assist the development of institutional capacity as a means of reinforcing civil society, aids modernisation, encourages the introduction of democratic reforms and the creation of independent social communication and the rule of law, and supports other efforts aimed at opening up space for companies, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations and other Libyan players.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The economic partnership between Europe and Libya is already a reality. Libya holds the largest confirmed oil reserves in Africa and is Europe’s third largest energy (oil and gas) supplier. What is more, the EU is Libya’s biggest trading partner (with 70% of its total trade in 2009). Europe has to recognise that Libya plays an important role in the field of regional and world security, both in the context of containing Islamic extremism and also in the context of regional stabilisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, it is to be welcomed that a partnership framework agreement is being negotiated but, as is quite clear in the report, it must not leave aside certain questions that I consider to be fundamental: the progressive democratisation of the regime; greater respect for human rights, in particular, freedom in its various forms; a progressive change in the criminal law system, aiming to abandon the death penalty; acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court; and ratification of the 1951 Geneva Convention.</p>

Libya has 6 million inhabitants, 2 million of whom are foreigners. It has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa and is Europe’s third most important supplier of energy, in the form of oil and gas. The EU is its biggest trade partner: transactions between the two parties represent almost 70% of Libya’s trade in 2009. The framework partnership agreement with the EU must be seen as an opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of human values and democracy in terms of sustained and diversified development. As this report points out, this process cannot be dissociated from the fundamental values of the EU, such as combating the death penalty and discrimination against minorities, immigrants and refugees, such as promoting public health, and such as the need for political democratisation.</p>

A dictatorship, ignorance of human rights, lack of a migration policy and a poorly developed health service are just some of the problems which Libyans and foreigners living in Libya have to face up to every day. On the other hand, the potential, the rich natural resources and the cultural heritage of this region of Africa are values which can enable Libya to achieve economic development, an improvement in the quality of life of the people who live there and the opening up of the country to international markets. Hammering out suitable conditions for the EU-Libya agreement, which means persuading the Libyan authorities to end practices which violate fundamental human rights, to change migration policy and to accept legal responsibility, will bring mutual benefits and contribute to the region’s development.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report adopted today contains proposals that the European Parliament considers indispensable in order to wind up the ongoing negotiations between the European Union and Libya aimed at the conclusion of a cooperation agreement. The conclusion of the framework agreement would provide an opportunity to tackle important issues such as political relations, immigration and security, energy, public health, development, trade, climate change, energy and culture. At the same time, it would be a decisive step towards achieving the more general aim of improving relations between the Mediterranean area of the European Union and Africa. As an Italian MEP, I have to emphasise the historical and economic reasons that have led to Italy’s favourable relations with Libya over the years. At the same time, I have to emphasise the importance of strengthening cooperation between the EU and Libya, and by this I mean cooperation not just in economic matters, but also from the point of view of safeguarding human rights. It is my hope that the European Union can play a leading role in the reception of migrants and in supporting the fight against trafficking in human beings.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This report is astonishing in its contradictions. It welcomes negotiations on the EU-Libya Framework Agreement with a view to eventually bringing Libya into the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area (EMFTA) that eurocracy has been preparing for the past 15 years. However, it also lists a whole series of violations of human rights and democracy by a regime it describes as authoritarian. Meanwhile, the common position against Cuba is being maintained. This is a case of double standards. For today’s European Union, the prerequisite for trade is not respect for human rights and democracy but rather the establishment of a market economy and free, distorted competition. The Union represents cowardly imperialism, as evidenced by its belated response to the situation in Tunisia.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are all aware that Libya is persisting in a dictatorial regime, and is systematically violating international conventions on fundamental rights and freedoms. In spite of these facts, Libya has been expanding its trade and political relations with a number of EU Member States. The role of Libya, as partner on many issues in the Mediterranean region and in Africa, has been found to have a major impact on the security and stability of the region, in particular, on migration, public health, development, trade and economic relations, climate change, energy and cultural heritage. In this context, the framework agreement being negotiated at the moment is important, but we must not fail to respond to several fundamental issues, in particular: the progressive democratisation of the regime, respect for human rights, changes to the criminal justice system, with the abolition of the death penalty as a first priority, and signing up to the Geneva Convention.</p>

      <p sl="de">On account of their complexity and significance for Europe, relations between the European Union and Libya must be considered objectively. Naturally, respect for human rights play an important role, which is why it also makes sense for Brussels to call on Libya to ratify the Geneva Convention on Refugees of 1951 or to urge a moratorium on the death penalty. However, we must also consider the fact that Libya is an important transit country for illegal mass immigration from Africa to Europe. For this reason, no purpose will be served by a general rejection of a readmission agreement with Tripoli, as contained in the report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we do not get a readmission agreement with Libya, the pressure on Europe as a destination for immigrants will increase even further. Because illegal mass immigration is a vital issue in relation to the survival of Europe as an historical entity, the EU would be well advised to take a differentiated view of its relations with Tripoli and to include Libya in its strategies for controlling the flow of migration.</p>

The primary aim of the agreement is to improve the lives of the Libyan people in political, social and economic terms through the promotion of fundamental rights as the founding basis of the agreement. The agreement will seek to make up for Libya’s shortcomings by providing greater protection of human and democratic rights and developing commercial cooperation, as well as by establishing strict joint controls over illegal immigration.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The green light has reluctantly been given for the negotiations between the EU and Libya to continue, as a means of strengthening our relationship. However, it is anything but a blank cheque. Our energy security, our commercial and economic interests, and our cooperation in managing migratory flows should never conceal the continual disregard shown by the Libyan authorities and Colonel Gaddafi for the most basic human rights. Colonel Gaddafi is a dictator who has been in power for 41 years, and who said just a few days ago that he regrets the departure of his Tunisian counterpart, Mr Ben Ali. It is a repressive regime: death penalties (506 in May 2009 – of which 50% were foreigners), executions and corporal punishment, illegal detention and inhumane treatment of migrants crossing its territory to reach Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our resolution particularly stresses this point by recalling that any common migration policy must be conditional on more stringent safeguards for the protection of migrants and other fundamental freedoms. Similarly, any readmission agreement with that country should automatically exclude asylum seekers, refugees, or those in need of protection, and should avoid collective expulsions.</p>

      <p sl="en">For over 40 years, Libya has been ruled by a dictatorial regime in which power is concentrated in one man, Colonel Gaddafi, the longest serving African and Arab leader. Libyans enjoy free education and healthcare and subsidised housing, benefiting from some degree of social distribution of the oil income. Yet, despite the GDP growth rates, development lags behind that of other oil-rich countries and Libya is one of the less diversified economies in the region, foreign investment remaining at the mercy of the unpredictable decisions of the ruler.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Libyan people do not enjoy basic human rights and freedoms, despite the fact that their state has specific international obligations to respect human rights, having been recently elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council and having ratified a number of legally binding international instruments. Capital punishment is regularly carried out.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, Libya’s strategic importance and the many challenges it poses underline the need for a comprehensive EU policy towards Libya. The EU needs to engage with Libya across a broad range of issues. This framework agreement must also be a substantive tool to promote the rule of law, respect for human rights, protection of migrants and refugees and sustainable development in Libya.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that it can help the Libyan people to improve their living conditions, which are often conditioned by a lack of respect for human rights and the most basic freedoms.</p>

Prisoners often suffer torture, corporal punishment such as flogging, beating, electric shocks and the deliberate withholding of medical assistance. There are no asylum laws in Libya and, as a result, there is no legal recognition of the need to guarantee protection for refugees.</p>
      <p sl="it">As if this were not enough, the death penalty still applies to a large number of crimes, and death sentences continue to be handed down by the Libyan courts, in breach of international standards concerning the right to a fair trial. The European Union must conclude the framework agreement as soon as possible. It will be the first proper agreement between Libya and the EU, and will therefore bring real benefits to the local population in terms of their fundamental rights as well as in political and socio-economic terms.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today’s vote on the EU-Libya Framework Agreement is the result of some tough negotiations, particularly on the issue of migrants. In Libya, the situation regarding human rights for refugees and asylum seekers is extremely dangerous. They have no legal recognition and there is no system in place to protect them. I hope that their fundamental human rights will be safeguarded, along with their right to asylum.</p>
      <p sl="it">Libya has not ratified the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 or the Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, and at the moment, does not intend to do so. However, in 1981, it did ratify the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. It is therefore bound to comply with the principle of non-refoulement of migrants requiring international protection, who must be identified in accordance with criteria that are no less strict than those established by the Geneva Convention itself.</p>
      <p sl="it">Under international law, people from countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia have the right to humanitarian protection and political asylum, and I hope that the Libyan authorities will agree to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this important resolution as we have to condemn in the strongest terms the recent attacks on Christian communities around the world – be it in Egypt, Pakistan, Iraq or any other country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Christian communities have been living in various Muslim countries of the Middle East since the early days of Christianity. It is therefore totally unacceptable that, after centuries of peaceful cohabitation, Christians should be forced to flee these countries or be closed up in ghettos. This is yet another reason to continue our struggle against Islamic fundamentalists who distort reality and want to portray our global action against terrorism as an attack on the Muslim world. It is precisely the Islamic fundamentalists who are seeking war between religions and civilisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must therefore do everything possible to root out these religious fanatics and to marginalise them in their respective societies.

This attack comes on top of a series of grave events, all of which were religiously motivated. This is a very sensitive subject. The European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very attached to secular principles and is in favour of respect being shown for all religions in Europe, including Islam. This being so, we cannot remain indifferent to the fate awaiting a number of Christian communities throughout the world. Every religion must be shown equal respect, and that is why I endorsed this European Parliament resolution. All of the events that Parliament is condemning took place in Muslim countries, where particular attention must be paid to the fate of Christians.

The attacks against Christians in recent months are a tragedy for the many victims, particularly in Baghdad and Alexandria, but also for their co-religionists. Christians have lived in the East for 2 000 years; they are inscribed in the history of their country. Today, however, they are fleeing the region en masse. Because of this forced exile, these countries are losing a substantial proportion of their human resources. The Near and Middle East regions have always been an area of diversity and cohabitation of religious minorities. The terrorists behind these attacks are trying to instigate a clash between East and West, pitting the Muslim world against the Christian world. All of this has been fiendishly planned. Christians in Iraq and Egypt may be feeling abandoned and betrayed. It is important that the Egyptian and Iraqi authorities find and harshly judge the authors of these massacres.</p>

The hope is that this resolution will mark the beginning of a change in approach by Union bodies, especially from a diplomatic and commercial viewpoint, in their bilateral dialogues with the many – too many – countries that tolerate anti-Christian persecutions, or even lend support to the culture of Christianophobia. When the EU signs commercial, economic and cooperation agreements with third countries, it really must enforce the human rights clauses with great determination, which is something it has not done up to now. It is no longer acceptable to see that countries where Christians are discriminated against and persecuted have signed important agreements with the EU that are fundamentally based on respect for human rights.

      <p sl="it">I am pleased that the European Parliament has debated and adopted a resolution condemning the recent attacks on Christians. Religious freedom is one of the main fundamental human rights; one that is generally recognised by national constitutions and international conventions. The existence of so many standards at various levels of governance, both national and international, and all over the world, shows that there is unanimous consensus about the importance of religious freedom. However, legislation is not enough. It is the foundation on which to build effective policies. Over the last 50 years, the globalisation process has brought distant civilisations into contact with each another. In order to make sure that such contact does not turn into conflict, it is not enough just to condemn the recent attacks. We need to reaffirm our commitment to the creation of policies that encourage religious pluralism and ensure that different groups learn to be tolerant of each other. It is not just fundamentalism that is the threat. Today, religious freedom is also under attack from widespread secularism, which is trying to eliminate the spiritual world of the individual from public life. Religious freedom concerns all religions; it even concerns atheists. This is because, when there is acceptance of religious freedom, there is also acceptance of its opposite, in other words, the freedom not to profess any religion.</p>

This worrying and deplorable fact has to be deeply regretted, particularly since Christianity preaches peace and understanding between men, regardless of whether they are Jews or Greeks, as St Paul would say. What is being threatened is the religious freedom and peace of communities that have existed for centuries. They have lived peacefully alongside other religions in the areas where they are settled and are the subject of indiscriminate violence simply because they believe in Christ. The question goes much further, however. Apart from the attacks that have been made, the Christian faith and its manifestations are also being attacked in Europe itself, often in the guise of the corruption of such concepts as secularity and the neutrality of states and institutions. In this respect, I must deplore the recent attacks on the celebration of Catholic mass in Barcelona and call on the Spanish Government and the European institutions to condemn and combat the Christophobic atmosphere that seems to be on the rise.

This right confers the freedom to practice your own religion or beliefs, individually or together with others, both in public and in private, through worship, rites, practices and teaching.

In fact, it is well known that innocent lives have recently been lost in bloody attacks against Christian communities in Nigeria, Alexandria, the Philippines, Iraq and Syria. In addition, the Iranian Government has intensified its campaign against Christians in the Islamic Republic. In Vietnam, too, there is severe repression of the activities of the Catholic Church and other religious communities. In addition to condemning these attacks and urging governments to guarantee freedom of religion, conscience and thought, the Council, Commission and also the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs must dedicate greater attention to the issue of religious freedom and take specific, urgent measures, including measures against the countries that deliberately do not protect religious confessions.</p>

The European Union, through its High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, should make freedom of religion and belief and the security of religious communities, including Christians, a priority in the Union’s international relations.

It was a good thing that the resolution that we have adopted brings us to the present time, to consider the martyrs of today. The premise is that freedom of religion must apply to all religions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Since we raise the issue separately of the persecution experienced by Christians, this does not mean that we are biased. It is because this, the largest group of those suffering persecution, is the one that tends to be the easiest to forget about in Europe. It is time to put this right, for we know that in the last century, more Christians died because of their faith than in the previous 1 900 years. Of those killed now because of their religion, 75% are Christians.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Open Doors International has listed the 10 countries where Christians encounter most violence in the world. They are North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, the Maldives, Afghanistan, Yemen, Mauritania, Laos and Uzbekistan, but the list goes on. Approximately 100 million Christians every day suffer violence because of their religion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Obviously, something concrete must come from the resolution that we have adopted. The European External Action Service must show determination and address these failings surrounding freedom of religion. Our foreign policy agreements with third countries must include a clause on freedom of religion and reciprocity. From the perspective of the promotion of human rights, it is crucially important to speak about freedom of religion, because that is the human rights litmus test: freedom of speech and expression and freedom of association lie at the heart of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">In recent years, 75% of terrorist attacks of a religious nature have been against Christians. In the last few months in particular, there has been an increase in the number of attacks, including direct attacks on churches while services were being held. It is unacceptable in the 21st century for religious communities to have to be afraid to practise their faith freely. The principle of the freedom of religion must apply to everyone throughout the world. I therefore support the proposal to develop a strategy to actually enable the right to freedom of religious expression to be exercised.</p>

      <p sl="de">The lip service paid by the European Union to religious freedom is not enough. In Islamic countries in particular, Christians are seen as fair game for suppression and, frequently, murder. Despite this shocking situation, the EU, as a lofty community of values, has mostly chosen a policy of polite silence. All in all, it would seem as if the political elite in Brussels, which is indifferent to Europe’s Christian roots, has also forgotten the fate of Christians in Islamic countries. Instead of demanding an end to the persecution of Christians, we take refuge in political correctness, preferring to concern ourselves with the welfare of those Muslims living in the EU, who enjoy a level of religious freedom that most Christians in the Islamic world can only dream of.</p>
      <p sl="de">In future, the plight of Christians must play a special role in the management of the EU’s foreign relations with Islamic countries.

      <p sl="en">The European Union has repeatedly expressed its commitment to freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and freedom of thought, and has stressed that governments have a duty to guarantee these freedoms all over the world.

      <p sl="it">This military occupation is still ongoing. Thirty-eight thousand Turkish soldiers are garrisoned in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the island is divided in two by walls and fences that even divide towns and villages. Over the years, 520 Christian churches and monasteries have been systematically destroyed and replaced by minarets. The artworks in these churches have been burnt, desecrated or plundered; the cemeteries have been destroyed and Christian bishops are prohibited from holding Mass. On Christmas Day, Turkish police officials prevented Mass being celebrated in Karpasia at the Church of St. Synesios in Rizokarpaso and the Church of the Holy Trinity. However, the most incredible thing is that there are many Members of Parliament who defend Christians around the world, and yet they are in favour of Turkey joining the EU.</p>

The statistics provided by international organisations are appalling – they say that around 150 000 Christians are murdered worldwide every year. We must not be indifferent to such disregard for human life. The European Union, as a guardian of fundamental democratic values and human rights, should maintain better monitoring of the situation in third countries, and in the Middle East in particular. Our efforts should be unequivocal and more resolute. Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, and religiously motivated discrimination and violence are inconsistent with our values. By respecting these rights, we set an example to other countries, but we should be equally effective in exacting the same respect from others. Human rights are universal and should be respected everywhere, and we should react decisively to any kind of expression of intolerance and, in particular, to religious intolerance. The Union has suitable instruments at its disposal which permit us to force the governments of countries with which we maintain political or commercial relations to act properly and to respect civil liberties, including freedom of religion. In Muslim countries, but also in countries such as China, India and Nepal, churches and chapels are burned with impunity, people are turned out onto the street, tortured or even killed and women are forced to undergo abortions. In the name of correct economic relations, these things are not brought up at the negotiating table. Europe must not remain silent.</p>

To attack these communities is to undermine our most fundamental values. Respect for religious diversity and religious freedom is a universal principle that must be upheld. These attacks, carried out in the name of some extremist obscurantism from another era, are designed to create a climate of fear, and in the end, it is the survival of these ancient communities that is directly under threat.

Therefore, I would like to stress paragraph 15, which invites the EU Member States not to weaken EU joint actions with bilateral initiatives that could undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the European approach. Also, I see not holding the 2014 World Ice Hockey Championships in Minsk as being one of the most efficient levers in the proposal for exerting influence on the Belarus authorities to abandon their repressive politics.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Union has always considered humanitarian policy and the protection of fundamental human rights to be its priorities. Its vocation, which today allows it to play a leading role on the world stage and export beyond its borders the principles of democracy, respect for human rights and legality, enables us to understand the reasons behind the proposal for a joint resolution aimed at calling on Belarus to respect all the efforts that have been made on matters of international law and human rights. The events that occurred during the elections on 19 December are, sadly, well known. They were characterised by the brutal repression of popular demonstrations complaining about a number of obvious cases of vote rigging, carried out by the police and secret service agents. Such unacceptable events have led the European Parliament, acting on statements made previously by its President, Mr Buzek, to call on the Union to impose heavy sanctions on Belarus and to launch an enquiry by external, impartial authorities to reconstruct what happened and ascertain who was responsible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The countries of the former socialist bloc understand the political situation in Belarus very well – restrictions on personal freedom and on freedom of the press and the media, and an undemocratic system of government. In view of the recent events in Belarus following the presidential elections, I would like to draw attention to the steps which the European Parliament will take together with the Commission and the Council to intervene in this matter. After all, we must talk about measures for helping Belarusian democracy and seek effective ways of reconsidering EU policy towards the Lukashenko regime. In the present situation, we must put pressure on Minsk and request the release of political prisoners and cessation of the persecution of journalists.

      <p sl="cs">We should not just close the door and thereby reduce the chance for improved dialogue. The introduction of strict sanctions might, through its impact, create a barrier and isolate this country even more. In the final analysis, the greatest impact would, in all probability, be felt by persons other than the ones targeted. Communications between the EU and Belarus should continue intensively, making use of all the possibilities of diplomacy, and reviewed regularly. As far as effectiveness is concerned, it should involve establishing a different kind of dialogue, held in a different form and at different levels, including a balanced, rather than a one-sided, assessment. The cornerstone, however, should be a careful assessment of experience to date in mutual communications between the EU and Belarus, on the basis of which the experience could be incorporated into a strategic plan clearly reflecting EU foreign policy on this country.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This could lead, in the long-term, to improved relations and the start of new cooperation projects, contributing to the further development of this country and preserving its sovereignty. The Eastern Partnership can play a significant role here.</p>

      <p sl="it">A general consensus has emerged from the debate in this Chamber that Europe needs to react strongly to the recent events that took place in Belarus following the presidential elections there.</p>
      <p sl="it">Personally, I believe a coordinated approach should be adopted: while, on the one hand, Europe wants to put some kind of pressure on the Belarusian Government, on the other, it must not completely cut off cooperation with the Minsk authorities, without thereby endorsing their policy. Such an approach would, in fact, only hurt the people of Belarus. That is why we need to continue to support all the measures that favour civil society and protect the opposition, independent mass media and non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">It appears, therefore, that the cooperation mechanisms between the European Union and Belarus should not be interrupted at all, since they alone can make a real contribution to the country’s wellbeing and to its social and democratic growth. I would therefore argue that the ‘critical dialogue’ that the 27 Member States of the EU have already put in place should be maintained, in order to convince Belarus that it must strengthen its resolve to move towards European standards in terms of respect for democracy and protection of human rights.</p>

Arrests, searches and further convictions continued over the next few days. This unacceptable attitude towards the opposition should be of great concern to us. Anyone arrested for political reasons should be released immediately. There must be no further persecution of the opposition, democratic forces, or civil society representatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The position taken by the authorities is also puzzling because it runs counter to that adopted during the election campaign, during which we witnessed the emergence of pluralistic forces, the formation of a real opposition and an active civil society.

      <p sl="de">There are comments in the media claiming that the reintroduction of the sanctions against Belarus’ President Lukashenko, which were relaxed more than two years ago, would be tantamount to admitting that our longstanding efforts at rapprochement have failed. The fact is that these efforts had failed before now, for example, at the time of the presidential elections and, if not sooner, they had certainly done so by the time the OSCE offices in Minsk were closed and accusations of attempted destabilisation were made against Germany and Poland.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, in many instances, the resolution exaggerates the issues, making what is basically a good text susceptible to criticism. For example, a call to ban all government officials and representatives of the justice system from entering the EU will not achieve the intended objective. The cancellation of the 2014 World Ice Hockey Championships would be a similar example of excessive megaphone diplomacy. It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I agree that there should be a fundamental review of EU policy on Belarus at the next Foreign Affairs Council. I believe that not just in the European Parliament and the Commission, but also at ministerial level and the level of Heads of State, constant attention needs to be paid to Belarus and the situation in it, because Belarus is a country that shares a border with the EU. The appointment of EU coordinators for Belarusian affairs might ensure united action by the EU as regards this country. I support the provision that the EU should freeze the visa ban for an extended list of Belarus officials but, at the same time, unlock contacts and travel within the EU for ordinary Belarusians as much as possible. Lithuania is following this route, having signed an agreement on streamlined cross-border movement with Belarus, and issuing free visas to Belarusian citizens. I also support the objective of establishing the ‘most sensitive areas’ and reaching a decision on the application of targeted sanctions, while directing and adapting EU assistance to Belarusian civil society. I call on the Commission to find ways of increasing access to independent information for the Belarusian population. The European Humanities University in Vilnius is one of the most successful long-term development cooperation projects as regards Belarus. Faced with such an internal situation in Belarus, where all roads to becoming a critical, conscious and free citizen have long been blocked, the EHU is becoming not just an island of free Belarusian thought, but also a breeding ground for future Belarusian leaders. EU assistance for this university should therefore not only be maintained, but increased. That is logical and something we should welcome.</p>

The European Union cannot stand by and watch that happen: we all need to focus our attention on securing the release of those people after what happened following the election. That is one of the reasons why my vote in favour is intended as a gesture of assent for a joint resolution to provide support for Belarus to participate in the process of cooperating with the European Union. In my view, we need to address this issue quickly and practically in a coordinated approach that actively supports civil society and protects the opposition and their families.

      <p sl="ro">One of the principles of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that Member States must adopt an economic policy ‘in accordance with the principles of the open market economy, based on fair competition’. The purpose of the competition policy is to create genuine competition on the single market using measures relating to the market’s structures and the behaviour of its actors. Free competition fosters innovation, reduces production costs, increases economic efficiency and, consequently, boosts the level of the European economy’s competitiveness.

In the worldwide approach, we have to concentrate, among other things, on the rules of play in the market, and also at the cost side of competitive producers from outside the European Union. This concerns Chinese and Korean producers in particular. I welcome the call for completion of the single railway market throughout Europe. Healthy principles of competition can contribute to revitalisation of the railways and increase their share of the transport market. This may bring us closer to the idea of a European railway system, similar to the road or aviation system.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The year 2009 was a difficult year for the European Union, marked by the especially serious financial and economic crisis, and it was not alone in this. The negative effects of this crisis hit the economy and business environment hard, as well as decision makers. While decision makers have tried to draw up policies that will minimise the impact of the crisis on the real economy, the European Commission, together with Member States and central banks, has worked hard to stabilise the financial system. This year’s report pays particular attention to these issues and notes with satisfaction the rapid response from the Commission and its successful application of competition policy measures. I voted in favour of this report as I think that the European Union needs a strong competition policy, founded on the principle of a free market and fair competition in all sectors, which will generate a successful internal market and will favour the creation of sustainable, knowledge-based jobs.</p>

We are therefore asking for a ‘colegislative’ role and for Parliament to be regularly informed of any initiatives in this field. We wish to emphasise that an EU competition policy based on the principles of open markets and a level playing field in all sectors is a cornerstone of a successful internal market and a precondition for the creation of sustainable jobs. We therefore underline our call for greater consistency between all EU policies and the priorities set out in the EU 2020 strategy for growth and jobs. It is necessary to draft clearer competition rules that encourage the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are a driver of growth in all our economies. At the same time, we call on the Member States to cooperate actively with the Commission in developing and evaluating the temporary rules established in response to the financial and economic crisis by providing accurate, detailed reports on their implementation and effectiveness.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The analysis of the report on 2009 competition policy shows that the economic crisis, which started in 2008, may have had some effect on this very policy, not least because the Member States have provided aid to their respective economies in different ways. It is time to analyse the consequences of this aid for the internal market and interpret whether it has distorted free competition. We cannot forget that EU competition policy is based on open-market principles and on an activity plan that is equitable in all sectors; this constitutes the foundation of a successful internal market and a precondition for the creation of sustainable, knowledge-based jobs.</p>

      <p sl="de">The financial and economic crisis that has rocked the financial markets has naturally also impacted on competition policy. This impact is apparent in the growing budgetary deficits and increasing public debt in many Member States, slowing down economic recovery, and also in the state supports provided in response to the financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">The government guarantees have led to a variety of effects and distortions, such as a reduction in the spread of private loans, as well as an impact on the strategy followed by the pension funds. European policy on competition should make the internal market competitive on a global level. There is little doubt that a coordinated approach in this area makes sense. However, it should not degenerate into an attack on sovereignty. For this reason, I have voted against the report.</p>

In terms of competition for 2009, following the recovery of the financial sector, the Commission carried out – as it is still doing – the essential task of supervising the banks’ repayment of the State aid disbursed to revitalise the economy. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need to be supported first of all. Since SMEs have a crucial role to play for the European economy as a whole on account of their great innovation potential, they need clear, fair and non-discriminatory competition rules in order to facilitate cross-border transactions and to take advantage of the EU market by making effective use of SEPA (the Single Euro Payments Area).</p>

      <p sl="it">It is becoming increasingly obvious, including in the light of the Commission’s 2009 Report on Competition Policy in Europe, that competition policy is an essential tool that will help the European Union to have a dynamic, efficient and innovative internal market and to be competitive on the global stage, as well as to overcome the financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, the European Parliament must have a more active role, starting by increasing its involvement in any of the Commission’s initiatives in this field, as the Commission is the sole EU-wide competent competition authority. The report points out that small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important for the whole European economy, stresses the major innovation potential of small and medium-sized enterprises, and reiterates its previous request to the Commission to adopt new initiatives with a focus on fair and non-discriminatory competition conditions for such companies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We want the internal market to be effective, dynamic and innovative. Competition policy is the right tool for achieving these objectives. A priority for the next period is to ensure lasting growth by increasing employment levels, which will result in a strengthening of our competitiveness. This will contribute to an improvement in the Union’s world position and allow us to overcome the crisis but, above all, it will raise our citizens’ quality of life. If competition is operating properly in the market for goods and services, we can guarantee better quality, lower prices and greater choice for the consumer. In particular, we must remember small and medium-sized enterprises, which not only provide jobs for most of our citizens, but also possess huge potential for innovation. Therefore, it is very important to create fair and non-discriminatory conditions for them to operate, and to develop very clear and transparent rules of competition. The Commission’s effective use of the instruments of competition policy allowed stabilisation of the economy and moderation of the effects of the economic crisis on businesses and consumers. The year 2009 was one in which help was essential in order to maintain the integrity and competitiveness of the single market. The policy of State aid is a crucial element of competition policy, because it allows equal opportunities to be guaranteed to all businesspeople operating in the single market. However, that aid should be monitored, so that it does not impair the working of the market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The analysis of the report on Competition Policy prepared by the European Commission relating to 2009 allows us to draw conclusions concerning the advantages of this European policy. The European free competition policy is one of the key policies of European integration. The underlying concept aims to establish an internal market where its economic players can freely initiate and exercise their activities. As stated in this document, I believe that it is necessary to have clear competition rules so that the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is a real possibility. At present, the European Union is passing through one of the most serious periods of economic and financial crisis in its entire history and the activity of SMEs is vital for re-booting the economy. I am pleased to see the development of greater synergies between competition policy and consumer protection policy. However, I regret that there is still unfair competition in the energy market and I support the invitation made to the European Commission in the document put to the vote today to monitor closely the implementation by the Member States of the third energy liberalisation package.</p>

The EU plays an important role in this region and already has shared competences in a number of areas, as well as exclusive ones such as fisheries. In addition, the EU plays a leading role on certain policies, such as environmental and climate-change research. In addition to this situation, it is necessary to take into account the fact that some Arctic partners are already major suppliers of energy, raw materials and fish to Europe. Their variety of resources and potential for alternative sources of energy can only be developed through an eco-systematic approach and with integrated management plans. Also, the development of new trade routes may benefit the European economy, given the privileged position of Europe to supply services, such as Global Positioning System coverage using the Galileo system.</p>

The Arctic is a sensitive region where the effects of climate change are especially visible, having serious repercussions on other regions in the world. Therefore, the best protection for the Arctic is a long-term and ambitious global climate agreement, but the rapid warming of the Arctic makes it necessary, in addition, to work on possible further short-term measures to limit Arctic warming. This is particularly important given the increasing interest in the exploitation of resources. We also must not forget the indigenous peoples whose economies rely, to a significant extent, on sustainable use of natural resources and therefore, the reduction of climate change and its effects and the right of the indigenous peoples to an unpolluted natural environment are also questions of human rights.</p>

This question needs to be dealt with on a global level, since its causes lie outside the Arctic and, in turn, will also affect the whole globe. The EU is already a frontrunner in research and in environmental and climate change policies in the international context and will continue to be so. Having said this, and recalling the contribution already made today by the EU and its Member States as regards research, funding, its impact through EU legislation on the environment, climate, fisheries, etc., as well as the possibilities for cooperation in the future on issues such as the development of mapping and maritime safety, economic development and the like, it can be concluded that the EU has a lot to contribute to the sustainable development of the Arctic.

      <p sl="de">The Arctic’s untold mineral resources have made the area the subject of heated dispute. It is estimated that 90 billion barrels of oil alone lie untapped under the ice. Inevitably, there is a feeling of unease that BP of all companies, having caused the oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico last year, is now to be allowed to extract resources in this sensitive natural environment, where conditions are far more extreme than in the Gulf. After all, the fact is that the Arctic region already provides the final resting place for the world’s mercury emissions. In view of global warming and the expected consequences, this is a problem that cannot be overestimated. I have voted in favour of the report, because it adequately presents the many factors involved.</p>

      <p sl="it">The climate change that has affected the Arctic region in recent years highlights the responsibility that the European Union should accept for such an important and urgent situation. These effects are greater in the Arctic than in other regions, and sea-level rise and climate change are nothing but a consequence of the greenhouse gases that the EU is constantly emitting. I believe my vote in favour of a sustainable policy for the High North is of crucial importance, in that the region needs to be safeguarded and protected since it has had to face disastrous environmental impacts that do not depend directly on its own territory but on the more industrialised European countries. The problem needs to be tackled at a global level, therefore, because its causes lie outside the Arctic but, in turn, have an effect on the whole planet. In addition, the region has vast natural resources of energy sources and minerals, and the EU has an interest in ensuring the security of the supplies needed for Europe’s people and industries. The Arctic is therefore a major contributor of energy, raw materials and also fish for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">The Parliamentary report on the High North adopted today constitutes an important step forward in setting the guidelines for European policy on the Arctic region. Climate change and the resulting melting of the ice caps are causing changes to the region and the focus of the Arctic states, which have worked swiftly to define strategies for tackling the possibilities that are arising. More specifically, the melting of the ice caps is opening up new opportunities in the creation of new navigation routes and the exploitation of natural resources. I have supported this report as it highlights the responsibility of the EU in the climate change process that is changing the physiognomy of the Arctic, as well as the need to take appropriate action to mitigate this process.</p>
      <p sl="es">Similarly, the report recognises the legitimate interest of the EU to play a role on the new stage and stresses the imperative to take advantage of the opportunities that arise through supporting sustainable development in the area by its inhabitants, particularly the indigenous communities. It is also important to note that the report signals the need to comply with international law with regard to any action taken in the Arctic first of all, and secondly, to pursue a cooperative approach in the governance of the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Arctic region is attracting more and more attention, due to the effects of climate change, the main trigger of developments. Its effects are on a larger scale than in other regions of the world. At the same time, those changes are affecting other regions of the world, through rising sea levels, on the one hand, and consequences for adjacent regional climates, on the other. Thus, Europe does not only bear a certain responsibility, being one of the main contributors to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, but also has a particular interest in the Arctic, since it will have to deal with the consequences of the changes taking place there from environmental and climate-change issues to the geopolitics of shipping routes and security of supply of resources.</p>

      <p sl="it">I supported this agreement because climate change and pollution originating in the industrialised parts of the world have unfortunately also reached the Arctic for some time now. This area is often described as pristine, but unfortunately, this has not been the case for many years. Unlike the Antarctic, the Arctic is inhabited and traditionally, its natural resources are exploited to the detriment of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">In 1996, in an attempt to curb the phenomenon, the Arctic Council was established to protect the environment in this region. Its members include three EU Member States – Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Emerging economies will increasingly need the resources which are to be found in plentiful supply in the Arctic. Energy, minerals, fish, gas, oil, wind and wave energy are all abundantly available in the region, which makes it vulnerable to speculation.</p>

I am doing so, firstly, because of the Commission proposal to develop the strategy for establishing measurable objectives and sectoral partnerships to facilitate joint projects, among other important measures. My second reason is that the rapporteur presents the need for an up-to-date assessment of EU activity in the Black Sea region. My last reason is because there is considerable fragmentation in funding for this strategy, as it is financed by various instruments. To put an end to this fragmentation, it is proposed that this strategy has its own line of finance.</p>

      <p sl="lt">(I voted in favour of this resolution on an EU strategy for the Black Sea. I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that given the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU and the rather limited results of the Black Sea Synergy, a strategy should be launched to enhance the coherence and visibility of EU action in the region and that the EU Black Sea strategy should be an integral part of the EU's broader foreign and security policy vision. Three years after devising the Black Sea Synergy, an analysis of the current situation indicates, first of all, the lack of a clear, comprehensive and updated picture on the implementation results of the Black Sea Synergy. Therefore, the EU strategy for the Black Sea should put in place a stronger policy framework and boost EU involvement in the Black Sea region. I support the opinion that the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region, while also ensuring EU energy security. As a consequence, security, good governance, energy, transport, environment, socio-economic and human development should be considered as priority actions. It is very important for a security dimension of the Black Sea to include resolute actions for strengthening democratic rule, good governance and State capacity building.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For some 50 years now, the European Union has brought peace and stability to the peoples of Western Europe. Nevertheless, we must not forget that our neighbouring countries continue to be plagued by serious unrest. The Union must be sensitive to this situation and must give fresh impetus to its strategy for the Black Sea region. This resolution provides such a response, and I therefore voted in favour of it. It creates a new budget line, which will give priority to the financing of small-scale development projects and cross-border cooperation, and strengthens human resources. An ‘early-warning system’ will act as a conflict prevention and confidence building tool in the region by anticipating any escalation of violence.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the report on an EU strategy for the Black Sea. The strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU was recognised in 2007, in the context of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU. As developments in this region, strategically situated at the junction of Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, started having a direct impact on EU internal affairs, the EU acknowledged the need to reflect upon its stronger involvement in the area. This resulted in the launch of a new EU policy approach towards the region, called the Black Sea Synergy. The aim of the Black Sea Synergy is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region, as well as within the region. However, much less was achieved in the field of implementation, while sectors such as stability, democracy and good governance seem to have witnessed less progress in a context of deterioration of the democratic rule in several Black Sea states and of the Russia-Georgia war in 2008. Furthermore, the region continues to face the following challenges: protracted conflicts, trends towards militarisation and proliferation of arms, maritime surveillance, illicit trafficking and cross-border crime. I believe that in order to achieve efficient implementation, it is necessary to devise mechanisms for regular reporting, monitoring, evaluation and follow-up. In addition, the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region, while also ensuring EU energy security. As a consequence, security, good governance, energy, transport, environmental, socio-economic and human development should be considered as priority actions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I voted in favour of the Ungureanu report, because I firmly believe that the EU urgently needs a cohesive and visible strategy for the Black Sea region. The strategy should be closely linked to the European Neighbourhood Policy, the development of which was given a major boost by the Czech Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2009. The key priority of the EU’s Black Sea strategy should be to secure energy supplies to the EU, and related support for energy projects which are in the interests of the EU and which focus on diversifying gas supplies to the EU. The establishment of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly is also important and urgently required as regards the EU’s energy security.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Among the projects which the Black Sea strategy should be helping to implement, I would include the Nabucco project, the South Stream project, the project to bring liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe and the development of LNG terminals in Black Sea harbours, and also the pan-European Constanta-Trieste oil pipeline. The Commission should not delay and should conclude agreements by the end of 2011 with potential supplier countries for the Nabucco pipeline. The package of measures for energy infrastructure, which the Commission intends to submit in the near future, should place particular emphasis on the previously mentioned energy projects in the Black Sea region. Last but not least, it is necessary to emphasise the considerable potential of renewable energy sources in the Black Sea region, which may contribute significantly to the future energy security of the EU and the entire world.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome this motion and the parallel report currently with the Fisheries Committee. Both reports refer to the ‘Black Sea Synergy’. In the context of south-east Europe, the definition of synergy is one where it represents the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member. Apparently, there is a consensus amongst some in this place that the best individual member of the Black Sea Synergy is the EU. I would caution against this belief, certainly with regard to fisheries. The common fisheries policy has failed. I would say to my colleagues from the Black Sea region: learn from the mistakes of the CFP, examine the consequences the present regime has had on the small-scale fisheries of the north-east Atlantic and ask is this what we want for the Black Sea? The Black Sea strategy must be based on the uniqueness of the area. As we have seen, ideas that fit one part of Europe will not work in another part.</p>

Notwithstanding the tension that still exists, this is also a region that can have a more stable and balanced future, and the Union can play an important part in this stabilisation process. In this respect, it is necessary not only to establish objectives but, above all, to provide those responsible for implementing the European strategy with the human, technical and financial resources needed to allow them to do their job in the best possible way. Given their geographical situation, history and specific knowledge of the region, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece could make a valuable contribution to ensuring that the strategy to be devised is capable of achieving the objectives of promoting peace, security, democracy, good governance and economic, social and human development.</p>

In a context that includes EU Member States – Bulgaria, Greece and Romania – together with Turkey and various states of the former Soviet bloc, including Russia, the Black Sea is crucial to energy supply and the diversification of gas distribution. It is a strategic bridge that links Europe with the area of the Caspian Sea, Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as Southeast Asia and China. Among the many differences and rivalries, the close historical and cultural ties are particularly important, as are inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue. In this context, greater commitment from the EU is required, along with increased efficiency in formulating measures to assist the stabilisation and revitalisation of this region in a process that must involve all the countries concerned.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Nothing new emerges from this report. The strategies and objectives are the same as those that have formed the so-called external policy of the EU for a long time: controlling the natural resources of the region, in particular, oil and natural gas, on which the EU is dependent, securing their supply without problems, in addition to trying to guarantee access to its markets and the exploitation of workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The mechanisms for achieving these objectives are also the same: interference and recurrent attempts to limit the national sovereignty of these countries through international campaigns controlled by the major news agencies and non-governmental organisations financed by EU funds; the push towards militarism and the arms race, as in the case of the current re-arming of Georgia; and looking for people in these countries who, in exchange for benefits for themselves or the interests they serve, defend the interests of the EU and the United States, as well as their economic groups, by accepting NATO’s eastward expansion and allowing the installation of US military bases in the region, which have been used as a platform for supplying NATO troops in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is obvious that this road cannot be followed without surprises: imperialism, be it that of the US or the EU, faces the tenacious resistance of the people, who, both here and in those countries, are organising themselves to prevent such a backward step in the course of history.</p>

For these measures to be successful, they need to be consistent and to take into account the differences in conditions between particular countries. Care should also be taken to ensure that it is not just giving on our part. The countries of the Black Sea Basin have much to offer us, starting from sources of energy and natural riches. I share the rapporteur’s fears on the question of the lack of a clear strategy towards these countries. In this situation, a large role could be played by Bulgaria and Romania, which are already part of the Union. It is there that they understand the region’s politics best.

The Ungureanu report calls on both the Commission and the European External Action Service to establish a strategy for increasingly close relations of cooperation between the European Union and the Black Sea region. Such relations should, however, be subject to strict controls, in order to maintain effective coordination of activities and the subdivision of responsibilities.

It is great that we are discussing the Black Sea now, but I believe that we need to conclude this discussion with a concrete proposal. The Black Sea can contribute to the development of the Danube. The Danube region contributes to the development of the Black Sea. Both regions are interdependent. For this reason, I believe that a common approach should be considered. The issue that could bring an immediate result is energy. The new energy sources from the Caspian Sea, as well as the new routes, can develop the Black Sea region and, by implication, the Danube region.

The Commission responded by launching its Communication on Black Sea Synergy in 2007. While ensuring stability in the region, the Communication meets the needs of applicant States which are seeking both a Euro-Atlantic anchoring and a framework of enhanced cooperation. The EU must continue in this direction. It should strengthen its involvement in the Black Sea in order to give positive proof of its ‘soft power’ diplomacy.

      <p sl="de">The report on an EU strategy for the Black Sea is important and for this reason, it is rightly very comprehensive. The further development of synergy in the Black Sea region is significant not just for energy strategy reasons. We need new impulses for the modernisation of the economic area and new enterprise initiatives in the Black Sea region. It is particularly important that natural gas supplies for Europe should be secured. However, whatever the efforts by the EU, Russian interests should not be forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="de">Russia is a vital strategic partner if peaceful and prosperous development is to be assured for the Black Sea region. Criticising the prolonged stationing of the Russian Black Sea fleet represents an unnecessary provocation. Nonetheless, I have voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Another reason why the report is important is because of its references to the Black Sea’s importance as a natural resource and the environmental situation in this region. A fact that should not be ignored is that an unprecedented increase in fish mortality has been noted recently in the Black Sea. The biggest polluters affecting the marine biodiversity are the Dnieper, Don, Dniester and Danube rivers (which spill 60 000 tonnes of phosphorous and 340 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the Black Sea every year). Other factors that contribute to the degradation of the Black Sea are excessive fishing and waste materials. A group of experts estimated that subaquatic life will completely disappear from the Black Sea in approximately 30 years due to hydrogen sulphide. I believe that these issues should be as high as possible on the European agenda.</p>

      <p sl="de">In 2007, the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU was recognised. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, part of the Black Sea became an inland sea of the EU. As developments in this region, which is geopolitically situated between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, also have an impact on EU internal affairs, there is a need for stronger involvement in the area. The aim is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region, as well as within the region. The Black Sea region is intended to be developed into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity. In addition, joint projects are being set up, such as the creation of a Black Sea Civil Society Forum, strengthening of the academic and students’ networks and creation of an Institute for European Studies in the Black Sea region. I have therefore voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Black Sea region is an important one for the European Union, and a region which requires an integrated approach and greater visibility of EU action in the future. The region needs democratic measures to be put in place, intended chiefly to ensure security, stability and peace, as well as to increase prosperity. The objective of the strategy is also to ensure the EU’s energy security. In the context of shaping a strategy for the Black Sea macro-region, and then for the Danube region, the proposal put forward by the European Commission in 2007 entitled ‘Black Sea Synergy – A New Regional Cooperation Initiative’ (which recognised the region as strategic for the EU) is the best method of dealing with the abovementioned issues. Unfortunately, Black Sea Synergy results have so far been rather limited. Furthermore, no clear and comprehensive picture exists of the current implementation results, in view of which the criticism is increasingly being made that the EU lacks a coherent vision and that the strategy is too fragmented. Therefore, as the rapporteur says, while building upon the merits of the Black Sea Synergy, the EU strategy for the Black Sea should put in place a stronger policy framework and boost EU involvement in the Black Sea region. Just as with the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the Danube region, success in implementation will depend on good dialogue at all levels of regional cooperation, because this dialogue will lead to proposals for appropriate and regular reporting, monitoring, evaluation and follow-up mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="it">The strategic importance of the Black Sea region has now been recognised since 2007: with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU, the Black Sea began to have a direct impact on the Union’s internal affairs, which is why there needs to be greater EU involvement in the area. In my opinion, the implementation of a strategy to develop greater cooperation between the EU and the region is a goal that the Union should set itself as soon as possible. This initiative, called the Black Sea Synergy, could transform the region into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity. In line with this House, I gave my assent – through my vote in favour – to supporting the creation and launch of the Black Sea Synergy. I believe the economic, social and cultural development of the region can be promoted, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, by further liberalising trade and intensifying commerce within the region. In the context of development and greater integration between the Member States, by giving my assent, I encourage the growth and development of the Black Sea region by means of an action plan containing clear objectives and flagship initiatives.</p>

We believe that the strategy will make for effective coordination of activities and division of tasks. As well as this, the EP reiterates its call on the Commission and the EEAS to carry out regular reviews of the implementation of the strategy by establishing concrete monitoring, evaluation, follow-up and reporting mechanisms, and urges that the relevant European Parliament committees be consulted at key stages of this process.</p>

      <p sl="it">As a result of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union in 2007, some parts of the shores of the Black Sea became part of Europe. In the same year, a new European policy called Black Sea Synergy was created, which works to promote stability, security, democracy and prosperity in the region.</p>
      <p sl="it">As early as 2008, the European Parliament expressed its support for the creation of the Synergy and also asked for the elaboration of a detailed Action Plan for the area with a number of concrete objectives to be reached. Unfortunately, so far, the project seems to have been a partial failure, partly as a result of the lack of visibility of the funds made available. A specific budget line must therefore be created for it as soon as possible. It should provide clear rules for disbursing funds, so that the requirements and the specific characteristics of the region can be focused upon.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to involve the local authorities, business communities and non-governmental organisations present in the territory to a greater extent. The potential for economic and social growth in the Black Sea region must be developed, starting with areas such as lifelong learning and the adjustment of education to labour market requirements, as well as planning an inter-regional trade strategy capable of increasing the volume of international trade.</p>

      <p sl="en">The strategic importance of the Black Sea in terms of energy, trade and transport can sometimes mean that environmental concerns are sidelined. In its 2007 communication on the Black Sea Synergy, the Commission stated that ‘Community accession to the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution is a priority’. In 2008, the Commission confirmed that it was ‘examining the conditions for European Community accession’. The report we voted on today reaffirms the importance of this convention, and I would like to reiterate the need for the Commission to continue towards full EU accession to it. We must work with other partners under this framework to ensure full implementation of the environmental protection measures which the region desperately needs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Black Sea region is of major strategic importance for the European Union. This importance results from its geographical location, encompassing three Member States of the European Union, namely, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria, a candidate country, Turkey, and six partners, including Russia. Apart from this, the challenges with regard to security and energy supplies require the European Union to achieve greater involvement and commitment in its relations with the countries of this region. Therefore, I subscribe to the concerns expressed in the document voted on today, which fall into two categories: to guarantee peace, democracy and stability in the Black Sea region and to guarantee the security of the European Union’s energy supply. I believe that from a regional point of view, it is necessary to create synergies and develop greater cooperation by establishing a more effective partnership with regard to transport and energy, with a view to greater diversification of supply channels and sources. The strengthening of the dialogue between the European Union and the Black Sea region will certainly be advantageous, since the different parties will be able to benefit from more effective cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="de">I supported the report on EU strategy in the Black Sea region. The measures previously taken in the Eastern European Mediterranean were not coordinated and the results achieved have been marginal. The Black Sea region has known bilateral conflict for many, many years. In view of the fact that two EU Member States border the Black Sea and the region has therefore become one of the Union’s direct neighbours, the European Union must engage more closely in regional dialogue in order to foster political stability in the region. Cooperation in establishing regional structures will also benefit the environmental situation, which is currently a cause for considerable concern. The EU needs to provide active support in order to influence the balance between economic development and environmental protection. After all, Europe also has interests that it pursues in the Black Sea region. The area is an integral part of the EU’s energy strategy, so that this new strategy is an implementation of the higher energy strategy and will bring synergy and continuity to our work at European level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is a fundamental struggle going on in Pakistan and the extremism that we have seen has to end, especially the abusive blasphemy laws. These are leading to a climate of fear and intolerance and, in the worst cases, extremism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fight against extremism is not an easy task, which is why the Pakistani Government and all those citizens who agree that intolerance and extremism are unacceptable need our support. We have to continue to wipe out terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Governor, Mr Taseer, was violently murdered out of sheer intolerance by a guard from his own security detail, a person who should have protected him. His daughter, Shehrbano, wrote a letter which was published in The New York Times , from which I would like to quote, because I think she gets to the essence and it is very good to use her words in memory of her father.</p>
      <p sl="en">She says of the perpetrator: ‘Mr Qadri and his supporters may have felled a great oak that day, but they are sadly mistaken if they think they have succeeded in silencing my father’s voice or the voices of millions like him who believe in the secular vision of Pakistan’s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah’. She continues: ‘There are those who say my father’s death was the final nail in the coffin for a tolerant Pakistan. That Pakistan’s liberal voices will now be silenced. But we buried a heroic man, and not the courage he inspired in others’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Others followed in their condemnation of the blasphemy laws, even conservative politicians. We have to support that here in the European Parliament. The daughter of Governor Taseer went to Smith College and she studied European politics and human rights, but too many people in Pakistan are educated in madrasahs. We have to make sure that the young generation has opportunities, and learns how to live together in the diverse society which is Pakistan.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, several weeks after the governing coalition in Pakistan was on the verge of collapse, the country was rocked by the shooting, in broad daylight, of the Governor of Punjab. Salmaan Taseer was governor of the country’s wealthiest and most populous province, and was also an important politician in the ruling party. He died because he had the moral strength and the courage to demand the release of the Christian woman Asia Bibi, who has been sentenced to death for blasphemy. His murder, carried out by one of his own security guards and inspired by Muslim extremists, is not just another attack on a highly placed politician in Pakistan and proof of the dramatically low level of security there. It is, principally, testimony to the increasingly visible slide of the country – of Pakistan – towards a situation in which part of the armed forces, the judiciary and the political elite support, both openly and secretly, a policy of concessions towards Islamic political and religious extremists.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Yesterday, in this Chamber, we debated the subject of the persecution of Christians. Today, we have adopted a resolution on the matter. It seems to me that scope for activity is opening up for Mrs Ashton and her service to put diplomatic and political pressure on the Pakistani authorities, who must at last start to fight religious extremism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it was shocking, but sadly not surprising, to receive the news that Governor Taseer has been murdered. I personally knew Benazir Bhutto, and Minister Shahbaz Bhatti has become a good friend of mine. What links all three of them is their amazing courage as vocal and visible critics of blasphemy laws and their abuse by extremist groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government of Pakistan has indeed taken several important steps to improve the rights of minorities, for example, by allocating a minimum quota in public jobs. The government has also formed a committee to review all discriminatory laws, including the blasphemy law. However, the work has not yet finished. Despite several major steps, so long as there is a legal loophole, such as that in the current blasphemy law, so massive that it enables terrorists and extremists to push their own agenda forward, it is difficult to believe in a true commitment to democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that, with this resolution, we can express our continuing solidarity with the government of Pakistan in the fight against terrorism and the spread of extremism.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, exactly eight months ago, on 20 May, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on religious freedom in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Today, this subject has returned to our Chamber again, as a result of the religiously motivated sentence of death handed down to 45 year old Asia Bibi and the murder of the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, who had spoken out publicly in her defence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It turns out that the situation we described eight months ago has not only failed to improve, but has become yet worse. In Pakistan, today, one can lose one’s life both for so-called religious blasphemy and for freedom of speech – in this case, a public statement about a judicial sentence. The murder of Mr Taseer shows how delicate a situation we face. Pakistan is divided by religion to such an extent, that on both sides – Christian and Muslim – people are dying, including the representatives of local elites. Public support for amendment of the Pakistan Penal Code and, in particular, of Section 295 C, which prescribes capital punishment for blasphemy, can also involve the risk of death.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should, however, require courage from Pakistani politicians and, in particular, from the opposition, for example, the Pakistan Muslim League, which is blocking government reform of the code. We can also support the work of the Ministry for Minority Affairs and help the government of Prime Minister Gilani in such matters as improving the quality of journalism and media reporting and the standard of educational materials in schools, for example. Today, the European Parliament is not interfering in Pakistan’s internal affairs, but is only calling attention to Article 20 of Pakistan’s 1973 Constitution and the freedom of religion for which it provides.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to open this speech by saying that I read with much interest the joint resolution on Pakistan and, in particular, on the assassination of Governor Taseer. It offers a strange contrast to the resolution which was adopted this morning on Christian minorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of us here are committed, or so I hope, to protecting freedom of expression, conscience and religion. What we should be equally preoccupied with are all those who fall victim to persecution because of their religious choices, including when they decide to change religion and also when they do not believe in God.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want to combat fundamentalism, of whatever kind that may be, then we must treat all victims of this fundamentalism in the same way. No religion is, or ever was, invulnerable to what I will call intolerable deviations. Just let us remind ourselves of the mass murder of American Indians, particularly in the Caribbean and in Latin America. Let us remind ourselves of the sorrowful period of the Crusades, the Inquisition or the wars of religion between Catholics and Protestants. Let us remember the anti-Semitism which had such devastating effects during the 20th century and which lives on more or less latently in a number of EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Every religion has its own form of fundamentalism and the first victims of such fundamentalism are often the religious moderates of those same religions. From this perspective, the assassination of the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, is a classic example. This man was murdered because he was a model of tolerance and because he dared to condemn the blasphemy laws in force in his country and the abusive usage of these by certain extremist groups in cases such as that of Asia Bibi, a Christian sentenced to death for blasphemy under the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is even more unacceptable is the praising of his murderer by fanatical groups. Let us not forget that the blasphemy law is applied primarily to Muslims, that it affects all religious minorities, and, in particular, women, but also trade-union activists, journalists and lawyers, and that people from all of these groups are also frequently deprived of their fundamental freedoms, if not obliged to go into hiding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore time that the Commission and the External Action Service changed their policy, and I would like you, Commissioner, to provide an accurate assessment of the agreement with Tunisia and the agreement with Pakistan on democracy and human rights, and I would like Tunisia to be a lesson to us, to be a lesson to you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of Punjab put in place by the government of Pakistan, and we are remembering here today his clear support for Asia Bibi – a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are rightly distressed by his murder and the reaction to it by part of the population of Pakistan, but we should not forget, as well, that many have mourned him and have done that in public as a public act. It is an act we should be commending, like, for example, the action taken by the media regulator against certain media with regard to their coverage of the alleged murderer.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as we know, the blasphemy law in Pakistan puts the lives of Pakistani citizens at risk: Muslim, Christian and others alike, as many speakers have said this afternoon. We are aware that Pakistan is a new democracy, that it is facing conflict on its borders, and that it has faced the disaster of the recent flood, as well as the earthquake only this week. We know that the government is struggling, but we also recognise that it needs our support in terms of developing democracy within Pakistan, not least in the political battle against extremism and for universal human rights, and it is our role as democratic parliamentarians to support all those who are working for positive change and to give them the voice that others would deny them.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan, not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – which they ratified with a large number of reservations – and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan. We want them, as well, to continue the efforts to change the blasphemy law because this is a law that is more abused than properly used.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the murder of Salmaan Taseer basically reflects the religious intolerance that prevails in Pakistani society. Taseer was one of those rare people that dared to speak out against Pakistan’s Blasphemy Law. He had asked the President to pardon Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy, and had also visited her in prison. The fate of a citizen who opposes injustice is harsh and cruel in today’s Pakistan. Will Asia Bibi’s fate be the same if she is pardoned? Will they murder her too?</p>
      <p sl="fi">We might well ask whether a state like Pakistan should enjoy the trade benefits that the European Union offers. Parliament should make respect for human rights a fundamental element when the EU is debating the regulation on emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan.</p>

It seems to me that it is necessary, here, to say something about the unacceptable toleration being shown towards those Muslim imams who make public calls in Pakistan – in Peshawar for example – for killings, offering, for example, to reward the perpetrators financially.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, to make a personal statement, I spent a lot of time with Salmaan Taseer when we were both in our twenties. Indeed, we were friends. Salmaan wrote to me at Parliament to invite me to stay as his personal guest at the Governor’s house in the Punjab. That letter arrived after Governor Taseer’s murder.</p>
      <p sl="en">Salmaan was a man of charm, charisma and high intelligence. He was also very capable and effective. He represented the best tradition of Pakistan – a devout Muslim but not in any way fundamentalist. As has been said, Salmaan strongly supported a Christian lady who had been sentenced under blasphemy laws. Salmaan paid for that support with his life. It was a political assassination.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pakistan is not only a large, developing country. It is a country with over 20 nuclear warheads. I came here today, first and foremost, to express my profound sorrow, but I must also express my concern – all our concern – for Pakistan.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the violent death of the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, who was always a proponent of religious tolerance, brings the strengthening of extremist forces to the eyes of the world. Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets after this atrocity, marching not against the murder but in support of the person who committed it. Mr Taseer spoke out vehemently against the blasphemy laws, which prescribe the death sentence for blasphemers. Just recently, as some of my fellow Members have already mentioned, the Christian, Asia Bibi, has been sentenced to death for supposedly having insulted the prophet Mohammed.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a moderate member of the PPP political party, Salmaan Taseer was one of the strongest voices against extremism. His death weakens the government, which is already fighting for political survival following the withdrawal of a coalition partner. There are only 3 million Christians in Pakistan’s population of 160 million. What fate awaits this always peaceable minority?</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe must intervene here and the delegation for relations with the countries of Southeast Asia, of which I am Vice-President, will continue to give its full backing to the human rights movement. This murder must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrator and the people behind him must be brought to justice.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, yes, the situation in Pakistan is particularly complicated, both due to internal and external factors, and therefore, events like a political assassination for religious reasons, and of such an important figure, immediately rock the entire country and the whole of society. After such shocks, events in the country may take a dangerous turn towards strengthening religious fanaticism and restricting human rights. Our resolution should help to ensure that there is nevertheless a different course of events, and that even in this situation, the Pakistani Government can still find the strength to go down the road of bolstering human rights and opposing religious fanaticism. We must provide significant support to such steps, as well as, undoubtedly, the independence and protection of the judiciary in complex cases concerning blasphemy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I have expressed my firm support on several occasions when it came to taking strong action in defence of human rights in the EU’s relations with third countries. I do so again in relation to the events that transpired in Pakistan, as such a position conveys the message that Europe does not abandon those who raise their voice in support of tolerance, freedom of religion and the equal treatment of minorities. We are well aware that the persecution of Christians exists in many countries. Not only in Pakistan would there be a need for leaders like the late Salmaan Taseer. For this reason, the European Union must take every opportunity to express the importance of its common values with a single voice through the European External Action Service. One such common value is the freedom of religion. If we do not speak out against the atrocities committed against Christians or other religious minorities, we cannot take our own faith seriously either.</p>

      <p sl="it">The division between Christians and Muslims is increasingly clear, but the law on blasphemy is still at the root of many acts that violate fundamental freedoms. Anyone who opposes or merely expresses their disapproval of this rule, as the Governor of Punjab did, is suppressed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when Governor Salmaan Taseer was buried, it seemed to me as though any hope for a moderate, stable Pakistan was buried with him. This disgusting murder of a dedicated and enlightened public servant was sparked by his advocacy of reforming Pakistan’s draconian blasphemy laws. In particular, he championed the case of a Christian woman who is currently awaiting execution – would you believe it – having been convicted of defaming Islam.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in this Parliament have long called for the reform or scrapping of these wretched blasphemy laws, which are invoked frequently against Pakistan’s religious minorities. This assassination underlines the growing radicalisation of Pakistani society. Jinnah, were he alive today, would be shocked.</p>
      <p sl="en">Few mainstream politicians dared to follow Salmaan Taseer’s lead and suggest a reform of the blasphemy laws and even fewer will be able to do so now. They will be afraid. Instead, the violent radicals and fanatics – including, I am afraid, leading jurists – praised the assassin and called for his release. They seem to be winning the battle of ideas in Pakistan. As a result, domestic terrorism is flourishing, and we saw this phenomenon again last week.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are talking here about a double tragedy: firstly, the execution of an innocent man and, secondly, done by someone who was supposed to be minding him, his bodyguard. I can empathise and sympathise with the family in particular, because only a week ago, we had a similar experience in difference circumstances, where a beautiful 27-year-old girl from Ireland on her honeymoon in Mauritius was killed in her own bedroom when she walked in on staff who were robbing her room. They strangled her, threw her into the bath and tried to pretend it was suicide. Circumstances are different but the result is the same: an innocent person dead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, a few weeks ago, I was part of the EU-US delegation to America and there we met the Foreign Minister of Pakistan. He struck me as being a very reasonable, sensible, fair-minded person and he emphasised that religion is about tolerance and we should try to get that message through to the extremists and the fundamentalists.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, what is particularly alarming about the murder of the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, is the background to this violent act.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The fact that this murder took place with the silent approval of Pakistani spiritual leaders, and that local lawyers support the murderer, means that murder on grounds of religious intolerance is tolerated in Pakistani society. Pakistani laws on blasphemy make it possible to persecute religious minorities with the threat of the death penalty, as has happened to Asia Bibi, a mother of five children who is awaiting her punishment in prison.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We therefore really cannot remain indifferent to what is happening. Our pressure on the Pakistani administration is quite legitimate and I expect a similar response from all free and democratic forces around the world. We cannot today tolerate – in the third millennium – brutal behaviour from the middle ages perpetrated by oppressors in an abuse of religion.</p>

Pakistan’s problems must not be viewed as something far away, since we know all too well that the problems arising in the region of Inner Asia, whether they are economic problems, ethnic problems or even the issue of emigration, will sooner or later ripple over to the area of the European Union. Thus, there is a very real need for us to address the problem of Pakistan. Pakistan is burdened by two problems in particular: on the one hand, the continuous attacks from Afghanistan and India, and, on the other, the issue which is the most important for us in this sitting, Muslim extremists, to whom Salmaan Taseer also fell victim.

Salmaan Taseer paid with his life in the defence not only of religious freedom, but also of the life and freedom of others.

      <p sl="en">Instead of doing all we can to combat Islamic fundamentalism taking deeper root in Europe, we placate and appease it. Sharia law is now recognised in some tribunals in the UK. There are inner city areas where the de facto writ of Sharia law runs. Europe, having produced the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution and the wonders of the modern scientific age, now lies supine before a 6th century ideology.</p>

He was a prominent figure in the political life of Pakistan who was noted for his courageous fight against extremism, intolerance and fanaticism. Seven months ago, I supported here the need to urgently revise the provisions relating to offences against religions in the so-called ‘blasphemy laws’.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to remind you that the possibilities for abuse offered by these laws create an atmosphere of intolerance that encourages violence on religious grounds and also promotes discrimination, intimidation and persecution of religious minorities. The case of Asia Bibi that actually culminated in the murder of Governor Taseer is symbolic in this regard. I believe that the Pakistani authorities must demonstrate through action their declared commitment to the fight against extremism in this country by abolishing the blasphemy laws.

The fact that Islamist extremist groups continue to exist directly inside the Pakistani security services does not contribute to the stability of the country, and clearly undermines confidence in the country being governed by the laws of a legal state. I hope that the reform process will go further in the country, and I would therefore like to call on all political forces, including religious institutions, to provide greater support for moderation, tolerance and mutual respect between communities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in many ways, Pakistan is a fragile country.

It is economically fragile because the global financial crisis and the devastating floods in the country have set back its development by several years. It is socially fragile because social structures have failed to develop over the decades in such a way as to enable large sections of society to share in economic development.</p>

The fact remains, however, that religions are often misused for ideological purposes, which is something that we need to combat. This is the case in Pakistan, for example.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, we must remember that Pakistan was created on the basis of religious criteria when India was partitioned. It is a country with no history, but was established as a Muslim state by the British colonial powers as they pulled out of the region. That is why we should understand that this is an Islamic state. However, we must insist that this country should be organised along tolerant lines and that religious freedom should be upheld. Christians must be treated with greater respect than has been the case to date and the EU needs to show greater vigour in stepping up to its role as an advocate for this group.

Taseer was a supporter of the democratic state and spoke out against Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws, saying that they were enacted by human beings and were therefore capable of being amended by them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Several here have already spoken of how he vigorously defended a Christian woman who had been sentenced to death and tried to overturn her sentence.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate is yet more proof that the European Union is shocked by the brutal murder of Mr Salmaan Taseer, Governor of Pakistan’s Punjab province, in Islamabad on 4 January. High Representative Ashton strongly condemned the killing in her statement on 4 January. She urged the Pakistani authorities to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. This assassination is all the more distressing as, based on available reports, it is linked to Mr Taseer’s outspoken defence of a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, who was sentenced to death under questionable blasphemy charges.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should be noted that on 12 November 2010, High Representative Ashton expressed deep concern over the death sentence given to Mrs Asia Bibi. She called on Pakistan to abolish the death penalty and respect human rights, as guaranteed under the international conventions to which the country is a party.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has repeatedly brought up the continued application of the blasphemy laws with the government of Pakistan as part of this human rights dialogue. We are conscious of the fact that the blasphemy laws in their present form are open to abuse and have often been applied against religious minorities. We are also aware that false accusations have been used as a tool to settle private disputes or for personal gain.</p>
      <p sl="en">We were encouraged by earlier steps taken by the government of Pakistan to try amending more controversial aspects of the laws. Ideally, of course, the blasphemy laws would be totally repealed. It is unfortunate that in the case of Mr Taseer’s assassination, there has been widespread public support for the murderer. We are concerned that fatwas were not only issued against Mr Taseer but also against other public figures who have spoken out for a reform of the blasphemy laws. Inciting hatred and violence with impunity should not be allowed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government of Pakistan has a responsibility to protect its citizens, and we count on it to do everything possible to ensure their safety. There are fears that the murder of Mr Taseer reflects a rise in extremism and intolerance in Pakistan. We need to face up to the situation and consider carefully how to react, knowing that the government, and democratic institutions of the states more generally, continue to face daunting challenges. Let me be very clear here: there is no alternative but to continue to strengthen democratic and progressive forces in Pakistan’s civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pakistan’s constitution explicitly protects the rights of minorities, and accordingly, the government needs to tackle extremism not just in the border areas but also on the streets of Pakistani cities. We need to provide continued emphasis on education in our development cooperation and more needs to be done to promote tolerance within the educational system, especially towards minorities. We are well aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan; this does not just concern Christians but also Hindus, Shias, Ahmadis and others. The European Union should champion their common cause and not that of any particular group or religion, as this would play into the hands of those wishing to deepen divisions among Christians and Muslims.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will continue to focus on the need to fully protect every individual’s right to religious freedom in Pakistan or elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to express my deep indignation at the murder of the Governor of the province of Punjab in Pakistan, Salmaan Taseer, on 4 January 2011, for having spoken out against Pakistan’s law against blasphemy. According to the values of our Western societies, murder is considered as the worst single crime. It is, therefore, difficult to understand how someone can commit murder as a form of retaliation. Freedom of conscience and freedom of religion are as important as freedom of speech, which may lead to conflicts between these freedoms. However, any definition by governments of what is to be considered as blasphemy is an unacceptable restriction on freedom of speech. A modern society should consider as legitimate all personal views expressed in an inoffensive manner. Moreover, if Pakistan is to become a tolerant society, such barbarian acts motivated by religious fundamentalism are to be condemned. This incident is yet another reminder that freedom of speech continues to be absent in some regions of the world. Given the history of his country, it was courageous for Salmaan Taseer to speak out against the blasphemy law and in favour of free speech. It is regrettable that this ultimately cost him his life.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the truth is that I have made no attempt to conceal my discomfort with the issue and the situation, as I do genuinely believe that we are faced with an important issue. However, it is an issue that affects both Italy and Brazil and there are many forums in which I believe we must tackle the issue. However, I am not convinced that this forum, which is for discussing resolutions on violations of human rights throughout the world, is the right one.</p>
      <p sl="es">I say this with the utmost respect, and from the outset, I offer my complete solidarity with all victims of terrorism in all corners of the world, not least this one. I say it in order to encourage general reflection on how these types of issue end up being discussed on a Thursday afternoon session, when, and I stress this point, in this context, we have a sub judice situation with a resolution already in place.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this resolution, we are appealing to the European institutions to play a role in affirming the rights of justice and legality as they carry out their diplomatic functions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, the European Parliament is asking loud and clear that the Charter of Fundamental Rights not be regarded as just a collection of papers, and that citizens not be seen as mere consumers of the common market, but as holders of inalienable and non-negotiable fundamental rights. The relations of the victims of Cesare Battisti – who killed four decent, hard-working people in a senseless bloodbath in front of their families and children – came here yesterday in this spirit of trust.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, with passion and the force of the law behind us, we are relying on everyone to do their part and, in these last few seconds, I should like to ask my fellow Members to dedicate a minute of reflection to the memory of the victims.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today in this Chamber to remember that the European Parliament and democratic institutions must protect and support the relatives of the victims of terrorism and provide the sense of justice that European public opinion demands.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the resolution we have tabled and are shortly to vote upon, we point out that relations between Brazil and the European Union are based on mutual recognition and respect of the rule of law and of fundamental rights. There are therefore no question marks over our friendly relationship with Brazil.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to point out that, in Italy, the defendant, Cesare Battisti, has been found guilty of four murders. Although a fugitive, Mr Battisti had the legal assurances in his trials – which were all conducted in the presence of his defence lawyer – that the Italian justice system had run its course, with all levels of justice exhausted, and that they sentenced him to two life sentences.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, even France – where Cesare Battisti had previously fled – decided back in 2004 to accept Italy’s extradition request, recognising his crimes and the corresponding sentences, because Cesare Battisti is a criminal who must be brought to justice. Brazil’s contradictory behaviour is difficult to understand, not least because the Brazilian authorities have not officially recognised him as a political refugee, which is one of the reasons to suspend the bilateral agreement between Italy and Brazil regarding extradition.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why the decision of the Supreme Court seemed incomprehensible to the victims’ families and the wider public. Mr President, we are representing a Europe of rights and of rights for all. The victims have the right to know that those guilty of such heinous crimes will serve their sentence in the prisons of their own countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am not Italian, I am not Brazilian, I am a citizen of a Member State of the European Union, and I do not want the Union to be a Union which has lost its sense of proportion – a Union in which a criminal enjoys the same rights as the victims of crimes and their families. This is not acceptable. It is a question of certain elementary standards – I would even say human standards – and not European ones. Speaking as someone who is not very emotionally involved and who, I suppose, can look at the situation coldly and objectively, it seems to me I can say on this matter that a certain loss of balance has, in fact, occurred here, which is inconceivable to our taxpayers and our voters. I think the decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court is incomprehensible and will be incomprehensible to everyone who looks into it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Romeva i Rueda, yesterday in a touching press conference held in Parliament, the relatives of the victims of the indiscriminate murders of Cesare Battisti spoke fairly and with dignity to once again present the issue at the heart of this tragic affair.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not a matter of revenge, but justice must be done. Therefore, because justice must be done, Cesare Battisti must be extradited, and because Mr Battisti must be extradited, we hope that through this resolution, Parliament can authoritatively and credibly amplify this same cry: it is not a matter of revenge, but justice must be done.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union is a political project in which we have combined our values and our ideals to definitively defeat the power of ideologies, totalitarian ideologies, arbitrary violence and the limitless evil of terrorism.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it happens all too often that intellectuals or high-powered institutions in some countries refuse to understand the phenomenon of Italian terrorism, raising doubts about the trustworthiness of our judicial system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Since this is the legal basis for the refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti, we cannot but reject it. Cesare Battisti, an individual with something of an ambiguous past, is the product of a time in which thousands of young people – many of whom were desperately lonely – chose armed struggle as a means of political struggle and ended up turning the alienating utopian dream they believed in into a crime. Other countries have experienced similar tragedies but none have so far offered the protagonists of these any chances to reform, unlike Italy, which, in fighting terrorism, really cemented its sense of national unity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Taking up the appeal of the victims’ relatives, we therefore ask for Cesare Battisti to be brought before the Italian judicial system, which will know how to show – as it has done in hundreds of other cases of former terrorists who are now reintegrated into social and civil life – that to be punished is also to make amends, as the Italian, Cesare Beccaria, taught Western legal civilisation, and not just intimidation or brutalisation, as the Brazilian authorities fear.</p>

      <p sl="pt">If you want to talk about Brazil, then it would be a matter of true urgency to demonstrate our solidarity with the people affected by the storms that recently lashed the state of Rio de Janeiro, in particular, the cities of Nova Friburgo, Petrópolis and Teresópolis, which killed more than 700 people, left more than 13 000 people homeless, and caused incalculable damage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is lamentable that the European Parliament has not commented on this tragedy and has not asked the European Commission to express its active solidarity to the President of Brazil and its availability to provide any aid necessary. Therefore, from these seats, we congratulate the new President of Brazil, Dilma Roussef, on her recent election. We send our feelings of solidarity and deep regret for the tragic consequences of the storms, feelings that extend to the Brazilian Congress, the families that are the victims of this tragedy and all the people of Brazil.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the resolution presented here, we insist on the need to respect the decisions of the legitimate authorities of Brazil, where Cesare Battisti is being held, and to await the decisions of the legitimate authorities of Brazil, without pressure from this Parliament.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cesare Battisti is not a romantic hero as some have depicted him, but a savage murderer with a history of robbery who has been found guilty of killing four people with shots to the back of the neck.</p>
      <p sl="it">He benefited unjustly from Mr Mitterrand’s doctrine of political asylum and has been protected and idealised by some left-wing French intellectuals. Having fled to Brazil to avoid repatriation and prison, Mr Battisti was saved by President Lula due to an erroneous decision that was probably made for political reasons, with no regard for the suffering of the victims and their relatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Figueiredo, Parliament’s request to the Brazilian authorities and to the Commission does not only ask for the respect of legal rules and bilateral agreements, but also aims to affirm the principle that no ideological reason can justify the actions of a murderer and no country may guarantee him impunity.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must never forget that there is ethical value in the moral compensation of victims by serving a punishment. This is at the foundation of the social contract that props up all communities that are civilised, or that aim to be.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 31 years after the blood spilled by the victims of the barbaric murders carried out by Cesare Battisti and his gang, it has still not been forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="it">The pain of the victims’ relatives, whom we heard from yesterday in a press conference in Strasbourg, is genuine proof of this. Indeed, it was Mr Mastella – then Minister for Justice in the Italian Government – who made major efforts through institutional actions to give final justice to the Battisti case.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, together with the relatives of the victims, the citizens of Italy and the whole country, it is the European Parliament – showing its extraordinary unity with a joint motion for a resolution – that is forcefully asking another country, which is a friend of Europe and a friend of Italy, for the immediate extradition of Cesare Battisti, who is a criminal and a terrorist and who has been convicted with definitive judgments, so as to finally bring to an end this difficult and painful episode that has been dragging on for too long.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘By himself, he was a petty crook or a minor felon, but he was bright and like me, he also believed he could become a politician. The people most emotionally and physically wounded by the crimes of his gang have never asked for revenge but, most civilly, even now, they ask for truth and justice. Not because it is a life sentence, but because the judgment has been made and so that the punishment decided upon according to the rules of our legal system may be respected and carried out’. Those are the words of Arrigo Cavallina, who recruited Cesare Battisti in prison when he was serving a sentence for robbery, talking about Mr Battisti, his crimes and the families of the victims.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the very essence of the entire affair: he was a common criminal, who reinvented himself as a terrorist and who has been sentenced to life in prison for carrying out or ordering the murders of four defenceless people, having sheltered first in Mexico, then France, and now in Brazil, protected by a network of international support as if he were a romantic revolutionary and not a ruthless murderer.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why the extradition of Cesare Battisti to Italy is not just the latest act in a long history of presumed political persecution, as some armchair intellectuals would still have us believe, but the legitimate claim of a Member – not to mention founding – State of the European Union to have the international treaties and its own judicial system respected.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union really must ensure that the treaty signed between Brazil and Italy, which aims to regulate the terms and procedures of cooperation in matters of extradition, is respected.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Brazilian Supreme Court has granted the extradition of Cesare Battisti, who has been found guilty in some seven trials and sentenced in absentia to four life sentences for as many murders, with definitive judgments issued by the Italian judicial authorities. Incredibly, the outgoing President of Brazil has refused to deliver this criminal to Italy. Furthermore, in an act of extreme contempt for our country, a group of left-wing Brazilian members of parliament went to visit Cesare Battisti in prison and took photos of themselves celebrating with him.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union, which has excellent commercial and economic relations with Brazil, cannot but intervene to enforce the law and the right of the victims’ relatives to justice. Just yesterday, the victims’ relatives met Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, who – for once – were all in agreement, irrespective of their political affiliation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of the outgoing Brazilian President’s recent decision to refuse extradition of an Italian citizen, Mr Battisti, sentenced in absentia to a life sentence and several other terms of prison by the Italian court.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have taken due note of your views on this particular case, and I share your feelings towards the victims and their families. However, the Commission considers that there is no scope for its involvement in this case. The European Union has not concluded any extradition agreement with Brazil and, even if this had been the case, it would have no right to intervene in individual extradition cases. A decision on extradition between European Union Member States, or between European Union Member States and third states, are entirely the preserve of the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Italy’s relations with Brazil on criminal cooperation are governed by a bilateral extradition treaty concluded in 1989. The Brazilian authorities have used their discretionary power within the law to refuse extradition of Mr Battisti.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to add, in no uncertain terms: in the case of extradition, I have no doubts that Italian justice delivers the high standards expected of European Union Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am against the initiative of this resolution, because I believe that the case of Cesare Battisti’s extradition does not have a place in a debate in this House on urgent cases of ‘Breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law’, simply because it does not represent a breach of human rights, democracy or the rule of law in Brazil and also because it is not an urgent matter. This is a legal and political dispute between Brazil and Italy and a decision by the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil is pending. At this time, this House should be sending two other messages to Brazil: one of solidarity regarding the disaster in which more than 700 people lost their lives, and one of delight on account of the democratic election of President Dilma Rousseff. Brazil is, without doubt, a democratic country that has made significant progress in political, civil, social, economic and cultural affairs in the last decade and is a model in the fight against poverty and hunger, thanks to the government’s Zero Hunger and Family Allowance programmes.</p>

      <p sl="en">The rule of law must be upheld. The credibility of public institutions depends on it. Brazilian President Lula was authorised by the Brazilian Supreme Court to extradite Cesare Battisti, an Italian citizen convicted of four murders, among other charges. On 31 December 2009, President Lula’s last day in office, he refused to extradite Battisti to Italy. I expect the Brazilian authorities to make an apolitical unbiased final decision; a decision that upholds the rule of law. The rule of law is fundamental to Brazilian-EU relations. Our treaties are founded on the principles of human rights and fairness. I trust these principles to remain mutual.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, exactly one week ago, Nobel Prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, published a penetrating article in The Wall Street Journal about her friend, the Iranian human rights lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who had just been sentenced to eleven years’ imprisonment. Ebadi called for the West to pay greater attention to the Sotoudeh case and to all the brave human rights defenders in the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The debate in this House is part of the response to Ebadi’s urgent appeal. We cannot and shall not forget Nasrin Sotoudeh, nor her fellow fighters for fundamental rights in Iran. That will also be the message, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of the report that I hope to present on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the plenary sitting in March, and I count on all of you to vote in favour of it. A powerful, united European voice for the rights of the Iranian people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, once again, we are forced to speak about human rights in Iran, after Nasrin Sotoudeh was sentenced to 11 years in jail. She is banned from practising law, but let us serve justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Rule of Law is no longer practised or existent in Iran, and the judiciary is highly politicised. Defending human rights is now considered an act against national security. Nasrin Sotoudeh, lawyer and mother of two, is charged with acting against national security. She defended, among others, Zahra Bahrami, an Iranian-Dutch citizen who was sentenced to death before Dutch diplomats had talked to her, and in a climate of serious doubts about due process.</p>
      <p sl="en">As strong a woman as Nasrin Sotoudeh is and was, by standing for justice, we see a weak regime that represses its citizens instead of providing for their wellbeing. High Representative Ashton will be in Istanbul later this month in an attempt to bring the Iranian regime to cooperate with the international community on the nuclear issue. Economic sanctions have the same aim. I doubt they will render the desired result before disproportionately hurting the people of Iran who, as a result, become more and more dependent on the hard-line government.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, while I am sceptical about the impact of economic sanctions, I am confident that sanctions against individuals responsible for violating human rights through, for example, censorship, rape, torture and executions, will be an effective and necessary step to end impunity and to honour the justice that Nasrin Sotoudeh stood for. Human rights are clearly the Achilles heel of the Iranian regime.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it was my intention today to compare the Islamic Republic of Iran to Nazi Germany but I have to say that I think in many ways, it can be even worse. The mullahs have hanged 65 people so far this year. Ten were hanged yesterday: first, they were heavily fined and had their homes confiscated, and then each was mercilessly flogged before being dragged to the gallows. Eighty-seven people have been hanged in the past four weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ahmadinejad is a holocaust denier and a hater of the Jews; he says he wants to wipe Israel off the map and he is now building nuclear weapons that will enable him to do so. He and Khamenei preside over the ruthless suppression of the citizens of Iran, with hangings, torture, stoning to death, amputations and floggings all commonplace, and the execution of children, and even pregnant women, routine. Two prisoners in Mashhad had their hands amputated this week; two others have been sentenced to amputation and these verdicts will be carried out soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Anyone who tries to expose this evil is immediately targeted. Nasrin Sotoudeh is a case in point: a courageous human rights lawyer who has defended many of the innocent people unjustly sentenced and executed by this fascist regime. Her outrageous sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment for doing her job is an insult to humanity. The real criminals are the tyrants in Tehran and they will be held to account. They believe that their critics in the West are part of an international conspiracy to topple their regime. Well, I for one would sign up to that project today. Evil must never be allowed to prevail, and the sooner we can see freedom, democracy, humanity and women’s rights restored to Iran, the better it will be for the whole world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by asking for the immediate release of Nasrin Sotoudeh, we are urging the Union and its Member States to do more to liberate Iranian citizens and the world from one of the cruellest and most authoritarian regimes in history.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Islamic Republic of Iran is characterised not only by the threat it poses to world peace with a nuclear project capable of evoking the terror of nuclear war, but also by the illegitimacy of its elections; mass arrests of people requesting free elections; the killing of objectors; the rape and physical abuse of those who do not support the regime; the iniquity of judicial processes, where decisions can be predicted as soon as the accusations have been made; serious discrimination against women and homosexuals; and the absence of freedom of expression and of association. The conditions of Iranian prisoners in Camp Ashraf, where they are subjected to violence and even stoning, are absolutely incredible.</p>
      <p sl="it">Every day, at least two people, including children, are sentenced to death in Iran, and they are guilty of nothing more than of not pleasing the regime. Legal evidence is often created through the cruel and skilful use of brutal methods of torture. These criticisms are certainly not aimed at Islam, which is based on peace, but at the Iranian regime. The arrest and conviction of Nasrin Sotoudeh bring to light a new level of judicial deceit, since in this case, the attack and conviction are against a defender of the people, which means that citizens of Iran cannot even defend themselves.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, while Iran might be starting to open up on nuclear matters, we unfortunately must conclude that the door is clearly closed in this country when it comes to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The case of Nasrin Sotoudeh demonstrates this completely. She was punished for her work in support of human rights with an extremely harsh sentence: 11 years, banned from practising as a lawyer for 20 years and from leaving the country. This verdict was reached following a mockery of a trial.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This case is far from an isolated incident. It is part of a deliberate strategy by the Iranian regime to systematically silence human rights activists. A whole series of very harsh sentences are targeted at lawyers who are active in human rights matters, and we must show solidarity with these courageous people who support and take action on human rights in spite of threats, torture and imprisonment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have to stay that I deeply deplore the fact that we once more have to talk about Iran, but we have to. We really have to because the situation in Iran is gravely problematic and dramatic.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why it is important that this Parliament reiterates once again its call for the release of all prisoners of conscience, including all those who have been detained over the last year in connection with their peaceful – and I repeat, peaceful – political and human rights activities. This Parliament has to call again on the Iranian authorities to respect the internationally recognised rights to freedom of expression and assembly, and strongly condemn the extraordinarily harsh sentence against Nasrin Sotoudeh and to commend her for her courage and her engagement.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is also why this Parliament has to consider Mrs Sotoudeh, as well as her fellow human rights activists and prisoners of conscience, and demand her immediate release. We have to express our concern over the ever more frequently imposed sentence of a ban on leaving Iran, which can lead to the logical conclusion that staying in Iran is considered a punishment by the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to call on the authorities to combat the impunity of human rights violators within the security forces and also reiterate our demand for an independent investigation into allegations of extra-judicial executions since June’s disputed presidential elections and for alleged violators to be brought to justice. Evidently, we also have to strongly condemn the bomb attack in Chabahar and to express our condolences to the victims’ families and the injured.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I should like to say that we are seriously concerned about the persecution of certain religions and ethnic groups in Iran. We have to express our conviction, supported by recent European history, that peaceful and balanced social and political development can only be achieved by taking the cultural and social aspirations of differing regions into account.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Nasrin Sotoudeh gave us reason to talk about her in a previous European Parliament debate on the lack of protection of human rights in Iran, when, on 4 September 2010, she was arrested on charges of propaganda against the state, conspiracy and assembling to act against national security. She has been held for four months. Now, following a trial, this distinguished human rights defender and dedicated co-worker of Nobel Laureate, Shirin Ebadi, has been sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment followed by a 20-year ban on practising law and leaving Iran. Let us remember that long prison sentences have also been handed down to other political prisoners. The 26-year-old women’s rights activist, Shiva Nazar Ahari, has been sentenced to four years in prison and 74 lashes for the same crime.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We need to emphasise clearly our opposition to flagrant violations of what are fundamental human rights: freedom of association, freedom of expression, the right to freedom of thought and the right to a fair trial. Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has devoted her life to the fight to defend human rights – defending minors who have been sentenced to death and people accused of causing peaceful protests as well as working closely with the opposition – has become living proof of the human rights violations in Iran. The European Union cannot continue to be a passive observer of this uneven fight on the part of Iranian society against the regime.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we also support the demands for the immediate and unconditional release of Nasrin Sotoudeh and all prisoners of conscience in Iran. After the electoral fraud that kept the Ahmadinejad regime in power, thousands of Iranians paid the price of freedom for their courage in protesting against an increasingly repressive regime. Nasrin Sotoudeh was sentenced, after months of isolation and torture, to 11 years in prison because, as a lawyer and campaigner for human rights, she defended opponents of the Tehran government, including a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Along with numerous dissidents, dozens of journalists and bloggers who dared to exercise their basic freedom to express their own conscience are also suffering ill treatment in Iranian prisons. I believe that the European Union’s commitment to the release of these fighters for democracy should not only take the form of public protest, but also of concrete steps from the European External Action Service, with a view to mobilising the international community to exert increased common pressure to end these human rights violations in Iran.</p>

      <p sl="en">Yet again in this House, we find ourselves discussing the appalling human rights situation in that Islamic Republic. As a lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh has helped many opposition supporters who were detained and harassed following the rigged presidential election 18 months ago. She has also represented minors on death row, truly a heroic job in a country that executes children with alacrity. She was arrested in September last year on charges of spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security. Now she has been sentenced to 11 years in prison and banned from practising law for 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">She should be released immediately and unconditionally. I call upon the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to make that point.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are tackling yet another debate on the violation of human rights and democracy in Iran. This time, it is the case of a lawyer who protects human rights activists in Iran.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would place a bet today, Mr President, that in a few weeks’ time, we will be back in this Chamber to speak about another different case of all basic rights being violated in Iran.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the conviction of human rights activist, Nasrin Sotoudeh, reflects the fragility of the respect for human rights in Iran. Since the controversial re-election of President Ahmadinejad in June 2009, all protests have been brutally suppressed, thousands of citizens arrested and several hundred have already been convicted.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The harsh punishment received by Nasrin Sotoudeh of 11 years in prison resulted from the fact that, as a lawyer, she had defended numerous opponents of the regime who had been arrested during the demonstrations following the presidential elections. Moreover, she was reprimanded for interviews given to the foreign press during this period. We can see here a typical case of the violation of the right to freedom of expression, of the right of lawyers to practise their profession without pressure or duress, and also of the right of a defendant to an impartial trial.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is another matter which outrages European public opinion and which outrages the Members of this House. If we keep seeing situations in the same country which evidently violate human rights, we need to think about the structure and responsibility of that country. It can be seen clearly that respect for one’s own traditions and customs does not, however, go together with the acceptance of certain declared standards or European standards – I am thinking, here, of human rights. That is obvious. It is good that the European Parliament has taken up this matter. There is still a question, however, about political pressure, because that is, as it were, the next matter on which the European Parliament speaks, when we are talking about Iran, and is not achieving any great success.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, during the last debate on human rights violations in Iran, which took place in this Chamber barely four months ago, I said in my speech that five Iranian citizens every day are told they are soon to lose their lives under sentence of capital punishment. To this tragic statistic must also be added the sentences of many years in prison for Iranian lawyers who defend the victims of the country’s justice system. Those last two words should probably be put in inverted commas. Forty seven year-old Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was arrested on 4 September, tortured and who has now been sentenced to 11 years in prison, is an example of this.</p>

Shiva Nazar Ahari, co-founder of the Committee of Human Rights Reporters, has been given a sentence of four years in prison, Mohammad Seifzadeh has been given nine years in prison and a ban on practising law for 10 years, and Mohammad Oliyafar has received a year in prison just for representing his clients in court. I think that by using the negotiating position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, we should press for the subject of human rights defenders to be included in talks with Iran as a matter of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the case of the lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, is very serious. She has received 11 years in prison, has been banned from practising law and from leaving the country for 20 years. What has she done? She has defended Shirin Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, other political and human rights activists, journalists and minors sentenced to the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Since 2009, at least 15 human rights lawyers have received prison sentences in Iran. Through such measures, Iran violates fundamental human rights and fundamental UN principles for the role of a lawyer. I urge the Commission and the Council to intervene for the immediate release of the lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Union remains extremely concerned about the grave and deteriorating situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Over the last two years, conditions have gone from being difficult to being near impossible for those who work to defend human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">For Nasrin Sotoudeh and many others like her who work to defend the just causes of fundamental rights and freedom, working from jail is not an option. The impact of her arrest is clear: those in Iran who are brave enough to stand up for those whom the state itself is supposed to protect risk being intimidated, imprisoned or worse.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has been speaking out; more than ten statements were released in 2010 by High Representative and Vice-President Ashton on both the general situation and on individual cases. At the same time, the European Union undertook discreet demarches with the Iranian authorities seeking clarifications and explanations, and conveying clear messages on the need to improve the situation in Iran. A statement on Nasrin Sotoudeh’s case was made by High Representative and Vice-President Ashton on 14 January 2011, which mentioned both Ms Sotoudeh and Ms Shiva Nazar Ahari, a lawyer and a journalist, sentenced respectively to eleven and four years in prison.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Islamic Republic of Iran was recently elected to the membership of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. Mrs Sotoudeh and Ms Ahari are two women who have been deprived of the very rights they were fighting to protect. The European Union will continue reminding the Iranian authorities that, first and foremost, they must comply with those international obligations stemming from the multilateral agreements and conventions they have signed and ratified. We will continue seeking ways to make our action in defence of human rights more effective, using all the means at our disposal. The Iranian people deserve no less.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have a completely superfluous working group here in Parliament whose job it is to look at ways of making the plenary sessions more interesting. This group would have done well to study today’s plenary. All we need is sufficient time, which is why we should also be allowed time on Thursday afternoons. We also need the right President in the chair, who can exercise a judicious measure of rigour and flexibility. This will produce a lively and interesting plenary.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The situation of active human rights defenders in Iran is becoming ever more difficult. In addition, we read about the increasing number of death sentences. The Dutch national, Zahra Bahrami, who had been mentioned in our hurried resolutions previously, was sentenced to death, and her lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, received an 11 year prison sentence ‘for acting against national security’.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As we know, the hallmark of Iran’s legal system is a serious lack of justice and transparency. It is therefore important that the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy does not let the country off the hook, but continues to raise human rights issues in relations with Iran. Let me list the minimum requirements: the immediate and unconditional release of human rights lawyer Sotoudeh and other prisoners of conscience, Bahrami’s death sentence to be reconsidered and the Dutch authorities to be included in handling the case, allowing representatives of the Red Cross to meet with prisoners, and letting human rights organisations into the country to assess the situation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament must react to cases of human rights violations. We have to remember that thanks to the publicising of specific cases, the international community can exert greater pressure on countries which do not respect generally accepted democratic standards. Nasrin Sotoudeh represented Iranian civil and human rights activists at their trials and defended minors who had been sentenced to capital punishment. The Iranian authorities considered her activities to be ‘spreading hostile propaganda’ and sentenced her to 11 years in prison. It is a good thing that her case has appeared on the agenda of a plenary sitting of the European Parliament. The European Parliament, when it calls for the release of Nasrin Sotoudeh and other prisoners of conscience, and also for the establishment of an independent commission to examine the prosecution of human rights defenders, should not be ignored.</p>
