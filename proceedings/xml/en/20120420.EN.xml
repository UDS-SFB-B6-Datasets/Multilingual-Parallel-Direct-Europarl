      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Nicole Kiil-Nielsen, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the motion for a resolution on women and climate change (2011/2197(INI)) (A7-0049/2012).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-011-000" speaker_id="96737" name="Nicole Kiil-Nielsen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues and to express my gratitude for the very interesting contributions I have received for this report which, I hope, will be the start of a growing awareness on the part of our institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In an ideal Parliament, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality would not exist and issues relating to gender and discrimination against women would be spontaneously integrated into all the matters we deal with here, because this is a cross-cutting issue. However, it is necessary to continue to drive the point home without any let-up because we Members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have a responsibility to remove women from the blind spot of European policies. This is particularly true of environmental issues. I would even go so far as to say that we will show in our report that women are not the green plants of ecology. The figures are staggering.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Women are 14 times more likely to die during cyclones, floods and earthquakes. In the tsunami that affected Asia in 2004, for example, and also in the heat wave that hit Europe in 2003, 70% of the victims were women. Why? Women do not have the same resources – economic, social or political – to adapt or even to flee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, in Honduras, thanks to a warning and disaster management system which included women from the outset, La Masica was the only town not to record a single death during and after hurricane Mitch.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Climate change remains an absolute priority but, in a context of economic crisis, ecology is not the only thing to regress. Women’s rights, too, are eroded and it is by linking the two that we are proposing a coherent political vision and effective solutions. In the past, whenever there was a crisis, whenever there was revolution, we were told that women’s rights would come afterwards. This line of reasoning is out of date and unsound. The challenges of climate change and that of justice and equality for women are intrinsically linked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Women are not only victims to be protected. Women also have knowledge and proposals to make: not because they are, of course, different, but because we live in a society where roles are often gendered. Being a woman or a man has an impact on our daily lives, from the management of resources and access to education to the choice of occupation. These differences in experience are reflected in the solutions and ideas proposed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the report, we have identified four types of measures. Firstly, measures of representation. We are calling for women’s representation of at least 40% in political, financial and technical bodies. The voice of women and their organisations must be heard and supported. Secondly, measures concerning protection and training, establishing a virtuous cycle for women, from victims to agents of change. Thirdly, measures of education, not only to open up the future green economy and encourage women to pursue scientific and technical careers, but also to support the necessary changes in lifestyle patterns. Finally, as regards research, we need data disaggregated by sex to be collected to improve our understanding of the subject and our policy proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To summarise the spirit of this report, we maintain that policies to combat climate change can be enriched through the integration of gender issues and that combating discrimination generates solutions that are more effective for the environment. It is a win-win line of reasoning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we approach the Rio+20 Summit, it is clear that there are no simple solutions to a challenge as complex and pressing as climate change. It is by broadening our way of thinking that we will find the resources to make a significant change for the better.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and, in particular, of my colleague, Connie Hedegaard, who unfortunately cannot be here today, I very much welcome the report on women and climate change. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and also for her very convincing opening statement.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a good opportunity to discuss how the EU can help women put their stamp on future climate policy. Climate change is already a fact of life for many on our planet, especially in the developing world. As you know, climate change effects hit the most vulnerable the hardest. In the poorest and least-developed countries, women, children and the elderly are the first to suffer. As the report rightly says, even though climate change is gender-neutral, its effects are gender-differentiated. When addressing climate change, the EU looks at how consumption and lifestyle patterns have an impact on our environment. By supporting sustainable, green, low-emission development, we are helping to mitigate the effects of climate change and to stimulate economic development, which will make the poor and vulnerable – predominantly women and children – the principal beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU supports mitigation actions through the geographic and thematic programmes of this development cooperation. As an example, I would like to mention the Sustainable Energy for All summit this week in Brussels, where two panels were dedicated to access to sustainable energy for women. Better access to modern sustainable energy – to cooking stoves, for example – will reduce the use of traditional biomass, which will, in turn, reduce deforestation. It will also increase the available time women have, which would otherwise be spent on collecting wood and cooking on inefficient fires.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to ensure that we have more of such win-win programmes. The EU also aims to mainstream climate change adaptation into EU policies including those on migration and disaster risk reduction. It is all about being forward-looking in order to minimise the inevitable adverse impacts of climate change and gender inequality. Gender is already among the 11 forms of social impact which should be screened as part of any impact assessment carried out today by the Commission before it makes any kind of proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">As underlined in the report, gender-neutral policies start with gender-balanced representation in policy definition. Decision makers need to listen to women and make use of their knowledge in adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, while women constitute the majority of the world’s poor, women’s voices are often insufficiently heard. Women are under-represented in national decision making and in international climate negotiations. In the recent communication on a renewed EU-Pacific development partnership, it is stated clearly that gender inequalities may hamper countries’ capacity to address climate change impacts.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is particularly relevant in a region like the Pacific, where women are under-represented in public decision making and levels of gender-based violence remain high. Pacific leaders acknowledge the need to take women’s experience, knowledge and priorities into account more effectively if they are to address the impact of climate change successfully and be able to achieve sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the goal of raising women’s representation to the 40% level advocated in this report, women have chaired the last three conferences of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Durban conference of the parties adopted decisions explicitly referring to the need to ensure gender balance in the adaptation committee and the standing committee on climate finance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU needs to ensure gender balance among the members of these bodies as far as possible. The Danish Presidency decision to present the set of indicators on women and climate change to the Council illustrates the fact that this critical area is high on the agenda. This is an important step towards developing a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating the gender dimension of decision making and policies at all levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will need funding and capacity-building to enhance women’s knowledge of climate change and how to adapt their daily lives. It is our responsibility to give the concerns of women and the most vulnerable a place in national and international climate policy. The report before us is a very useful contribution in advocating climate equity: I commend it and I applaud the rapporteur and the European Parliament for this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to conclude on this positive note: I truly believe that climate action can contribute to development in the world’s poorest regions and improve the living conditions of many men and women in the developing world. The Commission will continue to mainstream gender issues into policy making, including the fight against climate change and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, a big thank you to our rapporteur. Women make up 70% of the poorest population category in the world. As the rapporteur and the Commissioner have said, climate change hits women especially hard. They lose the most as a result of natural disasters and conflicts over natural resources, for example.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ironically enough, women form the major part of the category of people who are least responsible for climate change and the proportion of women who have a say in new climate change strategies is actually far too low. However, they are the greatest hands-on experts and I therefore think they can make a real contribution to a better climate policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is still far too little knowledge about gender equality and climate change, but what we can say is that greater equality is better for the environment and a better climate contributes to greater gender equality. Think of the many female water-carriers who are having to commit their time to carrying water back and forth, or wood, as the Commissioner said, and who cannot spend that time on study, for example, or finishing their education.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That needs to change and I would say: a clever girl is ready to deal with climate change!</p>

    <intervention id="5-014-000" speaker_id="96848" name="Mariya Nedelcheva" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to commend the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Ms Kiil-Nielsen, and the shadow rapporteurs on this report, which deals with the role women can play in combating climate change, and which shows the intrinsic link between gender equality and environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, more than ever, we need to realise that things do not move forward if we exclude women – that is to say, more than 50% of the world’s population – from political, economic, commercial and environmental decisions. Women are active contributors to development and environmental protection, not only because they are often those most affected by the consequences of the policies in this area, but also because they are often those with the best knowledge of good practices. It is thus particularly important to recognise women’s capacity as effective agents of change in the context of environmental protection and management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also believe that environmental protection is achieved through giving women access to the relevant fields of education. The European Union has a responsibility to inform women and to open the doors of scientific research to them to enable them to acquire higher-level knowledge and skills.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, we need to promote the place of women in decision-making positions so as to ensure a wider variety of green solutions. This would contribute to better management of environmental problems while fostering gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, we must emphasise the importance of gender equality and of empowering women in the context of sustainable development. The full participation of women in environmental protection and management can contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and address the challenges of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a virtuous circle, where women become agents in environmental protection, and sustainable development gives women better access to material, economic and natural resources. It is a win-win relationship. The Commission and the Member States will strengthen the added-value of the tools of internal and external action and of development policies and strategies, if the links between the promotion of women’s rights, gender equality, economic growth, sustainable development and environmental protection are finally strengthened.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur. Ms Kiil-Nielsen has presented an interesting and well-structured report. Good cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs has allowed a broad consensus to be reached.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The effects of climate change are not neutral in terms of gender. Climate change does not affect men and women, rich and poor, developed countries and developing countries to the same extent. The effects of climate change are greater in poorer regions and can exacerbate social inequality. Women are the victims of much discrimination. They are particularly affected by poverty. Women make up 70% of poor people, and they are also more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and natural disasters. The eradication of inequality and the fight against climate change are related. There cannot be justice in terms of the climate unless there is real gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Natural disasters have a major medium- and long-term impact in terms of education, health, structural poverty and the displacement of peoples. Children and the elderly are groups that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters. In areas where more disasters occur, the level of school attendance is lower, droughts and water shortages due to climate change force women to work more in order to ensure that there is water, food and energy, and young people frequently leave school in order to help their mothers with these tasks. Measures are therefore needed to integrate the gender dimension into strategies for preventing and managing the risks of natural disasters. Moreover, women are used to managing natural resources, which gives them a potential that should not be neglected in encouraging strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I, too, would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her work on this report. It is an important report, and my speech will also demonstrate the consensus on these issues, both within Parliament and between the various European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In general, women have poorer access to resources and less political power and education, and their circumstances are poorer as a result. Moreover, women and children are affected to a greater degree by the negative effects of climate change. Three quarters of the world’s refugees are women and children. In order to improve the current situation, we require a combination of both small and large measures in which every effort is needed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Without a holistic approach, we will overlook good ideas and important pieces of the puzzle. It has been shown that women have more sustainable consumption and are more inclined to act in a climate-friendly way than us men. Women may be a driving force and the key to the development of new and climate smart everyday innovations for increasing the efficiency of energy and water management. Together, we will make a difference through the responsible and sustainable use of resources in every household and every workplace.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The EU and Europe must lead the way when it comes to utilising the ideas, creativity and capacity for innovation of both women and men in order to deal with our climate challenges in the best way possible. The very combination of women and men is a powerful agent for change and broad participation and is one of the prerequisites for guaranteeing more justice and more comprehensive strategies. As several of my fellow Members have also said, it is therefore important, for example, to have more women represented in those political assemblies that are able to influence these circumstances, including in the climate negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a deal was reached at the climate change conference thanks to two women. It was direct talks between the EU Climate Action Commissioner and India’s Environment Minister that paved the way for an agreement. The conference was chaired by an equally strong woman, South Africa’s Minister for International Relations and Cooperation, yet this report chooses to ignore the achievements of these women. It would reduce their success to a number, as it calls for 40% quotas for women on climate negotiation teams.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have many times explained to this House that quotas patronise women. Nevertheless, the craze for quotas persists. We have seen demands for quotas in business and in politics, and now climate diplomacy is the target for quota enthusiasts. Quotas distort equality. They also degrade women who have made it to the top because they are the best people for the job. Climate change is a global challenge and we need global agreements to tackle it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report represents an heroic attempt to link two of this Parliament’s main obsessions – women’s rights and climate change – but sadly, it fails to achieve that objective. Climate change gets blamed for many things, mostly without justification, but few people will believe that domestic violence against women is caused by climate change or that the low representation of women in government is caused by global warming.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some will feel it is discriminatory that we do not have a report on men and climate change: after all, men and women live in the same climate, women and men switch on the same lights, televisions and computers, and both men and women inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the report does make one valid point: that women are less able to respond and adapt in the face of changes such as global warming and its side effects. Mr President, the biggest side effect of global warming is the huge economic damage that our climate mitigation policies are doing. High energy prices and excessive regulation are driving jobs, industries and investment out of the EU altogether to other jurisdictions, typically with lower environmental standards. Sadly, it is probably the case that this will impact more seriously on women and on the poor than on the rest of us. The best thing we can do for women, for the poor of this world, and for all mankind, is to scrap our absurd and damaging climate policies.</p>

    <intervention id="5-019-000" speaker_id="109649" name="Mikael Gustafsson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Ms Kiil-Nielsen for her exceptional work and for her cooperation on the report. This report is, in fact, an historic one in that, as far as I know, this is the first time that Parliament has examined climate issues from a gender perspective. The report makes it very clear that climate change is not gender neutral.</p>
      <p sl="sv">For example, men make a greater contribution to climate change than women, but it is women who are hardest hit. Men’s lifestyles quite simply leave a larger environmental footprint. Thus, women’s consumption is more sustainable, but women also seem to be more willing than men to take action to protect the environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is important that the report highlights the concept of climate justice, as the current injustices will become even greater if we do not get to grips with climate change. It will affect poor countries in general and women in particular. The Millennium Development Goals are therefore at risk as a result of mankind’s destruction of the environment. It is also clear that the quota of men that currently permeates the whole of society is also present in connection with climate change.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I therefore support the report’s proposal concerning targeted measures such as the introduction of quotas in order to increase the representation of women at all levels in the decision-making processes. The EU and its Member States must set a good example and improve considerably in this area.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Women are important key players when it comes to combating climate change. Several good examples demonstrate that women’s education saves lives through disaster management, boosts biodiversity, prevents desertification and protects forests. In the same vein as the representative from the Commission, I would like to say that when women participate in climate work, their position in society is frequently enhanced, too. This, in turn, leads to increased democracy and promotion of human rights.</p>

    <intervention id="5-020-000" speaker_id="96770" name="Joanna Katarzyna Skrzydlewska" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, discussion of women and climate change is a relatively new phenomenon, although, in view of the fact that it is women who are mainly responsible for making decisions in connection with consumption and household activities, and also of the fact that it is women who are generally the more active representatives of civil society, I think much greater attention should be given to this subject. Today, I would like to underscore how women could be still more involved in work and action to combat climate change.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, we should strive to increase the number of women who study technical subjects, for example. This will not only allow them to gain valuable knowledge and become experts, but it will mean they will be employed in sectors which are directly involved with climate change and will increase the share they have in making key decisions in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, I strongly support the idea of creating targeted policies aimed at ensuring the development of entrepreneurship in a general sense in the context of equal access of women and men to jobs and the green economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, I would like to point out that alongside long-term strategies, changes also need to be made as quickly as possible to give women easier access to loans and, in particular, to micro-credits. Through their determination and innovative approach, women who have access to micro-credits, insurance systems and services will play an extremely important role in developing the green economy and mitigating the effects of climate change.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the big challenge faced by mankind today, that of climate change, is closely related to equality. The risk of dying in cases of natural disasters or from their impact is 14 times higher for women than men. Statistics provide an initial explanation for this, showing that 70% of the world’s poorest are women, because they work pre-eminently in agriculture, 85% of the people who die as a result of climate-induced natural disasters are women, and 75% of environmental refugees are women. Women are also more likely to be the unseen victims of resource wars and violence resulting from climate change.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, women are discriminated against in terms of access to resources and technologies and services of any kind, including medicine and drugs. For the most part, women do not own land, cannot get loans and, basically, have no decision-making power. These are some of the reasons for which women are less able to adapt to climate change.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that, by addressing this topic, we are not launching a competition between gender equality and climate change policies, but rather we need to find the best suited solutions in order to advance simultaneously in these areas. I congratulate the rapporteur and support the proposal to create gender-disaggregated databases during project assessment and implementation phases. A better understanding of the gender dimension of climate change is essential in order to find the best solutions for policies aimed at combating this problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Ms Kiil-Nielsen for the great work she has accomplished. I very much welcome this report calling for a greater role for women in tackling climate change. I believe the integration of gender issues in climate change policies would make such policies more effective, efficient and fair.</p>
      <p sl="en">Statistics show that women are disproportionately affected by climate change, notably as victims of climate- and resource-related wars, natural disasters and in terms of infectious diseases, malnutrition and gender-based violence. We have to take into account this issue within Europe’s climate diplomacy and ensure that climate change and disaster-reduction measures are gender responsive. Gender mainstreaming would allow the mitigation of gender-related discrimination and use women’s potential to understand better the gender aspect of climate change in order to develop informed and responsive adaptation strategies. The collection of gender-disaggregated data should be promoted.</p>
      <p sl="en">While recognising that gender is an important factor in combating climate change, the EU’s first priority should be achieving a legally binding international climate change commitment. For this reason, it is crucial for the EU primarily to address the climate change issue at global level and convince international partners to set aside differences in order to reach a sustainable, credible and long-lasting agreement. There is an urgent need for policy makers to reach such an agreement which will be gender sensitive and should include mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it would be easy to mock this report. Indeed, it is being laughed at by millions of British voters reading their papers this morning. Coming at a time when the euro disaster is breaking nations and driving desperate people to suicide, this staggering exercise in politically correct sloganising could – had it been on the agenda at the start of this month – easily have been mistaken for an April Fool’s joke. But in truth, this attempt to institutionalise discrimination and contempt against half the population of Europe is not a laughing matter. Men and women are conceived to complement each other for the common good. This proposal is an attempt to sow discord between the sexes, break family values and export EU Frankfurt School poison worldwide, using the excuse of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such incitement to gender-based contempt, division and hate is not a victimless crime. Hundreds of thousands of men are denied access to their children after bitter divorces. Thousands of children are snatched by the state because the crucial importance of fathers and loving, united families is denied and undermined by militant feminism of the sort that underlies this report. Meanwhile, there are real problems out there hurting real people. Voters expect us at least to try to solve them, not to waste our time and their money on sexist anti-male, anti-family gibberish.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, climate change must, of course, be addressed as a whole, not only at the level of the European Union, but also globally. The fact remains that women, especially those who live in developing countries, are the main victims. The constant discrimination suffered by women in terms of income, access to resources, and participation in political decision making are some of the factors that explain the extreme vulnerability of women when natural disasters occur in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our policy to combat climate change must not ignore gender issues, just as our development aid policy must not fail to give greater consideration to the role of women in developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, this report shows how women and men are responsible to different degrees for the changes to the climate that are happening, that we have different levels of access to our common resources, and that we are affected differently by climate change. This knowledge is essential if we are to be able to change our behaviour and attitudes and change the world. This is what most of us in the European Parliament want, even if perhaps not all of us are thinking along the same lines. These values and this knowledge need to be present both within the EU and in other parts of the world. We enter into trade and environment agreements and the gender equality aspect needs to be included in these.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to thank Ms Kiil-Nielsen for this report on climate policy. It takes a slightly different approach from the usual one.

      <p sl="sv">If the climate policy that we decide on here, usually with broad majority support, is to become reality and not merely empty words on paper, we need reports that will guide us in the way that this report is able to. Thank you once again for this work.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is acknowledged at international level that it is certainly the poor who suffer the most. Well, 70% of the world’s poorest are women. In the developing world, it is women who play a crucial role in the abstraction and practical management of water, not just in the home but also in farming, and it is women who today have to work more owing to droughts and water shortages resulting precisely from climate change.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, our climate is changing. Women are affected by this and they can also do something to prevent it. This discussion will only become ridiculous if people make speeches like the one just made by Mr Griffin. This is an important report. We know that scientists and experts are searching for causes and solutions and, of course, their opinions often differ. Despite all the different interpretations, we can be sure of one thing. If we continue using raw materials all over the world as we are currently doing, then this planet’s resources will soon be exhausted. Energy saving is essential, whichever way you look at it. Climate change affects not only our environment. Shortages of food and water are causing increased economic concerns and the result of this will be social problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is calling in its report on women and climate change for the greater involvement of women in this area. Women make up half of the population. Around 70% of the poorest people in the world and 80% of refugees and exiles are women. It is important for women to become more involved in combating climate change and this can be achieved by means of education and training. Women play an important role in managing resources in the home. They are involved at a very basic level and they decide how the house is heated or cooled and what energy sources are used. Given that half of the energy used in houses is wasted through inefficiency, there is huge potential here for reducing CO2 emissions. Women also lay the foundations for the sensible consumption of resources within the family and when educating their children. We must make use of their experience in leading roles. If we want to make the world a better place, we can only do this with the help of women.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report highlights important connections and courses of action. However, it should concentrate on the important subject of women and climate change and not dilute its own message by including other fundamental topics, such as quotas and reproduction issues.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work. There is still a lack of understanding of the link between the gender aspect and climate change, which is probably why Mr Griffin does not really understand this problem and said this today. A lot of work still needs to be done in this area because the gender aspect has not yet been integrated into climate policies. The whole of humanity is affected by climate change, but repeated natural disasters have demonstrated that women and children are worst affected by these and have the highest rate of mortality. Impoverished women in developing countries are those worst hit by climate change: they do hard physical work running the household and working in agriculture, which is a real drain on their health. Unfortunately, women often have no access to health services and now, as well as in the future, women will therefore need even more physical and spiritual strength to deal with climate change. Currently, there is still a lack of data and statistics produced according to gender. This, unfortunately, also hinders a better understanding and evaluation of the gender aspect in the area of climate change. The impact of climate change will only increase in future and combating climate change must therefore be a priority for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, awareness of the links between gender policies and climate change has only recently developed, and gender issues have yet to be fully integrated into climate change policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">Presently, the international situation is by no means propitious, and there is a high risk that no international climate change agreement will be reached. The spotlight is now on the meeting that will be held in Rio de Janeiro in June. I think that the inclusion of gender issues provides an opportunity to make the fight against climate change stronger, fairer and more effective. This mainstreaming must be based on two principles: addressing the effects of inequality and tackling its causes.</p>
      <p sl="it">An improved understanding of the links between climate change and women by means of a system for the collection of gender-disaggregated data would help identify the areas where we need to take action, in order to save energy and water resources which women use in a different way to men to satisfy the needs of their families. Awareness of the unequal situation of men and women involves two aspects: assistance and empowerment, which must be jointly included in EU policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope that the link between gender and climate can be effectively included in EU programmes and not just in individual policies. Climate change concerns all areas of human activity and must therefore be incorporated horizontally across the EU’s projects and financial activities.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, climate change is causing environmental and humanitarian crises. It has a drastic impact on poor countries and people. I refer here, in particular, to women, because they account for 85% of the victims of natural disasters caused by climate conditions and 75% of environmental refugees.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report contains numerous positive suggestions, which I endorse, such as the proposal to ensure social justice and a ‘climate-friendly’ indicator. However, the need to incorporate the gender dimension in all climate and sustainable development policies needs to be emphasised. In order to do so, we need specialised research and expert opinions on gender issues, so that we can plan rational natural disaster risk prevention and management strategies, manage environmental immigration correctly and obtain adequate financing from funds and climate-related resources. In my opinion, the European Union should incorporate the gender dimension into targeted climate-related policies, so that solutions can be found.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for her work, but I am embarrassed when I read paragraph 30 of the present report.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I quote: ‘The European Parliament recognises that population growth has an impact on the climate and highlights the need to respond adequately where the contraceptive needs of women and men in any society remain unmet’. I have two questions. Does the rapporteur wish to say that we should stop having children in the name of saving the climate? Should we hand out condoms and pills and provide reproductive health services because of climate change and exhaled CO2 ? If ideology leads us here, to a point that is beyond absurdity, rational debate loses its meaning because we are at a loss for words. This report on the negative impacts of climate change on women suggests that the solution is to rid women of femininity by deterring them from motherhood. None of the Millennium Development Goals mentions a reduction in the population growth in developing countries. It would be an obvious contradiction. Human life, even though it may be thousands of kilometres distant from us, still has such value that the United Nations convenes due to lack of drinking water and in order to rescue people from death. Experts come together and billions are outlaid in order to keep them alive, but this paradox exists. It is based on the assumption that one of the main sources of poverty – and, according to this report, also climate change – is population growth.</p>
      <p sl="sk">These claims, however, are seriously flawed. In January 2011, the International Monetary Fund published a table that predicted the ten fastest growing economies in the world, and amongst them were seven African countries with the highest birth rates. It is a pity that in a single point, this report could throw into doubt the meaning behind all the positive proposals it contains.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Ms Kiil-Nielsen’s report, I think that the European Parliament is once again showing just how determined it is to support the creation of a fairer, more participative and more democratic society; I would not call it an obsession, as Mr Helmer did, but a just and commendable determination to create a European Union better equipped to meet the challenges of the third millennium.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ms Kiil-Nielsen’s report focuses on mainstreaming gender into climate change policy, but I confess that, despite the rapporteur’s laudable efforts, I have not fully grasped these direct links. However, I, of course, fully support the objectives of this report, the wider objectives of this report, which are to try to create a society where differences are no longer accepted.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can no longer accept a society where women own less than 1% of the world’s resources, comprise 70% of those living on less than one dollar a day, make up just 17% of the world’s parliamentarians and earn 10% of the world’s income for working two thirds of the hours worked worldwide. All of these issues must be overcome.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that Ms Kiil-Nielsen’s report is an effective exposé of this state of affairs and is an important instrument which, perhaps, we can use to implement that comprehensive toolkit referred to by Commissioner Potočnik, in order to mainstream gender into all policies. While it is true that climate change certainly has a greater impact on the more vulnerable, marginalised categories, which women fall into in certain cases, it is also true that we should look again, in a cross-cutting way, at the issue of women in all EU policies and all national policies.</p>

However, I also agree with Ms Klass, who said we should not get lost in the details, but must identify the important priorities, the important issues.</p>
      <p sl="sl">For me, education is particularly important. There is a saying – when you educate a man, you educate an individual, when you educate a woman, you educate a whole family. Education is therefore very significant. Then comes awareness, because women can influence patterns of behaviour. The third thing I think is very important is that women are more commonly, much more commonly, the victims of natural disasters and we should give this greater consideration when we discuss EU development aid.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Finally, allow me to mention one more very significant problem, which is the representation of women in decision-making bodies. Personally, I also support all efforts and proposals that would increase women's participation in decision-making bodies in general.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for an excellent report, but, if you would allow me to, I want to say a few critical words about attitudes to climate change more generally. When the subject of the discussion is climate change, we all too often speak about numbers and markets. In my opinion, it is people who should be made the focal point of climate change: those who encounter it in their everyday lives. For example, for a woman in a developing country who is in the most difficult of circumstances, climate change is not just about the failure of markets, but how it is affecting everyday life. This is generally ignored. Climate change is about people, and numbers and markets are only a secondary consideration.</p>

Moreover, it is precisely that vulnerability that reflects a structural problem, structural patriarchy, a problem on which this Parliament has heard some very clear and very worrying exponents.</p>
      <p sl="es">The proposals made by the Kiil-Nielsen report simply represent common sense in today’s world, they constitute basic needs, and they present a fundamental challenge, as follows: 1) increasing the training and empowerment of women in decision making, in all areas; 2) turning victims into actors. This is what the report is asking for, that we move to a position where we invest more in training, in protection and in preparation; 3) incorporating gender issues in policies to combat climate change in a very clear way. Common sense, pure and simple.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Ms Kiil-Nielsen, on this excellent report. As the rapporteur has said, women are much more affected by climate change. The climate is also changing due to non-compliance with environmental instruments. The climate is also changing due to the lack of political support. The climate is also changing due to the lack of responsibility all over the world and in Europe. I will give you a very specific everyday example from my country: the case of women in the fisheries sector. These are women who catch seafood. Climate change is worsening because the governments are not cleaning the coasts. These women do not receive pensions. They cannot work because the coast is not clean. I therefore support this report, as it advocates that these environmental commitments, which so greatly affect women, are met.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that when it comes to women and climate, we are talking about a real and serious programme. That is why I very much appreciate the attention focused on it by the rapporteur and by all of you who contributed. I am sure that my colleague, Connie Hedegaard, also appreciates that very much.</p>
      <p sl="en">A lot of convincing points have been aired in this debate. The things which have really stayed in my mind are key words such as awareness, data, knowledge, education, mainstreaming and science. On community support for women and women’s education, I could add that by 2015, all development-financing proposals will include gender-specific indicators, and climate-related projects under Horizon 2020 – our new framework programme – will include gender-specific analysis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you might know that in my previous term of office, I was responsible for science and research, and the question of women in science was one of the very serious questions that we tried to address. Unfortunately, there is no quick fix. Nowadays, certain developments are very encouraging: there are some facts on the number of female doctorate students, which is increasing more rapidly than the corresponding figure for men, and on the number of women researchers, which is growing at a rate nearly twice that of their male counterparts. So the situation is getting better, although it should continue in future to be a focus of attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is largely connected to the move from studying into the world of work. The reality is that women scientists earn less than their male counterparts; more of them are employed on short-term contracts; they climb the ladder of success more slowly, and so on. These are all real issues which we should address at the very core of the problem, and a holistic approach – involving social policy – should be used to the utmost extent. I myself have experienced the power of women in international negotiations, and I can say from my own experience that this is a fact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to say something on what we discussed yesterday. Yesterday, I was in Denmark, in Horsens, where we had an informal Council devoted to two themes. One of them was the 7th Environment Action Programme, which we will discuss later on and which concerns the next episode of our environmental policy for the mid to long term. We also discussed the Rio+20 Earth Summit, which involves similar themes but obviously in a more international environment. I can report that gender balance and the role of women were issues underlined in our discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that we see these issues not only in the context of climate change, but also in the context of green growth or, more broadly speaking, in the context of sustainable development. As some of you rightly pointed out, inclusion and equity are absolute requirements for sustainable development. Just as development cannot be solely about economic growth, sustainability cannot be solely about protecting the environment. Development must be people-centred, promoting rights, opportunities, choices and dignity, and green growth must also be inclusive growth, generating social progress and contributing to eradicating poverty and achieving greater equality, as well as sustaining our natural environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, the title of the conference in Rio which we will be attending in June is exactly that: ‘Green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication’. All the issues which are highlighted in this report are also very relevant to those themes.</p>

I also know that we can count on the Danish Presidency having, in fact, heard a number of proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank all my colleagues, men and women, who have spoken here today, because what they have said has simply reflected the work we have done collectively, which is very enriching for us all. I think this debate was necessary, and that we must, of course, continue to raise awareness. Each one of us here has contributed to this report and I am very satisfied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I know that we can also rely on the Institute for Gender Equality, which we created in Vilnius in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should nonetheless like to say something. I would like to pay tribute to all the women and women’s associations worldwide who have long understood that something had to be done about preserving resources and about climate issues. In some countries, women have known this for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, I will mention India, where, within the Chipko movement, women attached themselves to trees to save them; Rwanda too, where women have preserved 600 kinds of beans. I would also like to pay homage to Wangari Maathai, whom no one here will have forgotten, who left us recently and who, with her Green Belt movement, preserved millions of trees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Women in developing countries recognised the need to take action a long time ago and we know we can count on them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A final point, which has been raised several times, is the issue of quotas. My political group and I, personally, are very much in favour of this tool. It is only a tool, per se , but it has enabled us to become the only political group with equal representation in this Parliament. I believe it is the only way, unfortunately, to move things forward. If we do not use this tool of allocating quotas, we will not succeed in advancing gender equality. It is simply a tool.</p>

In seeking Climate Justice, it is important to highlight the links between access to clean, affordable, sustainable energy and gender. In the developing world, in particular, energy is vital for women’s development in terms of reducing their time burden for collecting firewood used in cooking and heating and improving their health and well-being. Access to, and control over, clean energy sources is central to unleashing the potential of rural women. The provision of clean cook stoves can mitigate the negative environmental and health impacts while promoting women’s empowerment, as the time that would have been used to collect fuel can be used for other productive and economic activities. I would urge the Commission to take concrete measures to ensure: (1) that more women take up careers in science and technology; (2) that women are properly represented at high-level climate change talks and decision-making bodies by requiring at least 40% female representation; and (3) that data collection and analysis reflect the gender specific issues in dealing with climate change.</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported the report on the impact of climate change on women because it raises a very specific aspect of environmental policies. Climate change is not only about nature and natural resources. Human rights and human well-being are challenged by climate change as well. And our efforts in this domain could improve life conditions for millions of people on the Earth. The report clearly shows how the environmental policies can promote equality between women and men if they are adjusted to meet the specific needs of women. The issue is particularly important, since women play a much more significant role in climate change-related activities than men. We have to provide women equal opportunities, promote their rights to work, to an equal salary, to necessary health conditions. We also have to improve communication in order to learn their demands and to encourage them to use existing opportunities. Therefore, I support the rapporteur’s call to the European institutions and national governments to make more efforts to make their environmental policies more gender sensitive.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of an economic and financial crisis and there is no getting around it. Newspapers are full of it every day, television news leads with reports about it and the European Council seems to be meeting about almost nothing else.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, alongside this omnipresent crisis, we have another crisis, an entirely silent one. A silent crisis of disappearing species, of disappearing habitats and of oceans with ever decreasing water levels. This is the crisis we are talking about this morning.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We know the figures: 25% of all species in Europe are under serious threat, only a sixth of all habitats in Europe are in a favourable condition and as much as 75% of all fish stocks have been overfished. According to statistical experts working for TEEB, the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study, every year, we lose 3% of our gross domestic product through loss of biodiversity. Each year, Europe therefore loses EUR 450 billion! That is in quite a different league to the one-off emergency fund for the euro which our government leaders have worked very hard to put together for two years now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You could also say that what we are talking about today is the largest multinational in Europe, because there is nothing that produces so much food, that provides so many services, that supplies us with so many products and offers so many jobs. Today, we are talking about nature, Europe’s biggest service provider! Any other multinational company of that magnitude would be politically canonised and, indeed, it would be too big to fail. However, when it comes to the multinational of nature, all that we have very often is just fine words.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is because, let us face it, we were in this very same position ten years ago, when we decided the previous biodiversity strategy. The loss of species was supposed to have been brought to a standstill in 2010. We have failed miserably in that respect, and why? Because at those moments when it really mattered, fine words proved not to be worth much and other interests prevailed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The main question, then, today, is: what should we do differently to the past ten years so that, in 2020, we do not conclude that we have failed yet again? Let us begin with what we are required to do by law. Is that asking too much of Member States? Why do citizens have to obey the law and Member States not? That is, not like the Netherlands, refusing to restore nature in the Western Scheldt, as we are legally obliged to do, and then getting angry when Commissioner Potočnik finds that unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Obviously, it is very important that we integrate these environmental interests in other policy areas. We have a unique opportunity. The agricultural policy is being reformed, the fisheries policy is being reformed and the cohesion policy is being reformed. Half of the European territory consists of farmland. Without active participation on the part of farmers, there will be no nature. However, I say to you, ladies and gentlemen, the reverse is also true: without a strong natural environment, there can be no agriculture, no pollination without bees and no crop whatsoever without fertile soil.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We also need to develop the ‘no net loss’ principle and really apply it. Can anyone give me a better example of how to halt the loss of biodiversity than by just stopping those activities that destroy nature? We also need to stop talking about the inclusion of natural capital in our national annual accounts and just do it: no words please, just deeds!</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, we have to be courageous enough to think bigger. Many Europeans believe that true nature exists only in Africa or the Amazon. What nonsense! Europe has a beautiful natural world, though it may not yet have its own Serengeti or Yellowstone. We could have them, however. There are areas where agricultural land is poor, areas people are leaving. Let us invest in them differently and build them up into a new wilderness, into attractions for nature lovers. Real safari in Europe, it really is possible! That will also give these desolate areas totally new economic prospects.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, Madam President, I would very much like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive contribution to making this report what it is now. Thanks, obviously, also to Commissioner Potočnik, who has never failed to stand up for the importance of nature, inside or outside Europe. He did that impressively in Nagoya and will also be doing so at Rio+20. The next step is to develop legislation. As a member of Parliament, I would very much like to help him there and, in particular, start the struggle with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, let us take care of nature, the largest and most important service provider of this world. This multinational belongs to all of us. And one exception has already been made – State aid is possible!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish, on behalf of the Commission, to thank Mr Gerbrandy and all the honourable Members who have participated in the development of this very comprehensive, high-quality report. Many of the facts that you mentioned in your opening remarks were more than convincing and told a worrying story.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the midst of a very bleak picture for biodiversity in the European Union, this report, fully supporting the EU 2020 biodiversity targets and actions proposed by the Commission, has reinforced my conviction that the European Parliament is a major driving force in restoring this alarming loss of resources. Parliament’s call for a higher restoration rate of ecosystems than proposed at global level under the Convention on Biological Diversity is particularly significant in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against the background of difficult austerity measures across the continent, this report demonstrates that the EU is maintaining its strong and steady commitment to resisting the pressure of further eroding its natural capital. This year, which will see us celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Habitats Directive and of Natura 2000, is of particular importance. We need to acknowledge the success of our nature conservation policy and identify clearly the challenges ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">But do the circumstances we are currently facing mean that we should protect biodiversity and the Natura 2000 network with fewer resources? The answer is rather that we should be daring and innovative in the toolbox we use to develop our objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report suggests a number of promising ways forward, calling as it does for collaborative biodiversity protection and more efficient mobilisation of our available financial and human resources and for us to rise above outdated economic models and embrace new, greener ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just as collaborative consumption is revolutionising old market behaviour, collaborative biodiversity protection will reinvent the way in which all the actors involved take part in combating biodiversity loss, in ways and on a scale never witnessed before.</p>
      <p sl="en">The biodiversity crisis can be addressed successfully through new approaches that promote the exchange of knowledge, technologies, data, innovative solutions and products, and by mobilising all the actors on the ground. Progress in research and innovation partnerships will facilitate this even more. However, this alone will not suffice.</p>
      <p sl="en">An in-depth review of how financial and human resources have thus far been allocated to biodiversity protection is paramount. This undeniably requires better integration in national and EU policies, in particular, the common agricultural and fisheries policies, the cohesion policy, external instruments and development cooperation. It calls for more efficient mobilisation of public and private funds as well as stressing the need to minimise the pressures on biodiversity. But it also requires developing innovative partnerships with business, as is being achieved through the planned ‘No Net Loss’ initiative, and an increased use of instruments such as procedures for the valuation of, and payments for, ecosystem services.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now at a crucial stage of the implementation of nature legislation: while the designation of Natura 2000 sites is nearing completion (with the main gaps in the designation of marine sites), the main priority shifts to ensuring that the network is effectively managed and properly resourced. The Commission proposed a strengthened integrated approach, for example, by using various EU structural funds together with an enhanced biodiversity strand of the LIFE Programme. To that effect, the prioritised action frameworks to be developed by the Member States will allow a strategic planning approach for the next programming period.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, we look forward to engaging with Parliament in the implementation of the biodiversity strategy, and I thank you for all your efforts.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has, in this opinion, reaffirmed that environmental protection and economic development do not present a conflict of interest, but rather a symbiosis of the two goals of sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Biodiversity is not only valued in terms of environmental protection and a healthy living environment, but also has a socio-economic value. It is particularly necessary to emphasise this in these times of crisis. Rich and diverse nature is an inexhaustible source of new knowledge and inspiration for innovation and, as such, can develop new skills, jobs and business opportunities. Therefore, the horizontal role of biodiversity in European policies should be strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Let me mention some of the policies for which our committee is responsible. In energy and industrial policy, biodiversity forms part of the sustainable use of resources. The development of information technologies can also be an opportunity for biodiversity conservation. We devoted particular attention to the importance of research policy and we support greater investment in this area.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Science can facilitate a better understanding of biodiversity and the interaction of different factors within it. We particularly welcome the launch of the Business and Biodiversity Platform and encourage the Commission to further develop the platform. This will promote greater cooperation between public administrations and businesses in Europe, including SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="sl">At the same time, we call your attention to the uncoordinated preparation of strategic infrastructure documents and we invite the European Commission to present a Green Infrastructure Strategy as soon as possible. We would like to thank rapporteur Gerbrandy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for having taken into account most of our proposals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have heard today about the silent crisis unfolding across Europe. It is happening right under our noses. When the rivers run dry, the forests are too small to clean the air and the ecosystem supporting our agriculture collapses, we will wonder how we did not see it happening.</p>
      <p sl="en">Right now, too many people are choosing not to listen and not to see. Nature is dying all around us, and as we bury our heads in the ever-less-fertile soil, it will continue. There will be 30% fewer species in existence when our grandchildren grow up. As with any other crisis, it is our job as legislators to stop the problems causing this silent massacre.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome this report from Mr Gerbrandy and I urge the Commission to sit up and take note. We call on you to take action to protect our generation and the generations to come. We must not end up having to face our grandchildren and admit that we stood by and did nothing as the wonderful diversity of nature on this planet – ours and theirs – silently died around us.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European natural heritage is a major ecological asset which contributes to the well-being of all citizens, and therefore all EU Member States should cooperate and coordinate their efforts to ensure a more effective use of natural resources and limit biodiversity degradation. When we speak of biodiversity, we must refer to both the extraordinary biodiversity existing in parks and nature reserves, which are already protected or in the process of being included on the list, and the ordinary biodiversity, also known as functional biodiversity. It plays a major role in maintaining the habitat of small fauna and insects, especially those contributing to plant pollination. On the other hand, the preservation of basic natural resources, of animal and plant genetic resources and of the environment, and the coordination of agricultural technological processes are necessary in order to be able to ensure that conditions for future generations are met. I believe that in order to ensure the preservation of biodiversity, it is essential to have a balance between the European biodiversity strategy and Member States’ rural development.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to stress that no country is capable, by itself, of dealing with the problem of biodiversity loss. The Member State governments must cooperate with each other.</p>
      <p sl="it">I call on the Commission to re-examine the maximum sustainable yield, taking account of all aspects of fish populations, in particular, size, age and reproductive status, and addressing the issue of multi-species stocks.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to point out that achieving the six targets of the new EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 depends on compliance with the rules already laid down by the EU and proper management of the relevant initiatives and programmes, in particular, the Natura 2000 network of protected areas and the LIFE+ programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I would like to highlight that the key element of the EU’s commitment lies in the forthcoming reforms of the common agricultural and fisheries policies, and in the multiannual financial framework, and I would point out that the inadequate degree to which biodiversity protection was integrated into EU policies caused the failure of the first strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, I would remind you that when they took the last reservation away from Sitting Bull, he told the President of the United States something that should serve as a warning to us all: ‘Only after the last tree has been felled, only after the last buffalo has been killed, only after the last fish has been caught, only then will you find that money cannot be eaten’. Let us keep these words in mind.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Gerbrandy report on an EU biodiversity strategy to 2020, in the form adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is a very good one. It presents balanced positions which take account of the different approaches to biodiversity in the Member States, and it supports the objectives of the biodiversity strategy and the urgent need for them to be accomplished. It also supports the need to be effective in continued attempts to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Now it is the European Parliament which has to give clear support for such objectives and for work to promote biodiversity, and also to call attention to the fact that there is an urgent need for this work to be done. It is important to give generally greater political importance to the priority of biodiversity and to resist tendencies to reduce the significance of this work in the face of economic difficulties. The common agricultural policy must be linked to biodiversity protection. Without the help of farmers in this process, we will not achieve the expected results.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, it is equally important for all the Member States to be able to meet the targets which have been set. The main requirement for the strategy is that it has to be workable. Another opportunity has now arisen for biodiversity, because the European Union has already missed one, when it failed to meet the 2010 target. If it is to achieve success now, the EU institutions and the Member States have to show greater determination and be more effective in what they do. During the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we showed unanimity, and I hope that during the vote at today’s sitting, we will also maintain that unanimity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A huge amount of systematic educational work is also needed, not only among young people and children, but also among people working in different sectors, such as farmers and industrial workers. It is also essential to include local governments in this process. They need to be given a role to play, and under the Cohesion Fund we need to support projects which aim to protect biodiversity. We must not allow industry and enterprise to develop without proper control at the cost of biodiversity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of his report and the good work that he has carried out, and to reaffirm that it is only with ambition, political will and adequate funding that we can meet the EU biodiversity 2020 objectives. The protection of biodiversity should be made part of all of the EU’s policies, in particular, in the context of the ongoing reforms of the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The next financial framework must make the necessary resources available to fund the strategy. This funding will be offset from an environmental and economic standpoint, as the cost of biodiversity loss may reach 7% of GDP by 2050. It is estimated that the benefits associated with the Natura 2000 network could rise to approximately EUR 200-300 billion per year, as well as creating millions of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission and the Member States should make sufficient resources available to fund the Natura 2000 network, and they should also ensure that EU legislation is implemented, in particular, the Birds and Habitats Directive, as well as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The initiatives to be developed in relation to green infrastructure and genetic resources are no less important, nor is the legislation on invasive alien species for which we are looking forward to receiving proposals from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Concrete, integrated and ambitious action and adequate funding are needed in order to achieve the objectives of the biodiversity strategy, and it is also necessary and vital that we do not forget that biodiversity includes all interactions of the living world – species and ecosystems – in direct contact with human activity; food, clothing, health care and the heating of buildings all depend on biodiversity. Biodiversity is a guarantee of life.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report proposes a new strategy to 2020 to combat biodiversity loss, the pace of which, as has been pointed out, is continuing to accelerate dangerously. It aims to remind us of the extent to which our systems and our future are intimately linked to the conservation of our natural and genetic capital – for our food, our health and the fight against climate change – and it highlights the extent to which our future economic development is linked to our ability to conserve biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us remind ourselves that, each year, we are losing 3% of global GDP due to biodiversity loss, that the costs of inaction are far higher than the necessary investment costs and are not simply financial and that urgent measures are needed before the cost becomes too high and the loan taken out can no longer be repaid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our report calls for two immediate measures: the development of innovative financial mechanisms and the elimination of all environmentally harmful public subsidies. However, this report also insists on the need to enshrine our development strategies in a medium and long-term vision and to place the challenges of preserving biodiversity at the heart of our sectoral policies and, first and foremost, at the heart of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the forestry policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If this dimension of integration and ambitious commitments were to disappear from the text during today’s vote, we would be depriving ourselves of one of the main levers for action, and my group would not be able to vote for this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I call on my conservative colleagues not to reject the unblocking of the framework directive on soil protection. Today, 48% of European soil is heavily degraded. This degradation has a cost estimated by the Commission at just under EUR 40 billion annually. Only ambitious action taken at European level can save us from this infernal spiral of the artificial development and sterilisation of our land.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, it is because we need to learn from our past mistakes and look to the future, and beyond Europe, that we have also introduced a reference to the next Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we all agree that the protection and promotion of biodiversity is of vital importance and I welcome the vast majority of the recommendations in this report. I do, however, regret the fact that the report has become quite so wordy, detailed and, in many places, repetitive. I think there is a lost opportunity here – which was possibly seized in the original rapporteur’s report but lost later on – to produce a punchy, straight-to-the-point and clear document. Having said that, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy, for his conscientious efforts to find consensus, which is not so easy with so many amendments and so many opinions from other committees.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to mention one area specifically today, that of agriculture and CAP. The report supports much of the detail of the Commission’s CAP reforms, and I would stress that I am talking about detail here. This is problematic for me and my group. We find it difficult to endorse these details in the report, as this presupposes a general agreement in this area which does not yet exist. The same point applies to statements in the report such as the call for a soil directive.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, it must be acknowledged with regret that the statement on the absolute failure of European policy on biodiversity protection, made in the present report, is true.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There are certainly multiple reasons for this failure. I think one of the reasons why the EU policy on biodiversity spending has missed its goals is a lack of awareness in society about the importance of preserving ecosystems for future life on Earth. We must therefore be able to convincingly explain not only to our citizens, but also to regional politicians and corporate managers, that biodiversity conservation is not incompatible with sustainable economic growth. Better societal awareness of the need to protect and conserve ecosystems will generate more pressure on public authorities, as well as on businesses, to have zero tolerance in their conduct regarding environmental damage. We must invest more in research in order to obtain better knowledge of the interactions between individual elements of ecosystems and know how to avoid interference in nature that can cause serious damage to the system. Research on biodiversity must be multidisciplinary in nature, in order to take into account not only environmental, climatic or genetic aspects, but also social and economic aspects.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Commissioner, the ongoing destruction of ecosystems reminds us that we must be considerably more active in implementing measures for the protection of biodiversity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in 2001, the Commission defined its aim of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Ten years later, it has recognised that this objective has not been reached, and also that global biodiversity is under serious threat. The biodiversity strategy to 2020 is now being discussed. Once again, targets and objectives are being established and several questions therefore arise.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Have the necessary lessons been learned from previous failures? Can we be sure that we will not be here 10 years from now, talking about another failure? What has been done to change direction? What determines success or failure in this case?</p>
      <p sl="pt">A strategy is made up of short-, medium- and long-term objectives, and also of measures to meet those objectives. This strategy has failings in both areas. Let us look at some examples.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, there are still shortcomings both in terms of funding, as in the next multiannual financial framework, and in terms of the mechanisms for monitoring and correcting the implementation of the strategy. Secondly, the essence of some of the sectoral policies with the most important effects on biodiversity remains unchanged. This is true of the agricultural and trade policies, which promote models of intensive production geared towards export, the deregulation and liberalisation of trade, and the weakening of local production and consumption.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is not enough to give these policies a greener appearance, while leaving their foundations unaltered, and maintaining their so-called market orientation. The Commission is enthusiastic about its ‘business and biodiversity’ approach. However, we fear that we are seeing a ‘business as usual’ strategy when it comes to biodiversity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, a day without laughter is a day not worth living! This report by Mr Gerbrandy is utterly laughable. To start with, the total naivety of thinking that human beings can manipulate the preservation of genetic diversity. Next, it is really laughable to ask accountants to include ecosystems in their accounting systems, to include, so to speak, the birds and the bees in their balance sheets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, things become annoying when Mr Gerbrandy argues that we should start developing still more wetlands, for which read swamps, in Europe. That is asking for the return of scary diseases such as malaria.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Things become downright ridiculous when Mr Gerbrandy says he wants to establish a European environmental police, one that would come, like Big Brother, to check whether or not we are sticking to the costly, useless and harmful environmental rules from Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, I read that the EU should indoctrinate pupils and students with the new biodiversity doctrine, namely, that quality agricultural land should continue to give way to ecosystems and fisheries be downsized even more, even though we do not actually know what the state of fish stocks is.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the biggest joke comes at the end. Mr Gerbrandy wants the Committee on Development to introduce biodiversity protection. Madam President, I am in fits! Unfortunately, Mr Gerbrandy believes in his own ravings. I sincerely hope, however, that this Parliament will show more sense and not go along with his madness. And obviously, Mr Potočnik, we are not going to flood any good farmland in the Netherlands, especially not in Zeeland, because that would be a massive destruction of biodiversity.</p>

This applies to 65% of our habitats and 52% of species, with 88% of fish being fished in excess of permissible levels. We must, without fail, mobilise the instruments that exist where the money exists, which means under the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. Clearly, we must obviously stop subsidising actions that further exacerbate the existing drastic situation.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the common fisheries policy, we need to create a new instrument, a compulsory network of ‘no fishing areas’ that will allow stocks to recover.

      <p sl="nl">Various studies have shown that the biodiversity we destroy costs 3% of our gross domestic product each year. That is the value of biodiversity and that is what we need to talk about. We are already seeing concrete examples: we see in agriculture that the number of hives is decreasing and, yet, bees are crucial to our food! But in fisheries, too, well, fishing is becoming increasingly difficult, and why is that the case? It is because we are overfishing! That is the problem and that is what we need to talk about.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is why we very much support the Commissioner and his biodiversity agenda for 2020, but we will obviously have a big problem if we just talk about targets in 2020. We need to talk about policy now ! We are also talking in this House about our agricultural policy and our fisheries policy. Let us be specific: I am, therefore, taking note of all the people who now, today, say how important biodiversity is for the real reform of our agricultural policy and for our fisheries policy, so that biodiversity does not just remain an empty word, but that we really take action on it.</p>

With regard to this conference, the position we are in is almost diametrically opposed to the one we find ourselves in with the report we are debating today, because as yet we do not know how the EU will be involved in this important conference, or who, if anyone, will potentially take part.</p>
      <p sl="da">In Mr Gerbrandy’s report, however, we are extremely precise, both when we talk about new initiatives, such as a comprehensive framework directive on soil for the whole of the Union, and with regard to the financing of biodiversity. However, why should the EU decide the areas in which the Member States are to make things greener, as stated in the report? It states, for example, that this should happen along highways and railroads and at industrial sites. In my opinion, it is completely unnecessary to dictate specific areas in a report, as this is something that falls within the competence of the Member States and should be tailored to local and regional circumstances. I am therefore unable to vote in favour of the report.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, the report also contains a large number of good proposals, including the demand for best practices in respect of available scientific data in order to prevent the loss of biodiversity.

I believe that this is the wrong approach. If we have ecosystem services that can really function effectively, our production processes will improve, we will have better food and we can avoid making many of the investments which are harmful to biodiversity. During the process of developing a new common agricultural policy, we are being presented with the major challenge of turning the protection of biodiversity in Europe into something real and tangible and implementing it in the Member States. Therefore, I believe that we need to take both routes. We need appropriate funding in the long-term European financial framework, but we also need money at the level of the Member States.</p>

This matter should be given high priority, action by the European Union should be intensified, and the problem of biodiversity should be included in the strategies for particular areas of EU activity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Protection of the environment is an important part of our policy. Dealing with these questions and building a common strategy for action is crucial from the point of view of Europe’s development. This is why the biodiversity protection strategy is a long-term plan. In relation to this, it is necessary to approach this matter very carefully, both in terms of the effectiveness of the measures which are planned, but also in terms of the costs. Subsidies and other support require efficient verification to eliminate sources of funding which are harmful to the environment. Emphasis should be placed on introducing modern and environment-friendly methods. The European Conservatives and Reformists Group has made its decision on the report conditional on whether a number of amendments will be included, concerning, amongst others, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">EU law should give similar treatment to the problem of protecting biodiversity to that afforded in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Another way in which biodiversity protection should be legally strengthened is by a comprehensive EU directive on soil.

All this, but especially the last point, should be taken very seriously.</p>

      <p sl="es">In short, if we are to trust following the resounding failure we suffered in 2010, we will have to show a lot of good intentions with regard to 2020, the Commission will have to get moving and pay heed to this report, which is a good report in that it cares about the future of generations to come and contains very specific measures, which simply need to be put into effect, so that protecting our biodiversity is not a joke but rather a very serious issue that this Parliament must tackle on behalf of all European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I thank the rapporteur for his work on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are two failures. You mentioned one of them, Mr Gerbrandy – the market failure – but there has also been a communications failure. Despite all the big words and heavy debates in this House, none of the citizenship in general hears or understands what we are talking about: so we have failed. I am glad the Commissioner is nodding in agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the failure of the markets, it is acknowledged in the debate about the common agriculture policy that there is no reward for public goods in terms of the price we pay for food, but we have not found the formula for correcting the market, and we need to do that. Commissioner, could I suggest that there may be a possibility – which has not been thought through in the proposals on greening the CAP – for us to develop a market in green entitlements, and that, for example in ecological focus areas, it may be possible to establish some sort of marketplace as a first step towards a price for public goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are aware, however, in relation to the bogs in Ireland and that particular problem, how extremely difficult it is when citizens are asked to change their behaviour for the good of the environment. So we have a long way to go to implement all these recommendations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy. This is a very good report and it gives us guidelines as to how we should act in forthcoming legislative procedures and during major reform processes. The litmus test will come when we discuss agricultural reform. Many of the speeches today have already made this clear. This is where we will have the opportunity to do more to promote biodiversity and to show our other partners, for example, at the Rio+20 conference, that we take this subject seriously.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Heads of State or Government agreed in 2001 that biodiversity must be protected. Unfortunately, we have failed to achieve this objective. The window of opportunity is gradually closing and it is time for us to act. The problem will not be resolved solely by this strategy. The whole issue must be incorporated into the reform of fisheries and agriculture policy and given a more concrete form.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, agriculture is currently facing the challenge of higher production with limited resources and as little damage to the environment as possible. The report on the biodiversity strategy states correctly the importance of this double challenge.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, several remarks should be made regarding aspects related to the future common agricultural policy. The so-called greening of the CAP is certainly needed and welcome, but the form in which it was proposed will lead to a decline in the capacity of the agro-food sector to be more competitive and follow the path to sustainable growth. The percentage of 30% allocated to greening is disproportionate, taking into account the context of budget austerity. Giving up the cultivation of 7% of land is not a suitable decision in the circumstances of an increasing food demand. Crop diversification is virtually impossible for small land owners. Last but not least, the system involves too much red tape and huge costs. Agriculture can make an important contribution to the preservation of biodiversity, but related policies should be selected taking into account long-term food safety in particular.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, biodiversity or biological variety forms the foundation of our lives. This is something that we have inherited and we have the major responsibility of ensuring that this inheritance remains intact and of passing it on to subsequent generations. This is not just about preserving biodiversity, but also about the sustainable use of resources. Nature conservation policies can only be successful in cooperation with agriculture. Some animals and plants can only live in areas managed by man. One example of this is the Apollo butterfly, which lives only on well-managed vineyards on steep hillsides. In wild habitats, it cannot survive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our objective is to ensure that we have a secure supply of high-quality, varied foodstuffs and that we protect biodiversity. The current common agricultural policy (CAP) imposes stringent requirements for healthy, varied and sustainable production, based on the precautionary principle. We are currently in the midst of the discussions and I believe that the committee chair, Mr Groote, is right. We need to hold talks about the CAP and we should not anticipate them today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Potočnik, the subject of bee mortality has been mentioned today. This is an area which I have been involved in for some time. Many beekeepers and agricultural producers are very concerned about the significant reduction in the number of bees and other pollinating insects in Europe. We have called on the Commission on several occasions to take action in this area. We are convinced that this is due, on the one hand, to the incorrect use of pesticides and, on the other, to the genuinely harmful pesticides currently on the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, and this is a personal point, I would like to ask you to ensure in future that those Member States which do not want to use genetically modified seed for the sake of their citizens are in a position to keep their soil and their food chain free from genetically modified organisms.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the Commissioner speaks eloquently about his commitment to protect biodiversity. The Commissioner and the rapporteur defend the Natura 2000 network, which is an important instrument. I come from Galicia, a region which is rich in biodiversity; a green region that thrives on agriculture and fishing. The Commissioner has received many parliamentary questions from me. The Commissioner talks about providing economically for the Natura network with political commitments and funding. Does he intend to enforce the applicable EU legislation so that the governments which are responsible although, in many cases, they are, in fact, irresponsible, comply with that legislation? That is the case in my region. Unfortunately, instances where the Natura 2000 network is not complied with both in terms of the conservation or expansion of protected natural areas or natural habitats often lead to irreversible environmental degradation, fires, oil spills such as the Prestige oil spill and serious situations such as the installation of large-scale aquaculture plants in green maritime areas.</p>

However, existing import regulations allow other countries outside the European Union to export their production to the European Union, including products that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and pesticides and herbicides prohibited in Europe. In this way, we are giving our backing in Europe to the proliferation of GMOs and harmful chemical substances. We need much stricter rules and restrictions on the use and export of GMOs.</p>

The annual costs arising from biodiversity loss amount to billions for the global economy, undermining economies, business prospects and opportunities to fight poverty. I encourage the Commission and Member States to further promote a common approach to nature preservation throughout the European Union, including the outermost regions and the overseas territories of Member States. I emphasise the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity protection and conservation in the development, implementation and funding of all other EU policies, including those on agriculture, forestry, fisheries, regional development and cohesion, energy, industry, transport, tourism, development cooperation, research and innovation in order to make the EU’s sectoral and budgetary policies more coherent and ensure that it honours its binding commitments on biodiversity protection.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, diversity is an emotively favourable word and, of course, we are all in favour of it, but unfortunately, we mean different things by it. I have a book on British wild animals from 1947 which welcomed the addition of the grey squirrel to British wildlife in the interests of diversity. I have some good news for the writer of the book and for the grey squirrel: it is to be found everywhere in Britain now.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the red squirrel, I have some less welcome news: your habitats have been taken and you will soon be extinct. Now there are some people in Britain who defend the grey squirrel, saying it was born and brought up in Britain and would have a British passport if squirrels had passports – indeed it is not really a grey squirrel at all but simply a native red squirrel which happens to have grey fur.</p>
      <p sl="en">1947 was only 65 years ago, yet the squirrel population has undergone such enormous changes, and the human population of Britain has also changed enormously. This just shows how the wrong kind of diversity can lead very quickly to the displacement of native populations.</p>

    <intervention id="5-078-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I agree with all those who believe that, basically, the major problem with taking care of biodiversity is insufficient awareness. I think that if we were to be frank and compare how many people today understand – even among us politicians – the importance of climate change versus biodiversity, we would be astonished at how many are aware of the success of the Durban conference and how few are aware of the success of the Nagoya conference – and, by the way, the Nagoya conference was much more successful: it produced concrete agreements in the biodiversity area. So we all have work to do, when it comes both to Europe and to the international environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things which will happen this year after Rio will be a conference in Hyderabad, which will also focus largely on resource-mobilisation and the things which were not entirely settled in Nagoya. I would also urge you in the European Parliament to help recognise this important issue, which needs to be addressed in the Member States. On 14 May, a ministerial-level conference will be held at which we will try to ensure that this issue can be properly addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think when we discuss the future, there are basically three major core issues which we cannot ignore: one of course is climate change; another is biodiversity, and the third is the question of resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we talk about issues – and this is a typical one – I think that the longer-term view, the visions and the strategies are particularly important. As Mr Eickhout said, the importance of those decisions is that we do not make mistakes today, because if we do, we should not dream about the future. We need those decisions so that we do not take the wrong decisions today. One of the things that many of you underlined, when it comes to coordination among policies, is that if you asked today – to take a clear example – somebody who is an environmentalist: ‘what is the long-term interest in fishing?’, he would say: ‘sustainable fishing’. Ask a fisherman what his long-term interest in fishing is, and he will also say sustainable fishing. So they agree perfectly. When it comes to the short term, they would immediately disagree. One would ask for more fishing and another one would ask for less fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think it is very important that we keep an eye on those long-term agendas, and that we base them very much on the scientific knowledge that we should all create and develop.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fourth thing which I would like to mention is in the context of the common agricultural policy, because many of you have mentioned that. The protection of biodiversity is very much in the farmers’ interest – and by the way, again from the longer-term point of view, they know that perfectly well – and what we are suggesting in the proposals of the common agricultural policy is basically that they should deliver some kind of public good. In the case of other EU policies (for example, water policy), they have to respect them, otherwise they will be punished by paying penalties later on because of non-compliance. We wish to pay them in advance so that they do not pollute or hamper biodiversity. That is the essence of the new common agricultural policy. Working together: that is how we understand the mainstreaming or integration of policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to tell you some bare facts on soil biodiversity. It is widely recognised by scientists that about one quarter of biological diversity on the planet is hosted by soils. So the European Commission, in its recent report on the implementation of the soil thematic strategy five years after its adoption, said that soil degradation continues in the European Union, and soil biodiversity is not spared. These are the bare facts, and we in the Commission believe that the best way would be to adopt comprehensive legislation to protect the soils.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two slightly more specific comments. It is not the case that it is the EU which is determining Natura 2000. Natura 2000 is determined on the scientific criteria which we have all agreed together, and it is the Member States themselves which then define the areas on the basis of those criteria. We then jointly check if they are correctly applying the criteria which we have jointly agreed upon. That is the procedure. By the way, I come from a country which has 36% of its territory protected under Natura 2000, so if anyone does not believe that this has real potential for the future, I would invite you to visit my country in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last thing that I should mention is connected to the last speaker’s comment. Part of our strategy for the future is a strategy for invasive species; we recognise that. This is one of the six strategic issues that we want to address, and this year you can expect a proposal from the Commission to address that issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude. The other day, we were guests in Denmark, where we met a farmer who was extremely successful. He told us that he was doing everything in cooperation with nature and respecting nature, and he said: ‘if you Ministers want to remember just one message coming from farms today, remember that biodiversity and nature have had millions of years of experience of how to deal with the questions which we humans are struggling with, and we are stupid enough to destroy it and stupid enough not to use it’.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, allow me, first of all, to thank my fellow Members for the very broad level of support for our report on biodiversity. Unfortunately, there is one exception and that is Mr Hartong, who, to make matters worse, is from my own country. He did not even have the decency to stay until the end of the debate. He started his speech talking about laughing, and indeed, I saw many smiling faces as he spoke, only, unfortunately for him, those were smiles of pity and embarrassment on his behalf.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to give him one piece of advice: let him go and live on Mars for a while. On the red planet, he will have absolutely no problems with the European Commission and perhaps, from the red planet, he can look at the blue planet and see, in particular, the great importance and power of the diversity on that blue planet and why we human beings can live on earth and not on Mars. Maybe somebody could pass that on to him.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I believe that, in addition to the broad support for the report, it is also important that we have demonstrated in this debate very strong political support for a stronger protection of biodiversity. That is not only important in order for my report to be adopted but, more especially, in order to send a political signal to both the European Commission and the Council in the further development of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is a non-legislative report. Obviously, though, it will only begin to matter at the point at which we start discussing legislation. It will then concern other policy areas as well. I am very pleased with my colleagues’ positive words about that, but I would like to remind them of those words when we actually start making specific decisions on the new agricultural policy, the new fisheries policy, the new cohesion policy and, let us not forget, the development policy. Those are the issues that really matter and, then, today’s positive words will hopefully be worth just as much as they are today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As it is drafted, it is impossible for me to vote in favour of the report on the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020. Indeed, it is inconceivable for our institution to support the idea that hunting has a detrimental impact on biodiversity. On the contrary, the 7 million hunters within the European Union are involved on a daily basis in action to promote biodiversity. Through their activity on the ground, they contribute their expertise, their time and their resources to maintaining a favourable environment for the development of fauna and flora. Through their passion, they acquire a knowledge of nature which is precious to the citizens of the European Union with whom they share the same value of preserving their natural capital. By the same token, the idea contained in paragraph 35 that the European Union should establish an ‘environmental inspection force’ is not acceptable. This proposal runs counter to the subsidiarity principle and should not be financed by the European Union in the current economic context. For other reasons, such as the image of farmers as ‘guardians’ of the landscape, I oppose the adoption of this report, the approach of which is biased.</p>

      <p sl="cs">There are many reasons why the biodiversity protection targets were missed in 2010, but the main one was that biodiversity was not a priority in all areas of decision making and all sectors of the economy. I therefore welcome the resolution of the European Parliament, which recognises that the solution is not just to come up with a new strategy for protecting biodiversity, but, above all, to incorporate biodiversity into the debate on policies currently under negotiation which might have a decisive impact on biodiversity. The common agricultural policy (CAP) should not focus exclusively on securing sufficient quantities of high-quality food and rural development through subsidies to farmers. The CAP is also a key instrument for protecting biodiversity. It is therefore necessary to ensure consistency across the entire system, and to clearly identify subsidies having a negative impact on the environment and to cancel these subsidies as quickly as possible. The reform of the common fisheries policy now under discussion will be of similar importance, and it must immediately restrict destructive forms of fishing. A quicker start must also be made on debating the soil directive, as we need to reduce soil pollution and pay more attention to protecting soil biodiversity. It is the same story here as with rainforests, coral reefs and inland freshwater bodies, which are so much under threat that the remedy, if at all possible, is extremely costly, because ecosystems transform into other, less productive states from which they can be brought back only with great difficulty, if at all.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Pollinating insects, in particular wild and domesticated honeybees, which are responsible for the pollination of 80% of European flowering plants, play a key role in maintaining biological diversity. The decline in bee populations experienced for years can be attributed to numerous causes, as I called attention to in my report adopted last year on ‘Honeybee health and the challenges of the beekeeping sector’. The lack of veterinary products, the excessive use of certain plant protection products and their active substances (in particular, those belonging to the neonicotinoid family), certain intensive agricultural production methods and the damaging effects of climate change all contribute to that decline. The greatest problem, however, is that there are insufficient EU funds for scientific research in the field of beekeeping and data collection at European level. Our knowledge of the European honeybee stock is incomplete, and scientific results allowing responsible decisions to be made are obtained with great difficulty. I therefore welcome the fact that the report, in line with my earlier report, calls on the Commission to increase significantly the support provided for the beekeeping sector. Honeybee health is in the interest of both European farmers and environmentalists, and serves the interests of both agribusiness and environmental protection. Honeybees generate public goods by means of pollination, which is why it is right for the new common agricultural policy coming into effect from 2014 to give the sector greater support than to date.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wants to introduce a 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) in the European Union. It would not make sense for us to give up our efforts to improve the quality of the environment and of health in Europe when the 6th EAP comes to an end in June. However, the 7th EAP must not be a copy of the 6th programme. We have come much further along the road and we are facing much bigger challenges.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to take a new approach in the 7th EAP: a horizontal approach covering all other areas of policy. We are exposed to systemic risks. Mr Potočnik, you have just mentioned the fact that climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the shortage of resources are all challenges which cannot be overcome by traditional environmental policy alone. We need to involve all the other portfolios and all the other policy areas in the EU and, in particular, energy and transport policy, agriculture and fisheries policy, cohesion policy and, most importantly, economic and financial policy. I would like to emphasise this point, because this is the most difficult aspect. How can we ensure that the finance and economy ministers treat greening as a central issue within their areas?</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament has drafted 80 paragraphs containing proposals for the content and the procedure for a 7th EAP and these include calls for the abolition of subsidies which harm the environment. Following the greening of tax policy, we must incorporate external costs in our prices. The principle that the polluter pays must be applied gradually. As part of our macro-economic controls, we also need to monitor sustainability within the European Semester. We have come up with many other ideas in this area. Europe’s environmental footprint as a whole is far too large. If all the 7 billion people on this planet today and the 9 billion that there will be by the middle of the century were to use as much energy and as many resources as we do, we would need two planets, not just one. We know that there are limits to the resources which our planet can provide. For this reason, we need to make major cuts in our resource consumption. The 7th EAP must open the door to a green economy and to a policy of resource efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to focus, in particular, on urban environments. More and more people are living in large conurbations and in these areas, we can set a good example of resource management and resource efficiency. Green cities are our objective in Europe. There are many good examples and best practices which must be applied everywhere. Of course, protecting the environment should also help us to protect people’s health. We must send out a clear message to the public that protecting the environment and public health form an integral part of the 7th EAP. This will help to ensure that it gains acceptance. There are still a number of difficulties in this area. Air pollution levels are still too high and noise pollution is a huge problem. Noise is an issue that has been neglected and completely underrated in our environmental policy. There are still many toxic chemicals that make their way into the environment and have an impact on health. Nanomaterials and other new materials need careful investigation and also present us with new challenges.</p>
      <p sl="de">The best legislation and the best programmes are useless if they are not implemented. The 7th EAP must resolve the problem of the implementation deficit. Ultimately, I believe that Europe must send a message to the world that we need sustainable management. Otherwise, the human race will not survive on earth.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his work on this report, which comes at the right time. As you know, the Commission is busy preparing the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) for adoption before the end of this year. I can say that many of the ideas which you mentioned in the introduction are ideas which we are considering for inclusion in the 7th Environment Action Programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU environment policy has been consolidated under the 6th Environment Action Programme. We now have legislation covering all areas except soil. In the meantime, we have developed a number of new initiatives – including on climate, biodiversity and resource efficiency – which set objectives for 2020 and contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 7th EAP should pull all these together in an overarching, coherent framework. It should also look beyond 2020 and put in place the conditions necessary to secure a resource-efficient, low-carbon future in which natural capital is protected, valued and substantially restored. Ensuring all this will require more coherent policy making and enhanced integration of the environment into other policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was pleased to see implementation as the first priority highlighted in your report. As you know, I made this one of my top priorities in my nomination hearing before this House and from the beginning of my mandate. Implementation failures are a major stumbling block to delivering the benefits we seek from environmental legislation. They cost us around EUR 50 billion per year, lead to distortions in the single market and make it more costly to tackle environmental challenges down the road. After all, these challenges do not simply resolve themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last month, the Commission presented ideas on how to improve the situation which will be further developed in the 7th EAP. I also agree that the 7th EAP should focus on the contribution of environment policy to better health and well-being. More needs to be done to tackle challenges arising from pollution that are not yet being adequately addressed. There are still some concerns that our current policy framework may not adequately cater for new and emerging threats. This will obviously need to be further explored.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ongoing reviews of our water and air legislation will help inform the future direction of both policies. I also fully agree with you that the urban environment is an important dimension of our policy. The 7th EAP should promote and support efforts by urban communities to play a leadership role. The international dimension of environment policy also needs to feature prominently in the 7th EAP, which will also need to reflect the outcome of Rio+20 and provide for the timely implementation of EU international commitments under the UNFCCC. We need global climate action consistent with the objective of keeping the global average temperature increase below 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels. I also agree that the 7th EAP should provide a framework for the transition to a low-carbon economy beyond our 2020 targets. This work has already started with the 2020 Low Carbon Road map, which sets out a pathway with milestones for a cost-effective, gradual transition and identifies essential enabling technologies and instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">As always, the commitment of all stakeholders concerned is fundamental to the success of many programmes. We need to mobilise actors at all levels and in all relevant sectors to do their part. I count on your support for this. I will be following today’s debate with keen interest and I would like to thank you again for your report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, nature, as a resource and legacy for future generations, must be a permanent concern for all citizens. Environmental policy never acts alone, but reflects the interests of the entire civil society in this respect, which is proven by the existence of numerous environmental organisations. On the other hand, the industry holds back when environmental objectives may require a set of limitations to be imposed on industrial competitiveness, affecting economic growth. These elements only highlight the need for a concerted approach at European level that must take into account local and regional specifics. Europe needs an active and integrated environmental policy, able to meet all the challenges faced, including economic challenges, but also facilitate improved cooperation between regions and across borders, especially with non-Member States. Pollution has no boundaries and all stakeholders in third countries must become involved in order to safeguard nature, ecosystems and protected areas, regardless of their location.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leinen, thank you for the work that we have carried out together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union needs a manifesto, a common political vision with regard to the major environmental challenges for 2020 and beyond. That is why it is so useful to launch a 7th Environment Action Programme harmonising the existing financial frameworks and mobilising new funding resources. This programme should ensure that the EU’s environmental strategies are consistent with, and integrated into, sectoral policies, whether these relate to agriculture, fishing, research and innovation, health, transport, regional development or land management and, of course, urban policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In spite of the economic crisis that has been giving the European Union a hard time, we must not give in to a short-term vision and abandon all ambition in terms of the environment and climate. To do nothing would be fatal. The issues are too important, particularly with regard to efficient resource use and valuing natural capital. We must therefore invest resolutely in the sustainable economy and eco-innovation, which are sources of growth, competitiveness and jobs. It is up to us to promote eco-design and recycling, but also environmental labelling of products in order to avoid waste and poor consumption choices.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot overlook this environmental lesson that European citizens need. The Environment Action Programme is a political programming instrument, but it is also a communication tool. It must provide the readability and predictability that is necessary not only for national and local authorities and citizens, but also for entrepreneurs and investors with regard to the European Union’s environmental choices. European regulation must not become a punishment or a vice.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the 10-year Environment Action Programme has helped to increase the focus on the connection between the environment and health. It has, in turn, contributed to comprehensive legislation on chemicals, pesticides and water. This is something of which we can be proud, but we cannot be satisfied.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, we must, in future, ensure that there is greater consistency between the formulation of environmental policy and its actual implementation. There have been clear shortcomings when it comes to monitoring and inspections to ensure that environmental legislation is actually being introduced and implemented in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, and very importantly, we must have the courage to go further. I am therefore hoping for an ambitious 7th programme, despite the economic crisis, or perhaps precisely because we need the high environmental goals for economic reasons, too. They could be a tool for creating jobs and sustainable growth.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Environmental aspects must therefore be included in all relevant policy areas, and these are many. For example, efforts to abolish environmentally harmful subsidies must continue. A more sustainable use of the land would reduce the pressure on ecosystems and the services they provide. At international level, the EU should also increase its potential with strict environmental standards and environment-related skills and products.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The issue of the environment is quite simply not just a condiment to have on the side of all of our so-called ordinary policies. Environmental policy is the actual yeast in the dough. The new Environment Action Programme must demonstrate that that is indeed the case.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Commissioner referred just now to the meeting of the Informal Environment Council in Denmark this week, so I would like to start with a quote from the meeting’s press release:</p>
      <p sl="nl">‘There is no other way out of the economic crisis than through a green economy, which will strengthen the development of new and greener technologies, resource reductions, and the protection of our nature and the biodiversity. A green transition will create millions of jobs and make Europe more sustainable and competitive’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I really have to congratulate both the Commissioner and the Danish Presidency, including Minister Ida Auken, on this, for me, extremely positive and visionary report. It has been a while since we last heard such positive sounds from the Council. I therefore hope that the Council will follow up on this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we have just discussed biodiversity in this debate and, next month, we will be talking about resource efficiency in a plenary meeting. In my view, the 7th Environment Action Programme should determine the priorities for 2020 with the associated targets, indicators and actions. I also believe that we need to look beyond 2050 and lay down a vision for a green Europe; the Informal Environment Council has, in any case, already made a start.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The 7th Environment Action Programme should be an overarching framework that will streamline all targets and actions into EU policy because that is the only way we can preserve nature for our children and our economy. Indeed, as I have said many times: greening and economy go hand in hand.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would very much like to thank rapporteur Leinen for his excellent work and I would call on the Commission to really speed up the new proposal in order to stop the gap between the 6th and the 7th Environment Action Programme becoming too wide. Today, we have shown that we in this House can inspire you with excellent ideas.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, thank you to rapporteur Leinen for this report on the 7th Environment Action Programme. Indeed, we, too, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, believe that the 7th EAP is badly needed for our environment. First of all, Mr Gerbrandy, in order to map out the vision for 2020, but importantly, for 2050 as well, because we need to decide, as Europe, in what kind of economy we want to live.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The choice, indeed, is not about how green the economy will be, but about making sure that it is green. Only an economy that efficiently manages its natural resources will survive and it is crucial for Europe that we move in that direction. That is why we need vision, as well as action programmes, so that we can start to take these steps now. For the same reason, we also fully support this report’s focus on implementation, integration and the international dimension.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let me first briefly consider implementation: time and again, we see how important implementation is. If we look at what can go wrong with oil drilling in the North Sea, and if we also look at what kinds of problems we in the Netherlands, otherwise a very prosperous country, have in simply protecting nature in the Western Scheldt, only then do we realise that we desperately need the European Commission to show us the way.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Next, integration, the green economy: though everyone has called for it here, it really means something fundamental. We need to look beyond just gross domestic product. We have to look at broader indicators and I therefore call on the Commission to hurry up on that score, to look beyond GDP.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the green economy also means that we need to start thinking about what our energy system will look like in the future. This means that we therefore need more targets for 2030 than just the famous low carbon target. We also have to set targets for energy saving and for renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the international dimension. Everything we do in Europe has consequences for developing countries. We should always keep that in mind, because, without those countries, the green economy will never get off the ground internationally. Let us make a real start on that one at Rio+20.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the intervention of civilisation in ecosystems causes irreversible environmental destruction, and therefore our efforts to eliminate large-scale damage to the environment are fully legitimate and necessary.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The 6th Environment Action Programme, which has provided us with a framework for our environmental policy on the environment, is ending in July this year, and therefore it is necessary to deal with the continuation and continuity of European environmental policy. In the upcoming 7th EAP, it will be necessary, given our experience up till now, to put more emphasis on significantly strengthening legal regulations concerning the environment and on the gradual integration of environmental objectives into all sectoral policies. Greater emphasis will also have to be placed on the cross-border dimension of environmental protection. The broad thematic strategies should be reflected in legislation for defining goals and timetables in order to effectively monitor and evaluate their consequences. In addition to global environmental policy, we should also work on specific integrated strategies for each individual geographic area or urban areas, which would take into account the specific characteristics of their ecosystems.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In any case, the 7th Environment Action Programme should be better structured, more precise, more ambitious and more effective in order to make best use of the experience gained over many years of EU environmental policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the general perception of environmental action programmes is that their purpose is to establish important medium- and long-term goals for European environmental policy. However, the evaluation of the 6th Environment Action Programme (EAP) has shown that the programme has fallen below expectations, despite the fact that it is the first EAP that was drawn up jointly by the Council and the European Parliament using the new ordinary legislative procedure. It sets the priorities for climate change, biodiversity, natural resources, waste, health and food quality.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has become clear that we cannot achieve these goals, largely because the EAP was not implemented correctly in the Member States. However, we did pave the way for this development ourselves. In the introduction to the report, there is a reference to a communication with the title ‘Europe 2020 – a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’. Then there is the road map for a green Europe, which will soon be presented, and the road map for a resource-efficient Europe. The list goes on and on. I cannot mention them all here, because I would run out of time.</p>
      <p sl="de">This plethora of parallel strategies, action plans and specific legislative initiatives has resulted, and is still resulting, in a failure to ensure the necessary coherence between the individual policy areas. Instead of constantly creating new indicators which have to be checked and which lead to more bureaucracy but bring no useful results, we need to take into consideration in our decision-making processes the developments in society as a whole. Only then can the policies be implemented in an appropriate way. My opinion differs from that of the rapporteur who has said that the EAP must take a horizontal approach. That is not correct. It should act as an umbrella. It must not be applied horizontally, but on a sector-by-sector basis. It needs to play an overarching role with other areas beneath it, rather than there being a whole series of strategies, plans and initiatives running in parallel which do not take a coordinated approach and, therefore, will not produce successful results.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, thank you, Mr Leinen, for your report and the major focus on a broad approach for implementation and integration. Thank you, too, Commissioner, for the attention you have given to this and your preparations for a 7th Environment Action Programme.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Leinen is absolutely right when he says that this is not just about the environment but, above all, about all parts of the economy; about transport, about health care and, generally, about economic policy. The environment is economic policy, now and especially in the future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to draw your attention to two specific issues that I am worried about. Very often it is the case that we enthusiastically fix upon a new technology which does not always prove to be the right one to produce the results we desire. So, we have paid a great deal of attention to biomass and it is true, of course, that the economy of the future will increasingly be based on biological resources. However, we have been too enthusiastic about biomass and this has resulted in a large proportion of biomass disappearing in the oven right now, whereas it could also be used for higher applications than energy alone.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore believe that you are right, Commissioner, and that Mr Leinen is right. A lot of implementation, yes, but we need to ask ourselves, in particular, how are we going to achieve that with biomass? Sustainable use. How should we process biomass so that this really leads to CO2 reduction, so that it does not lead to greater water consumption, and to finish: nanotechnology, too, has many …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, our rapporteur, Jo Leinen, mentioned how important it is for Parliament and the EU to keep the environment at the top of their agenda. It is not easy in these times of crisis and austerity when these concerns are often put on the back burner, both in national policies and in the media. I think that the presidential election campaign in France is a good example of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my view, there are two priorities, two axes, in order to do better with less money: firstly, we must move towards greater coherence. This is mentioned in item 3 of the resolution. In short, that is what I would call ‘tobacco’ case-law: the European Union must remove all subsidies on products that have harmful effects on the environment and biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, another axis, which has hardly been mentioned so far, is the better taking into account of environmental health. We have been saying this since 2003 and since my report on the Environment and Health Action Plan. We must reduce our people’s exposure to cocktails of chemical products that have serious effects on health. That is why it is essential to include this environmental aspect in plans to combat cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity and so many chronic illnesses which thrive in unhealthy environments.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, for his excellent work. As my fellow Members have already said, the EU’s 7th Environment Action Programme should be adopted as soon as possible. We are forever making decisions that affect the environment under other headings, as the report says.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One of them is agricultural policy, which affects, for instance, biodiversity, bodies of water and climate. For example, the future of the Baltic Sea environment will largely be addressed through decisions on common agricultural policy. After all, the Baltic is one of the most polluted seas in the world, and its major problem is eutrophication, which is mainly the result of agriculture. If the quantities of phosphorus or nitrogen that are washed off our fields into the rivers and seas are not reduced radically, there is no hope for any improvement in the Baltic Sea, and rafts of toxic blue-green algae will, in future, float on its surface. The environment and the economy are not in opposition, just as the Commission’s report out this week says.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not speak for long as I would just like to mention a few things in the short time at my disposal.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that this 7th Environment Action Programme could doubtless prove to be a useful instrument, but only provided it is based on a long-term view that takes account of the need to maintain a solid industrial base in Europe. This is essential in order to maintain a dignified and acceptable employment level.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some aspects concern me. I think that it is a top priority for this programme to ensure that the existing rules are implemented more effectively before setting further binding objectives. Also, I am strongly convinced that in order to address current environmental challenges, we must look to future environmental policies that are grounded on solid evidence and the latest scientific knowledge.</p>
      <p sl="it">Paragraph 24, which talks about an ‘ecological footprint’ as an absolute indicator, concerns me; this represents an indicator, an empirical model of reality, not reality itself, and we must keep this very much in mind. It has many limitations: it tells us how much we are affecting the environment, but it absolutely does not, for example, assess the quality of the environment, so my concerns remain and I urge everyone to bear them in mind.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, one of my first initiatives as an MEP was to ask the Commission why they had no plans to continue the 6th Environment Action Programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">At that time, there were some who said that the instruments and authorities already at our disposal were sufficient and that perhaps it was not necessary. Today, with three months left to go, as Mr Leinen has rightly pointed out, this Parliament is clamouring for the Commission to tell it that we need a common link for community policies, a common environment strategy, a reference, like the action programmes, and that without this, we cannot function.</p>
      <p sl="es">I was in Catalonia recently, where I was able to follow first hand the recycling of refrigerators, for example, and I was very pleased to see that it is already possible to recycle 95%. That set of policies for recycling and waste needs coordinating, as paragraph 32 rightly states, in order to get to 100% recycling.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we want to be coherent in relation to the 2020 objectives, clearly we need there to be an action programme, like the one proposed, and we need it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am glad that one of the proposals involves the programme contributing to ensuring adequate funding of research, development and innovation (R+D+i). In this context, I take the opportunity to denounce those governments that, under the pretext of the crisis and using the tool of austerity, are feeding on scientists and researchers, cutting back on R+D+i and, accordingly, making cuts to this Europe’s future.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we ought to say is that, in this matter, austerity and crisis provide no justification, are not acceptable as alibis, and that the action programme to support the financing of R+D+i must be motivated by tremendous political will and ambition.</p>

We need a coherent strategy, and this programme must integrate our vision on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, it is crucial to ensure that the legislation we adopt will be implemented and we need goals and specific deadlines for achieving goals.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Environmental indicators should be better correlated with existing realities in Europe.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is important that resource efficiency is also included in the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP), which is what we have been discussing today. I hope that we will vote in plenary in the same way as we voted in the committee and that the Rio+20 conference will be a great success. Following the discussions with the environment ministers this week, I am in a very positive mood. We should design the 7th EAP accordingly and include the concrete decisions which we hope will be made in Rio, in other words, the international dimension.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as doing business sustainably is concerned, we need to introduce an end-to-end approach, for example, in car manufacturing. We must consider the car from production right through to recycling. To achieve this, we need a legislative framework. The 7th EAP is a good location for this framework, which can then be applied when the relevant legislation is revised.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think one of the most important points in this debate is the conflict between our long-term objectives and the short-term concerns of citizens. When we talk about sustainable production and consumption, there is not enough emphasis on what we mean by ‘sustainable’. If you listen to the debate on jobs and growth, which is so important to so many who are unemployed, the question of sustainability is not part of that discussion. We need to convince people that the words we say here will actually be reflected in an increase in jobs if we adopt the sustainability model and the resource-efficiency agenda which has already been discussed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I would make the point that, while it is absolutely vital to implement existing legislation, we also need to review it. There is a proposal in the CAP reform to extend cross-compliance to include water framework and pesticides legislation, which will be a very big burden on agriculture in terms of bureaucracy, but it is something we need to discuss in the reform proposals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the Members for their support and clarify that for me, there was never any question of having or not having the 7th Environment Action Programme. I was always in favour of it, but there were some things which were – according to the legislation – simply vital. One of these was that we do a full report of the existing 6th Environment Action Programme and that we learn the lessons, which, in a way, is logical.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even if there will be some time between the 6th and the 7th Environment Action Programmes, I can assure you that we are listening to you carefully and are implementing many of the things that you have underlined. For example, even though, this year, you will have a very comprehensive water proposal on the table, we will also be addressing the question of phosphorous and other issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of the questions concerning biodiversity that we had discussed previously – resource efficiency and so on – have been dealt with over the last two years, so we are really trying to be active. But, at the same time, we very much understand that we need a longer-term and coherent framework on which we can all agree and cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to say that we are much closer to a common understanding of the shape and substance of the 7th Environment Action Programme after this week. At the beginning of the week, we discussed it in informal Council in Denmark, and today we are discussing it here. My conclusion is that the views are converging and the common understanding of what the programme should actually include, what it should address and how it should be shaped, is emerging. The public consultation is also still open. It will go on until May, and we are expecting to receive input from that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to sum up in one sentence the dilemma which sometimes exists between green growth and so-called brown growth. We would really not be discussing green growth if everything were alright and if brown growth were not problematic. Brown growth in itself is limited in terms of growth capacity, and many businesses today are starting to understand that and to shift their activities. If we do not take into consideration some of the limited resources that we share today on the planet, like water, land, oceans and ecosystems, we will simply hit the walls of development ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the green economy is inevitable. It is simply logical. To give you just one example: if we continue with business as usual, then in the year 2030 – which is not so far from now – we will need 40% more water than we actually have on Earth. The situation is simply not going to go away. That is something which cannot happen and cannot work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, some of you mentioned indicators and GDP. I fully agree. There is a well-known saying: what you do not measure, you do not take into consideration when you are creating your policies and your decisions. I think we need them quite urgently.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I think the situation we have today is quite different from the situation of ten years ago, when we were discussing and adopting the 6th Environment Action Programme. Much more legislation is in place, but – on the other hand – we understand much better some of the challenges that have emerged as a result of knowledge. Some things that are much more obvious today than they were a decade ago inform our decision on what we will have to incorporate into the 7th Environment Action Programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is obvious that climate, biodiversity and resources will still have to be our main focus, but we should not replicate – double or triple – the messages. I think we should simply focus on creating a synthesis, a longer-term view and visions. I have heard from many of you that we should pay attention to urban issues, health, chemicals, the air and a strong international dimension. I basically agree. That is no problem at all, but I would underline that our main focus should be on two major things. One is implementation of the things that are already completed or which concern legislation where we are really lagging behind. Nothing will improve if the things we agree are not implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament – as a legislative body – should be very much interested in ensuring that the things to which you agree and give your blessing are implemented in practice. I will certainly follow up on that. The second point is integration, which some of you call coherence. I think it is of the utmost importance that all our policies take into consideration the fact that we are living in a very interconnected and interdependent world. The next financial MFF financial proposal will need to focus on and give proper attention to the questions we are discussing today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank you again, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Jo Leinen. I think we are on course for some good results.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the debate has shown that there is a consensus in favour of the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) within the European Parliament. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach this consensus. I would also like to thank Mr Potočnik, who took the initiative within the Commission, because not everyone there supported the 7th EAP at first sight. It is clear that there was a certain level of resistance. Following the debate in the Council of Environment Ministers and in the European Parliament, it is clear how useful and how important a 7th EAP can be, because it brings together all the objectives which were previously spread across different strategies and road maps. The amalgamation of these objectives, the message that Europe’s environmental footprint must be reduced and the measures needed to achieve this are the main points of the 7th EAP.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say once again that we need to address our calls to the finance and economy ministers. I hope that the report will not be watered down during the vote later today. We must call for the greening of tax policy and economic policy because we will not be able to make our economy sustainable by means of environmental policy alone. This point has been made in many of today’s speeches.</p>
      <p sl="de">The environmental strategy must be reflected in the finance strategy. We will soon be debating the medium-term financial plan up to 2020 and the Commission has proposed putting aside for climate change and sustainability 20% of the billions of euro available. I believe that this should be a minimum and I hope that Parliament can increase this figure during the negotiations. We must not allow 80% of the funding to be devoted to areas that go against the environment and only 20% to be used to protect the environment. Overall, this has been an important debate and we are looking forward to your draft, Mr Potočnik. This will go into the ordinary legislative procedure where it will be finalised. We will help to ensure that the result is an ambitious programme.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today, we are discussing further EU environment policy guidelines. This area of policy is relatively new and rapidly developing, and it is therefore no surprise that new areas of regulation appear with every Environment Action Programme that is approved, and existing regulation is often tightened during the life of the programme. Both new scientific data and technical possibilities and accidents that have an impact on the environment mean that the concept of a ‘high level of environmental protection’ constantly needs to be reviewed, raising the bar ever higher. One of the aspects that we should highlight in the 7th Environment Action Programme, which is still in preparation, is improving the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process, ensuring its independence. This process, which started as a voluntary assessment of planned activity, has become an integral part of the planning process. Nevertheless, the existing arrangements do not guarantee that this process will proceed in an objective manner and will be independent from the customer – in the EU, there are numerous cases where there are reasonable doubts as to whether the EIA process was truly transparent.

      <p sl="en">The 6th Environment Action Programme is the first to be adopted in codecision, which not only reflects its legitimacy but also the importance given to the Environment Action Programmes over the past 40 years. In fact, these programmes have managed to provide an efficient framework for the protection and promotion of a healthy environment with a constant deepening and reinforcement of environmental policies. This is why we urge the European Commission to present the proposal for a 7th EAP in such a way as to ensure continuity of the EU environmental framework policy and avoid any gaps which might discredit our political will. I believe the persistence of the EAPs represents a major element with which to build a strong political message from the EU institutions, on the one hand, and a firm position on the protection of the environment, on which real progress has still to be achieved, on the other.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The current 6th Environment Action Programme, the first one to be adopted by codecision, having therefore increased its legitimacy and helping create a sense of involvement for subsequent policy proposals, will expire in July 2012. It has provided an overarching framework for environment policy, in which environmental legislation has been consolidated and substantially completed. The 7th Environment Action Programme should provide a comprehensive and coherent framework for strategic initiatives, setting priority objectives and showing clearly how environmental policy can contribute to green growth, improved health and increased welfare. The programme should ensure the adherence of all stakeholders – EU institutions, Member States, regional and local authorities, companies, private sector stakeholders, NGOs and the civil society – to a joint programme. I welcome in this regard the launching by the Commission, from March to 1 June 2012, of the public consultation to gather opinions on the EU’s 7th Environment Action Programme. This will set out the priority objectives to be pursued by 2020 in order to ensure better environmental protection and sustain our prosperity, while taking into account the limitations of the planet.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe undoubtedly faces challenges when it comes to education and employment in the future. It is worrying to learn that we are heading for a shortfall in highly-skilled workers needed to fill 35% of all jobs by 2020. It is right that we highlight these issues here. As ever, I support the sharing of ideas on education between Member States and the mobility of students across Europe. The Erasmus programme provides a wonderful opportunity for young people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Diversification between Member States is important, but institutions can work together to help each other engage with outside bodies such as business. These are the kinds of ideas that help to make students become confident, employable adults. However, this report’s endorsement of the Commission’s proposal for increasing the budget is unnecessary. We do not need to increase the budget to modernise our higher education systems. Education is vitally important. It is an important area and I take a strong interest in it within the European Parliament, but it remains a competence of the Member States and I abstained on this report because of the endorsement that it makes.</p>

In view of the growing difficulties being encountered by young people in the labour market and the fact that unemployment is increasingly affecting people with a higher education, I think that instituting reforms intended to adapt education programmes to the expectations of employers and allowing greater flexibility in the area of extending knowledge and skills are essential. Partnership between tertiary education, business and the public sector should become a basic norm. Two other matters which I think are very important are the rapporteur’s emphasis on the significance of education in the area of entrepreneurship and his call for mobility, exchange and research programmes to be opened to students from countries affiliated to the Eastern Partnership.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Tőkés report because I understand the importance of modernising Europe’s education systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Higher education plays a fundamental role in an individual’s personal growth, social integration and contribution to the economic and cultural influence of the European Union. Europe’s total investment in higher education is still too low. We all know about the current budgetary constraints but this is a key issue. We must use all the tools available to us to provide European universities with the necessary funding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has proposed an ambitious education budget for the next period. It will be able to count on Parliament’s full support. Structural Funds can and must also be mobilised for higher education. Between 2007 and 2013, more than EUR 70 billion from these funds will have been allocated to education and training. Lastly, some inexpensive initiatives can have considerable multiplying effects. In my region, a cross-border university research centre has been established, allowing for integrated training between France and Spain. Students therefore have two job markets and all the potential of two cultures available to them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report that I find comprehensive enough, but I am convinced that much remains to be done in the European Union to support the educational project, which is a vital project for both the economy and social cohesion. I believe, however, that the 2% Member State funding of the university system is not a sufficient guarantee for the educational project to improve in quality, and particularly to adapt to labour market requirements.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As regards this project, I welcome the fact that Erasmus traineeships were considered a useful experience for the European Union and I, too, believe they should carry on. I also believe we should consider the issues regarding the guarantees that must accompany individual educational projects and I think the recommendation addressed to Member States to ensure access to education is a useful one.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I abstained on this report on modernising Europe’s higher education system, which is, of course, vitally important. Whilst I accept that there are many serious challenges facing the higher education system today in Europe, in particular due to the current economic crisis, there were certain aspects of this report which worried me.</p>
      <p sl="en">With such a high level of youth unemployment across our Union, and with the increased demand for new skills resulting from the rapid technological changes that we have seen over recent years, it is clear – in some ways at least – that modernising the higher education system may help it face these problems. I would therefore support the idea of introducing lifelong learning programmes, for example, and increased European cooperation between educational institutions and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact remains, however, that education provisions should ultimately be a Member State responsibility. I could therefore not fully back this report, in view of its calls for increased public funding from Member States at a time of widespread austerity and cuts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the higher education system remains the responsibility of the Member States and in Germany of the federal states, but we need common principles and networks. The Tőkés report addresses important issues, including lifelong learning, studying at university alongside work, cultural diversity, protection for minorities, religious and ethical values and education on European issues. I very much welcome this. The university in your home town of Breslau, Mr President, sets an excellent example in this respect because it provides Polish, German and Silesian literature across national borders in several areas where different languages are spoken. This is the sort of European higher education policy that we want, not the Americanisation of our university system.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I supported the report by my colleague, Bishop László Tőkés, because, in the future, jobs will require ever higher levels of education. At present, just 26% of the European labour force have high-level qualifications. At the same time, we hear the results of studies that indicate that education will not necessarily guarantee a job today. There are more holders of a Master’s degree than before, and the number of those obtaining a doctorate is at an all-time record.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Employees have to update their skills and knowledge continuously, while they continue to work. This highlights the importance of lifelong learning. Universities and colleges should provide people with the skills and knowledge that they will need in the future labour market. The skills learned should also reflect the realities of the labour market. This means that we need to provide recent graduates with better opportunities for employment in the field for which their qualifications have prepared them.</p>

It is true that there are some sanctions which only affect the civilian population and these must be abolished as quickly as possible. We must also support positive developments. On the other hand, we must acknowledge that sanctions are not a bad thing in and of themselves. Burma would not have reached the position it is in today without certain sanctions and the awarding of the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament. We need to make one thing absolutely clear. This is not just about the civilian population. There are companies which have been trading in raw materials during the worst period of the dictatorship and this has undermined our policy in Burma. Therefore, we need a balance between the two things: economic common sense and cooperation, on the one hand, and a clear human rights policy, on the other.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I believe this is one of the most important resolutions adopted today because it concerns a practice which is becoming increasingly common, namely, that of the expropriation of shares or property owned by European Union companies in other third countries. Argentina’s intention to expropriate a European company is not likely to remain an isolated case, but to spread. Unfortunately, certain governments believe the answer to the crisis lies in the nationalisation or expropriation of property, which is fundamentally wrong and questions the capacity of the World Trade Organisation to act as a market regulator and guarantor of good economic practices.

It does accept, however, that there is still room for further improvement from the old central system coming straight from Brussels.</p>

I back calls for the Commission to continue all efforts to increase the transparency and accountability of the External Action Service, which should remain budget-neutral and subject to constant audit and scrutiny by this Parliament in the hope that this, in turn, will lead to it being more effective and better value for money for the Member States.</p>

For climate change is not just something that affects our environment and well-being: it has an especially acute impact on women in developing countries. In all areas of life, women make a considerable number of family consumption choices, everywhere in the world. There is discrimination against women in environmental, economic and family policy. That is surely why the position and role of women must be changed: they need to have far more influence.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is encouraging that research suggests that women are interested in making sustainable consumption decisions. This, however, is not enough.

They would amount to as much as 75% of the total number of environmental refugees, but women should not be perceived only as victims, but rather as potential contributors to the prevention of global warming through a more responsible behaviour and their central role in water management.

I agree that women are recipients of disaster-associated risks and water management issues, and I also agree that the impact on migration and health is stronger in their case, but I would have expected an answer to these challenges in a coherent policy.

Since we appear to actually have the time to occupy ourselves with such matters, I would, in any case, propose that we follow up this report with one on men and climate change, on gays and climate change, on redheads and left-handers and climate change, and why not, even on stamp collectors and climate change.

      <p sl="fi">On the other hand, women also play a crucial role in building sustainable consumption habits and lifestyles, in sustainable community planning, and in the fight against climate change. That is why, as it says in this report, it is especially important that women can be more deeply involved in policy making and, furthermore, in making choices with regard to climate policy.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report because it is necessary to enhance at once the efforts to protect biodiversity. Hence, a quarter of existing species might disappear within the next 30 years. I support Article 44 on further involvement by local actors. I also emphasise the importance of regional configurations for ensuring a coordinated approach. I should mention that the EU strategy for the Danube region includes in its scope of action the preservation of biodiversity, under the priority axis regarding environmental protection. I wish to point out the issue of illegal fishing and poaching. For example, over one hundred persons involved in such activities have been apprehended in the four months since the establishment of the coastguard service in Dobrogea. Therefore, I am in favour of the proposal contained in Article 86 for the establishment of a European coastguard service.</p>

A high level of protection is not only beneficial for the environment, but also from an economic perspective. In this context, I emphasise the importance of integrating environmental objectives into all other EU policies, with no exception. Although the 6th Environment Action Programme has consolidated legislation, its results are not entirely satisfactory.

ITER is the only scientific programme in the world on fusion energy, otherwise known as ‘star power’, with the involvement of the world’s leading experts on nuclear energy, and which may prove to be an energy solution in the future. It began in 1985 with a commitment to future energy between the Presidents of the US and the Soviet Union, Reagan and Gorbachev. The EU has been one of the main driving forces behind the programme from its outset. During the debate on the EU budget for 2012, the issue of underfunding was addressed, given the importance of the programme in question, and the Commission guaranteed that this matter would be resolved. I therefore welcome this report, which consolidates the Council’s position on this Draft amending budget, and I welcome the agreement that has been reached between the three European institutions, which has provided a solution to this problem.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the situation with regard to youth employment today is very poor in most European Union Member States, including Lithuania, and the situation will only get worse. Unemployment is affecting all groups of young people, regardless of their education and training. However, the risk of not finding a job is greater for young people with poor qualifications or without work experience. Moreover, many young people run the risk of becoming long-term unemployed. We therefore not only have to discuss what measures we will take in the future, but have to decide what to do now with young people who are currently unemployed and who are already threatened by long-term unemployment. It is very important to ensure that future generations of young people entering the labour market have high levels of education and training, which match current and future needs. This means cutting the number of school drop-outs and more young people completing vocational training. Barriers between the education system and the labour market should also be dismantled and the partnership between businesses and the education sector should be deepened. In the current crisis, when budgets are being cut, young people need effective and targeted investment, not fine words and promises. We have to invest in people, i.e. in education, vocational training, lifelong learning and jobs because only then will we be able to give young people opportunities to find a job that matches their education and qualifications.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Universities are, in essence, genuinely European institutions, as they were founded on the ‘old’ continent due to a fortunate symbiosis of tradition and innovation. Since the foundation of the first universities through to the present day, this establishment has evolved from a reserved and elitist institutional entity to a genuine centre of research and innovation, open to knowledge restructuring for the benefit of society. In the European system, universities are truly res publica , their ultimate purposes being linked to the collective interest of society as a whole. Currently, the supranational dimension of universities is becoming increasingly dominant, a trend undoubtedly due to the Sorbonne-Bologna Process, which started in 1998 in Paris, following the famous Sorbonne declaration. I would like to remind you that only 200 of Europe’s 4 000 higher education institutions rank among the top 500 in the world, and of these, few are located in Central and Eastern Europe. I believe it is necessary to improve the entire higher education system if we wish to maintain and even enhance Europe’s global competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="it">The dynamics of Europe’s labour market mean the demand for highly skilled workers is continually on the increase. If we do not take action on the supply side, by adapting the number of skilled workers to demand, this will lead not just to an inevitable slowdown of economic growth, but also to a wider pay gap between skilled and less skilled workers, and higher unemployment among the latter, who are already suffering the effects of strong competition from large incoming migration flows. In addition to the aforesaid economic reasons, strengthening higher education systems will have clear, positive effects on society. It is therefore in everyone’s interest to have a modern, effective education system, accessible to all, and which does not discriminate on the basis of social background. I therefore decided to vote in favour of the own-initiative report on modernising higher education systems which sets out, among other things, a series of suggestions seeking to reward excellence in teaching; to increase collaboration between education institutions and employers in order to improve the employability of students; to improve mobility by increasing funds for the Erasmus programme and to extend this programme to cover Master’s degrees; and lastly, to provide universal access to education through student loans guaranteed by the European Investment Bank.</p>

      <p sl="en">The modernisation of European education has been under discussion for at least the entire period of this parliament. I am concerned, however, that fundamental errors will be made which will reduce our higher education to the level of merely obtaining degrees. The rapporteur on higher education talks about highly qualified education, a term involving two completely different concepts which do not necessarily have a direct correlation. The growing number of graduates in the European population is an ever-increasing problem, with more than one third of people holding a university degree. At the same time, we have an ever-worsening shortage of traditional apprentices. It is essential for us to understand that having a large number of graduates for whom there is no work will not get Europe out of the crisis. I am in favour of closer links between secondary-level vocational schools and the business sector. On the one hand, we want to make it possible for all young people to study at university, but, on the other hand, we are then unable to offer them any suitable employment. The jobs on offer on the market are usually in the skilled trades category. We must therefore give some thought as to whether we are not doing something wrong here, and as to whether we are leading young people into a vicious circle of unemployment. We should instead be offering and encouraging both the traditional and the new skilled trades which our economy needs. Despite my reservations, the report is beneficial for this issue, and I will therefore vote for its adoption.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the context of a post-crisis Europe that is recovering and growing, higher education and training are of crucial importance. It is essential to give young Europeans the tools necessary for them to be able to compete in a globalised world and for them to be able to enter the labour market using their knowledge and skills. We cannot forget that youth unemployment figures are overwhelming throughout Europe. However, we should be aware that more training often does not correspond to more opportunities in the labour market. Cases of young graduates, with additional training and postgraduate training, but without a job and without prospects of finding one, are increasing in the EU. Training must be geared towards the needs of the market and must prepare young workers. In my view, this paradigm shift and the modernisation of the systems in order to bring them closer to the labour market will be vital in stopping the growth of unemployment among young people, and in ensuring that they have a future with more opportunities.</p>

The report on modernising Europe’s higher education systems, drafted by Mr Tőkés, is of great importance not only for countries that were once behind the Iron Curtain, but also for the rest of the Member States. For the former, it is important because it represents an opportunity to continue with democratic reforms, combat the crises of the past and move towards the modernisation of their education systems. For the latter, it is important because it provides support for overcoming the current crisis by boosting economic growth and promoting skilled employment among young people. The Bologna Process, which is divided into two cycles, has certainly entailed an increase in costs, and not everyone succeeds in completing their courses. Moreover, unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis has forced education budgets to be cut, particularly in Member States that are under a financial assistance programme. It is therefore vital to work with our social partners in order to ensure that those who are disadvantaged have access to learning. That is the only way in which we will be able to contribute to achieving the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As many warned, the Bologna Process and the so-called harmonisation of the higher education system have served the purpose of attacking the right to education and the social function of the Member States in this area, despite this being enshrined in the constitution of the Portuguese Republic. The consequences of this are visible in numerous countries today, including Portugal, which is seeing a dramatic rise in the cost of attending higher education, in particular – but not only – in what is now designated the ‘second cycle’ (postgraduate study). Higher education is clearly becoming the domain of the elite. There is now a distinction between those who are able and those who are unable to progress to higher education, but also between those who are able and those who are unable to attend the ‘second cycle’, which entails huge tuition fees. Numerous reports in the media have revealed that every day, thousands of students are abandoning higher education because they cannot afford it, and numbers are on the rise. The prime objective of the Bologna Process was simply to merchandise higher education. That is essentially why many called for its ‘modernisation’. The same goes for this report.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Although Europe has around 19 million students and more than 4 000 higher education institutions, currently, only 26% of the workforce has high-level qualifications. Responsibility for higher education rests mainly with Member States and higher education institutions themselves. Currently, they face several challenges. These include, for example, the issue of the number of graduates, widening access to higher education and adjusting curricula to meet labour market needs. This is also one of the options available to enable graduates to gain employment in a field for which their degree has prepared them. Monitoring graduates’ employment outcomes and improving the quality and availability of internationally comparative data on graduates may help higher education institutions to better fulfil their function. In the context of the current economic crisis, it is equally important that institutions of higher education continue to be well funded. It is good news that access to higher education for people from all social backgrounds is being improved. In connection with this fact, however, schools have to deal with rising numbers of students and a changing student base. They often also have to adapt their teaching methods to students with different needs. Taking into account the often difficult circumstances, I firmly believe that in trying to modernise higher education, it is necessary for Member States to take steps to stop it from falling behind higher education elsewhere in the world.</p>

The report is good because it rightly recognises that modernising higher education is a vital need under the changed circumstances of today. The report also rightly indicates that it is not just the educational methods, learning structures and training itself that are of key importance and in need of reform, but also the financial support of the system as a whole. The latter is an issue that cannot be treated separately and which fundamentally influences the quality of European education and training, and thereby supply on the European labour market. If we look at the issue of European higher education in the context of Europe 2020, then the view needs to prevail that we must create a system that does not place even greater burdens on those wishing to participate in higher education, but, at the same time, uses its resources rationally in response to real needs. Universities need even more financial support from the European Union in order to standardise their requirements, with attention to the appropriate mobility of students and the mutual recognition of degrees.</p>

This is precisely why it is necessary to take a series of steps which will allow us to use the potential of our universities. The Member States as well as the European Union should support these measures. The call for institutions of higher education to adapt to new challenges is important.

They should also take into account the development of science and technology by maintaining an appropriate balance between theoretical knowledge and practical skills.</p>

      <p sl="pl">This resolution is distinguished from many previous documents on higher education by the fact that it draws attention to the problem of the persistent disparities between the systems of higher education in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe. It gives me great satisfaction to welcome this part of the resolution. It is an extremely important aspect of the higher education system in today’s Europe. I fully support the resolution’s call to the European Commission to develop a strategy and draw up a professional financial action plan for reducing these disparities. I welcome the attention given to this matter, and this led me to endorse the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="et">I concur with the issues identified in the report on the modernising of Europe’s higher education systems and the challenges in the area of higher education in Europe. The foremost objective of institutions offering higher education is to prepare people to compete in the labour market. In order to fulfil this objective successfully, efforts must be made in three directions. Firstly, the real needs of the labour market, and the expectations it has of graduates of higher education institutions, must be regularly mapped to ensure that Europe’s higher education system does not ‘produce’ people whose education and skills do not match existing jobs. Along similar lines, institutions offering higher education should also monitor their graduates’ subsequent progress and career path. Based on the needs of the labour market and the career paths of present graduates, improvements can be made to existing curricula. Secondly, higher education institutions must be ready today to accept an altogether different group of people from those they accepted a few decades ago – the specialisations taught today and the instruction itself must be suitable for people with very different backgrounds with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, mother tongue, disability, prior work experience, etc. In addition, the nature of traditional professions and people’s attitudes have changed, and I therefore think that the third priority in the modernisation of higher education systems should be to make vocational guidance more effective. In addition to presenting different career paths, such guidance should encourage people to choose careers that are untypical for their gender (for instance, encouraging men to apply for work at institutions offering secondary education or encouraging women to seek careers in more technical fields).</p>

The percentage of highly-qualified workers currently falls short of the targets set for 2020, so all efforts in this regard are essential. It is crucial that higher education institutions remain well-funded, even with the current economic crisis.

Hence, the importance of higher education that is better adapted to developments in the labour market and the needs of employers. This is also the message being sent this afternoon by Parliament which, having adopted the Tőkés report by a very large majority, has highlighted the need for Member States to modernise their higher education systems. Only 200 of the 4 000 higher education institutions in Europe rank among the top 500 in the world. It is therefore now more crucial than ever to create the positive conditions required to unearth the talents of the future and stop the ‘brain drain’ if the European Union wants to remain globally competitive and successfully deal with the reality of the situation: 35% of all jobs in Europe will require highly skilled workers by 2020. Other initiatives in favour of young people in the EU should be put into practice with the target of investing 2% of each Member State’s GDP in education. I am referring, in particular, to real access to higher education for all social groups, facilitating loan systems for students and better recognition of qualifications obtained abroad.</p>

Indeed, I support the broad outlines of this text, which stresses the need to encourage student mobility and allow access to education for people from all social backgrounds as well as the importance of intensifying the interactions between the three sides of the knowledge triangle – education, research and innovation – as a key element for growth and job creation. In view of the coming budgetary constraints, the unemployment rates we are experiencing and the current demographic changes, higher education will have to undergo a huge transformation to meet the European target of around 35% of highly skilled workers for all jobs by 2020. This transformation will obviously impact on the question of practices, but also on questions regarding organisation, the development of ‘alternance’ (work-associated training), and resources. On this last point, however, I believe we should exercise caution when the report tackles the issue of the budget allocated to lifelong learning and training: I would like to remind you that these budgets must remain in line with the constraints currently being imposed on Member States’ public finances.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The report is well balanced, especially with regard to the combination ‘business’ and ‘higher level of education’, prudent about the wording of ‘knowledge alliances’ and ‘sector skills alliances’, specifying that the role of higher education institutions is to develop curricula to address skills shortages, incite business and entrepreneurs to develop partnerships by providing high-quality internships. It is interesting that there is insistence on a better governance system, including all stakeholders in universities and being transparent as to the different cooperation systems, ensuring independence of action and mission. Some recommendations are made in order to ensure a better gender balance, with flexible time arrangements. The target should be broader than just making people immediately ‘employable’ and the report reminds us that universities have a duty to provide general tuition with a humanistic dimension open to all at all times of life (insisting particularly on vocational training like ‘Leonardo da Vinci’, which is about to disappear in the Commission’s proposal for the new education programme ‘Erasmus for all’) and adding up a special Euro-Mediterranean dimension for mobility.</p>

At a time when public purse strings are being increasingly tightened, many higher education institutions across Europe are feeling the pinch. Education – and higher education in particular – is a crucial long-term investment if Europe is to reach the targets set by the 2020 strategy in the area of smart growth. Cuts in education should be avoided, where possible, as they will ultimately set us back further. The target of spending 2% of GDP on education should be maintained by all Member States. Taking into account the prevailing economic conditions, the loans facility proposed in the Erasmus for All programme for masters students wishing to study in another EU country is particularly welcome.

According to information from a survey conducted by the media in January, 32% of Lithuanian employers feel that people who have completed higher education lack the necessary skills for work. The funding of high-quality education is a problem in Lithuania. Although almost 10% of EU Structural Fund money provided for Lithuania is allocated to higher education, research and innovation, funding per student in Lithuania is among the lowest in the EU – funding per student in Lithuania is approximately half the EU average.

Adapting curricula solely to the needs of the labour market, strengthening cooperation with the ‘business world’, and researching ‘innovative alternative funding mechanisms’ (which are often private). This report goes as far as to welcome the Commission’s initiative to establish a European-level loan guarantee facility for Masters students within the new ‘Erasmus for All’ programme.

What, however, happened when the Bologna Process was applied in Portugal? What happened was nothing short of making higher education the domain of the elite; distinguishing between those able or unable to access higher education, but also between those able or unable to attend the ‘second cycle’, which entails huge tuition fees. There are countless cases and reports in Portugal today of students dropping out of higher education because they cannot afford it.

A competitive digital single market would facilitate the elimination of all remaining barriers to cross-border e-services, would contribute to employment and sustainable economic growth, particularly in the area of SMEs, and would facilitate the modernisation of public administration and reduce the cost of providing public services. The Information and communication technologies (ICT) sector is directly responsible for around 5% of European GDP, with a value of EUR 660 billion annually, but this sector’s potential has not been fully realised. Citizens still rarely use cross-border e-commerce because they do not feel safe due to the legislation in force in different countries, particularly in cases of compensation. There are also many administrative barriers to business, creating additional costs, such as different treatment and requirements for eInvoices in different Member States and difficulties due to differences in the regulation of signatures. I welcome the European eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015 presented by the Commission, whose successful implementation in the Member States would help modernise and reduce the costs of European and national public administrations.

The ICT sector makes a major contribution to maintaining the balance between the EU’s industrial policy, innovation, growth, competitiveness and trade. ICT’s contribution to overall productivity growth is huge. ICT can make a significant contribution to the EU 2020 strategy, particularly with regard to employment, sustainable economic and productivity growth, citizen empowerment, R&amp;D, energy, innovation and the environment, and to tackling major societal challenges. Cloud computing is an economic and ecological tool that improves the IT performance of public and private concerns, cuts processing costs and limits storage costs. However, there are no uniform rules on electronic invoicing and, for the most part, its benefits remain untapped.

The key element of the ‘eGovernment’ concept lies in improving the relationship and streamlining the information exchange between the public sector, on the one hand, and citizens and the business environment, on the other. eGovernment means providing public services to citizens and businesses electronically, which is a cheaper and more efficient alternative that would allow the government to get closer to the citizens and adapt its services to their needs.

I voted for this report and I hope that the measures advocated therein – such as eInvoicing, eSignature, mutual recognition, eProcurement and infrastructure renewal – will be rapidly implemented, so as to make life easier for companies, and to make public services more effective and user-friendly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report tackles the issue of the digital single market, which is intended to be ‘competitive’, ‘without barriers’ and ‘free of distortions of competition’. It also tackles the issue of implementing public administration online. To begin with, it must be stressed that mixing these two issues in the same report is not opportune; it was surely not done innocently. We believe that scientific and technological advances, such as new online technologies, can open up possibilities for society and civilisation to make progress. Introducing these services in public administrations could help make them more efficient, and improve public and staff convenience and well-being. It could also pave the way for diversifying, improving and expanding public services themselves. However, we cannot forget that the current situation is marked by a variety of attacks on public service and the social functions of the state. In this context, introducing new technologies has, at times, been used as a pretext for cutting costs and functions, without any resulting improvements for the public or public servants; quite the contrary.</p>

      <p sl="sk">One of the seven flagship initiatives of Europe’s growth strategy is the Digital Agenda for Europe, a strategy for taking advantage of the potential offered by the rapid progress of digital technologies. Member States use different models for eGovernment applications using electronic signatures, and most of the EU countries have adopted e-signatures in their eGovernment applications without taking into account e-signatures created by companies and individuals in other countries. The regulatory, technical and organisational framework is always organised from a strictly national perspective. This means, in practice, that non-nationals must physically register in the country where the application is deployed. Only a few national eGovernment applications are open to them. The main obstacle to the cross-border use of e-signatures lies in the lack of trust in e-signatures originating from another state and in difficulties in validating these signatures. However, I firmly believe that when deciding on the level of security for signatures in eGovernment applications, Member States should also consider cross-border cooperation and, where possible, remove obstacles to cross-border services. I believe that efforts to adopt the best combination of new technologies and open specification and innovative architectures would also clearly be to the benefit of all stakeholders – citizens and businesses – and would enhance their rights.</p>

Electronic communication between citizens and public administration, that is, eGovernment services, is gaining ground across Europe. I can proudly report, for example, that the www.magyarorszag.hu portal puts my country well on the way to achieving electronic public administration across the board. However, we must not forget that we can only create digital confidence if we also guarantee personality rights, tackle security risks and invest in human knowledge and the provision of access. To that end, it is vital to provide the framework for the digital operation of enterprises, since running into problems daily can destroy the entrepreneurial spirit. In my view, today, it is the Internet that represents the best opportunity for small enterprises, which is why I wish, by voting in favour, to create the right conditions for our enterprises in what they do best: business. Of course, there is still a long way to go to achieve our common goal. A great deal more work is still needed for the favourable conditions to be created at a European level that will allow everyone in our joint European family to enjoy the results achieved through cooperation on the part of the Member States.</p>

These days, the electronic environment plays an increasingly more important role in everyday processes. By developing it, we should also be able to improve the labour productivity of individuals and businesses. That is why it is essential that as many people as possible should have access to eGovernment services, and that services such as eSignature and eInvoicing should be developed as rapidly as possible. At the same time, however, we must ensure that people who, for example, have limited access to the Internet or no access at all, are not disadvantaged as a result.

Although 70% of public authorities have started working with eProcurement, its mere 5% level of take-up does not yet allow for major benefits. Its wider application could produce cost savings of up to 30%.

The use of the Internet as applied to institutions and administrations gives rise to an ever-evolving democratic situation, which nonetheless requires constant updating. Therefore, eGovernment is a driving force not only for the democracy factor that we are all committed to including in our daily activities, but also for the digital market. Businesses operating in the European market, including those functioning in a cross-border environment, have the need to streamline relations with public bodies in order to speed up their production processes.

In view of this, steps have already been taken to make public services available to citizens. The next objective should be to coordinate the validation of opportunities for identification on the Internet – in other words, private individuals and legal entities are indeed now able to identify themselves and sign documents on the Internet, but other European Union Member States may not recognise this.

Terrorism in the Sahel is fought actively by implementing the policies of development, social justice, the rule of law and integration. However, during the night of 21-22 March 2012, the President of Mali, Amadou Toumani Touré, was overthrown in a coup, which put an end to a long democratic process, which had begun more than two decades previously. The proliferation of arms emanating from Libya, drug trafficking, high unemployment and poverty are contributing to the destabilisation of the region as a whole. The country is also dealing with renewed fighting in the north between government forces and rebels, which has displaced more than 200 000 people since January. Others have fled to neighbouring countries where the severe drought has already caused significant food shortages in recent years. Even worse, child soldiers are being recruited to fight. The Sahel is thus facing its worst humanitarian crisis in the past 20 years. There are reports of serious violations of the human rights against the population of Mali, especially in rebel-held northern areas. Food shortages are affecting millions of people – approximately 175 000 children are suffering from serious malnutrition.

The humanitarian situation is very complicated and the intervention of non-governmental organisations to provide food and medical aid is urgently required. Having been perceived since it was founded as a staunch defender of human rights as defined by the United Nations, the European Union has adopted a strong leadership role in this process and secured an agreement for a return to order – which is no mean feat – by supporting the appointment of an interim government until elections are held.

This coup d’état is compounded by other highly unstable situations in the Sahel region and West Africa, which are rich in natural resources, particularly energy, and are therefore coveted by many. It is important to seek a peaceful, political, negotiated solution to this conflict that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Mali.

      <p sl="sk">The situation in northern Mali threatens the stability of the whole of the African sub-region. The Sahel arc is a pivotal area between sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, with major importance for the security of both parties. The European Union has an interest in bringing stability and security to the region and a desire to do so. At present, however, the situation in this area is critical. There are links to traffickers in drugs, arms and even human beings, who are often in captivity with a ransom being required for their release. Terrorist groups exploit the adverse living conditions, social deprivation and uncertain job prospects, recruiting mainly young men into their ranks under the pretext of earning a wage. In order to combat separatist militant groups, terrorism and various forms of human trafficking, cooperation between all countries of the Sahel and Sahara region plays an important role. Efforts to prevent terrorism, human trafficking and human rights violations are also in the direct interest of the European Union and its Member States. I firmly believe that it is necessary to mobilise all available resources in order to protect and promote security and development in this African region.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Parliament has made known its deep concern with regard to the political situation in Mali, shaken by the Tuareg rebellion and the military coup on 21 March. The ECOWAS intervention and the designation of President Compaoré as mediator have allowed constitutional order to be restored in the country, and I am very pleased about that. On 6 April, a framework agreement to emerge from the crisis was signed and allowed ECOWAS to lift its sanctions from 10 April. Investment from Europe, and from France in particular, is strong in this country, with which we have always maintained close relations. Indeed, the European Union is investing EUR 560 million in Mali to accompany its development efforts, EUR 50 million within the framework of the strategy for development and security in the Sahel and EUR 9 million to fund assistance for refugees and displaced persons in northern Mali. However, the situation has not been fully resolved and we must remain vigilant with regard to the risk of the humanitarian and food situation deteriorating, which could lead to a serious crisis in a region that has already been weakened by the threat of terrorism and organised crime.</p>

Signs of an escalation include the wave of political arrests and the conflict between government troops and rebels which has flared up once again. In addition, several extremist groups have gained a hold in Mali. Humanitarian aid is important, but I believe that in the current circumstances, it will not reach the civilian population which is in need of it. There is a risk that the aid will be misused by the rebels and others. First of all, we need to coordinate the activities of all the aid organisations more effectively, so that they are not working at cross-purposes.

This coup, which has been strongly condemned by the international community, threatens the stability of Mali but also that of the whole Sahel region. Through considerable mediation efforts, a framework agreement has been signed between the military junta and ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States). The subregional organisation will, from now on, play a major role in the negotiations. This is proof of the effectiveness of the African Peace Facility, a European fund that finances training for subregional brigades in crisis management. I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the situation in Mali because this is a balanced and fair text.

However, the situation has now changed, with the secessionist threat in the North, the coup, kidnappings, fundamentalist groups imposing strict Sharia law and the risk of famine. Each one of these problems is a human drama which is difficult to solve. Each of these problems can have a contagious effect in the region. Mali is a collateral victim of the conflict in Libya. It finds itself in a situation that is larger than itself, the real reasons for which have their roots outside its borders. If one considers the confirmed links that terrorist groups in the Sahel-Sahara region have with criminals trafficking drugs, weapons, cigarettes and human beings, and particularly with the taking of hostages for ransom, and if one takes note of the news informing us of the serious human rights violations perpetrated against the people of Mali, my vote can only be in favour. I welcome the signing of the framework agreement, which provides for a series of steps to restore constitutional order. I am of the opinion that state institutions should be strengthened, that the active participation of citizens in decision-making processes should be promoted, and that the necessary groundwork for sustainable and equitable economic development should be established.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The coup d’état that took place in Mali was loudly condemned by the European Union. On 22 March 2012, military officials announced that they had kidnapped the President, in order for government authorities to support the army by strengthening arms to defend the north of the country against Tuareg occupation. They thus declared the abrogation of the constitution and the dissolution of all state institutions. This event in the West African region is exacerbating existing problems and creating a humanitarian crisis at the borders, due to the increased number of displaced persons and refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries such as Mauritania, Algeria and Burkina Faso. The EU should coordinate its activities with the interim authorities, once an understanding is reached for an interim government to prepare the country for the forthcoming elections. Political declarations must be combined with concrete actions, together with the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the Economic Community of West African States and the UN. The EU’s role will be essential in initiating a future peace proposal and in restoring stability and the democratic process.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As we warned at the time, the attacks against Libya would have extremely serious consequences, not only for its people – who are facing social regression, instability and conflict – but also for the entire region. Weapons and military equipment arrived in northern Mali following the military intervention of France, Great Britain, the United States and NATO in Libya, further igniting the tense internal situation. This coup d’état is compounded by other highly unstable situations in the Sahel region and West Africa, which are immensely rich in natural resources, particularly energy, thus stirring the interest and neo-colonial intentions of European powers, the United States and NATO. As opposed to contributing towards a peaceful solution, most of Parliament are in favour of interference and support a European military intervention under the European Security and Defence Policy. If this materialises, it will only heighten instability and the risk of further conflict, as previous interventions of this type have demonstrated, particularly in Africa. What is needed is unconditional support for a peaceful political solution to the conflict in Mali, without outside interference, so as to safeguard the sovereignty of Malians and the territorial integrity of the country.</p>

Hundreds of political prisoners are still in prison and many of those who are no longer detained have only been released conditionally There is a need for caution in addressing the situation of this country. The government is addressing the legacy of decades of civil war and armed unrest, resulting in a series of ceasefire arrangements with the majority of armed ethnic groups, while humanitarian aid to tens of thousands of displaced citizens is blocked and the policy of discrimination against the Rohingya minority continues unabated. In my view, it is important to support the government, which has indicated that it is pursuing a three-step process of peace building: firstly, a ceasefire, secondly, socio-economic, cultural and political processes and, finally, an all-encompassing agreement – involving changes to the constitution. Taking all this into account, it seems particularly important that the EU and international society demand that the government of Burma/Myanmar also initiates legal reforms in order to ensure a truly independent and impartial judiciary, and to establish a process of justice and accountability for past human rights abuses.</p>

A political process has begun that has given rise to a series of radical changes: the satisfactory outcome of the by-elections held on 1 April; the release of a significant number of political prisoners; the adoption of a series of legislative and governmental measures aimed at increasing openness, from the initiation of economic reforms to the easing of press and Internet censorship and the promulgation of laws on freedom of association and the freedom to strike; and the initiation of a process of dialogue with the main ethnic groups. While recognising the still undeveloped context in which this process of opening and national reconciliation is taking place, the transition from a military to a civilian government and the democratic opposition’s possibility to be represented are basic aspects.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution because the changes taking place in Burma offer important opportunities for developing a much improved relationship between the European Union and Burma/Myanmar. On 1 April 2012, Burma held by-elections for over 40 seats in its lower house of parliament (Pyithu Hluttaw), and these by-elections, which were broadly deemed to be free and fair by the international community, are an indication that Burma/Myanmar is on the path to democratic change. The invitation and presence of foreign observers and journalists, including a European Parliament representative, at the elections is proof of the willingness of the government of Burma/Myanmar to continue its process of reforms, which should be sustainable and irreversible. During its first year in office, the government of President Thein Sein has made more progress towards democracy than was made in the last few decades. The government is at last taking note of people’s concerns regarding projects that may be environmentally and socially disruptive and has taken steps to expand civil liberties in the country, with greater freedom of information and expression. The changes taking place in Burma are therefore welcomed by the European Union’s Member States. However, there is a gap between the political decisions at the highest level and the limited institutional and technical capacities on the ground. Changes are slow to impact on the lives of the majority of Burmese citizens, who continue to face great poverty, high levels of debt, a lack of employment and an absence of social services.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the last months, Burma has made more progress towards democracy and peace than was made in the last decades. The by-elections of 1 April 2012, which were broadly deemed as free and fair by the international community, are, above all, an indication that Burma is on the path to democratic change. This change creates important opportunities for establishing a much improved relationship between the European Union and Burma. Nonetheless, the next legislative elections, which should take place in 2015, will be the real test of the Burmese authorities’ will to democratise the country. In the meantime, there is a need for caution, all the more so because the report by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma highlights serious human rights concerns – hundreds of political prisoners are still in prison to this day. This resolution on the situation in Burma seems balanced in my view. It recognises the recent efforts made by the country while reflecting my concerns, particularly with regard to the situation of Burmese political prisoners. I therefore voted in favour of it.</p>

After 50 long years of military rule, the Burmese authorities are showing signs of openness to free and democratic elections, as well as mutual rapprochement with the election of Aung San Suu Kyi and activists belonging to her party. In addition to these developments, I would also like to stress the gradual release of political prisoners and the importance that President Thein Sein intends to place on ending ethnic wars in the country. However, more steps need to be taken, including the need to amend the Burmese constitution so as to remove the military’s role in civilian politics. The EU must now invest its full support in this transitional process, including creating senior management positions in several areas, and supporting education and sectors of the economy. I therefore believe it is important for the EU to review certain sanctions imposed on the country, as a way of initiating a constructive dialogue.</p>

Indeed, the elections of 1 April marked the victory of the historic opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s party. Deemed free and fair by the international community, the election consolidates the reforms undertaken over a year ago by the Burmese Government (the release of political prisoners, demobilisation of ex-combatants, actions in favour of freedom of expression). In this text, we wanted to take stock of the unique opportunity that has presented itself in order to develop a privileged relationship with Burma.

Big business and the major powers, which the majority in the European Parliament serve, demand a change in the approach to this country for their own pragmatic reasons. Myanmar’s geostrategic location between China and India, and its natural resources, especially energy resources, could play an important role for the EU and its NATO allies, particularly the United States. It is clear that the concerns of the majority in the European Parliament have little to do with the people of this country. The resolution makes no mention of the fact that this is one of the poorest countries in the world. Many years of conflict between different ethnic groups and the central government – the legacy of a colonial presence that always exploited ethnic differences – continue to drive the overwhelming majority of its population into greater poverty and misery.

This decision is all the more justified, as experience shows that privatisations do not resolve sovereign debt problems, but lead to reduced income, employment and tax receipts; to increased social security costs, because there are always redundancies following privatisations; and to weaker democratic public control over key sectors of the economy. As such, they undermine democracy itself. This resolution demonstrates, once again, that the majority in this Parliament are not here to defend the sovereignty of the peoples, or the rights, interests and needs of the workers and general public by protecting their access to energy and other natural resources.

The financial instability and uncertainty in recent months have led to a decline in its market value, and a similar situation has also affected some other European companies. I believe that the Argentine government’s decision to expropriate the majority of shares may call into question the principle of legal security in that country and will adversely affect the climate for European investment. There have traditionally been good partnership relations between the European Union and Argentina, which share common values, principles and interests, and I firmly believe that it would be right to resume the path of dialogue and negotiation as the most suitable means of resolving possible differences.

Parliament’s resolution attacks the decision of a sovereign state with the sole motivation of protecting European investments. It is entirely legitimate for a sovereign state to proceed with the nationalisation of companies that do not respect their commitments in terms of economic development and respect for human rights and that prioritise the interests of their shareholders to the detriment of national workers. Argentina has made a political choice in favour of Argentineans and the country’s public interest. It is therefore not political interference in the free market. Calling for sanctions is ridiculous.

The opposite has been happening in Portugal, where the governments of the Socialist Party (PS) and Social Democratic Party (PSD) have been paving the way for, and realising the surrender of, the Portuguese people’s public and collective resources.

However, we would distance ourselves from some aspects of the report – for example, the comments on the European External Action Service – and there are some omissions that we consider important. As we stated during the debate, the country, and its authorities, institutions and civil society organisations need to be closely involved in making and implementing policy if they are really to take ownership of development aid. The European Union must support and not direct. It must build capacities and not impose.

This functional mechanism would provide all relevant information on where agencies are planning to spend their budgets, therefore making aid more targeted and allowing resource gaps and funding opportunities in individual countries to be identified. At the same time, the growing support for official development aid as a means of eradicating poverty and achieving the set development goals is good news. In this regard, I believe it is appropriate to showcase how the impact of aid is improving the lives of poor people, because such a move would greatly help to refute scepticism about the effectiveness of aid.</p>

However, the Commission must make further efforts to improve the manner in which it evaluates the quality and the results of its interventions and especially to further improve its links with each of its delegations.

The social and economic development of marginal countries will only really occur and be sustainable when they cease to be dependent on powers such as the EU, are able to take advantage of and strengthen their domestic capacity, and are not seeing their resources continuously depleted. We would also stress that EU external development aid should never, under any circumstances, be used to pursue a so-called defence agenda, with EU military and interventionist intentions.

In some regions, almost 70% of all employed women work in agriculture and produce up to 90% of some crops, yet they are virtually absent from budget deliberations and climate change activities. Furthermore, droughts and water shortages resulting from climate change force women to work more in order to provide water, food and energy, while young people frequently abandon school to help their mothers in these tasks. It should be recognised that climate change exacerbates gender discrimination in addition to its other catastrophic effects. Averting dangerous climate change must therefore be the highest priority of the European Union, both in domestic and external policy. Unfortunately, at present, there is still a lack of data and statistics produced according to gender, which could be used to carry out research in the areas of transport, energy and agricultural policy. More information in the area of climate change would help provide a better understanding and evaluation of the gender aspect in this area.

The inclusion of gender issues provides an opportunity to make the fight against climate change stronger, fairer and more effective. I firmly believe that it is important to base our approach equally on two principles – addressing the effects of inequality and tackling its causes, principally by increasing women’s financial independence and their means of emancipation. Although, at European Union level, the links between gender and development policy are well established, the link between gender and mitigation policy has been neither explored nor used.

In order to obtain a better overview of the situation, we should first gather statistics on the influence of climate measures on women, and also on whether men or women are the decision makers in policy areas connected with the environment. Environmental problems and the measures adopted to combat them are of global importance and influence everyone, which makes it extremely important that one gender should not be under-represented in delegations of negotiators and decision makers. The report ‘Women and Climate Change’ emphasises those very problems, and for that reason, I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The impacts of climate change affect women more than men as they are in a more vulnerable situation. Climate change fosters this discrimination. However, the green economy, which is still in its infancy, is a source of hope. There is still time to fully integrate women into this green economy. I support this report as it presents the need to increase training for women. I firmly believe that access to education and greater training for women is an essential prerequisite to reducing their vulnerability. It was therefore an opportune moment for Parliament to send a message to the Commission, the Council and the Member States and to urge them to take measures in this area. I therefore voted in favour of this report as it encourages the Member States and institutions to continue to support projects in developing countries. This resolution also recommends that the Commission put in place indicators to evaluate the impact of the projects we are supporting and to raise awareness of the impact of climate change on the situation of women.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour!!! Climate change and its impacts are by no means gender neutral. Due to gendered roles, women’s impact on the environment is not the same as men’s, and their access to resources and ways to cope and adapt is severely affected by discrimination in terms of income, access to resources, political power, education and household responsibility. We therefore need to take women into account at every stage of our climate policies, and in the following aspects: adaptation policies, mitigation policies, financing of these policies and political representation of women. The proportion of women in climate change negotiations is still unsatisfactory, women account for only 12-15% of heads of delegation and around 30% of the delegates. Links between gender and climate, although they appear clearly in developing countries, also exist within the EU, e.g. in energy, transport and agricultural sectors. The future green economy relies on overwhelmingly male-dominated industries, which affects equal opportunities in occupation, education and training and encourages ‘male-only’ business cultures incompatible with the implementation of gender equality.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on women and climate change. Research shows that climate change is not gender neutral and that it affects women and men in different ways. This is confirmed by the International Panel on Climate Change in its 4th assessment report of 2007. Women make up 85% of people who die as a result of climate change and 75% of environmental refugees. The level of fatalities caused by natural disasters is higher among women – over 70% of the victims of the tsunami in 2004 were women.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Research on climate change should therefore give greater attention to the issue of gender. I would like to draw attention to the situation of women in developing countries, who are bearing the brunt of climate change – ubiquitous gender inequalities mean women and girls are disproportionately more at risk from its consequences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The traditional division of roles and discrimination against women reduce their ability to adapt the way they live to changes in climate. The effects of climate change will lead to long-term consequences for gender equality. They exacerbate inequalities in access to wealth, land, new technologies, education and information – factors which play an essential role in the fight against climate change.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has itself confirmed that the impact of climate change varies according to gender, age and class, with the poor likely to suffer the most. We welcome the recommendation that all policies have an integrated gender dimension at all stages, and that all areas have gender-equality and gender-justice objectives, in order to ensure that climate action does not increase gender inequality.

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this report as I acknowledge that infrastructure-building, urbanisation, industrialisation and physical intervention in the landscape in general are amongst the most significant drivers of the fragmentation of ecosystems and habitats. In the context of their planning regulations and implementation measures, and within the framework of their competences, local, regional and national governments must take these factors that sometimes pose a threat to ecosystems and habitats into account in their large- and small-scale planning and development projects. The pressures and the requirement at local and regional level to provide substantial economic development are understandable. I therefore consider it very important that local and regional authorities be mindful of striking a balance between development, and the need to protect biodiversity and natural habitats. For example, the Azores islands are at the forefront of protecting biodiversity, seeking to implement energy plans, tourism activities, etc. that enhance and protect their biodiversity. As such, regional and local development policies must deliver biodiversity benefits and halt further loss of habitats.</p>

In 2010, the European Union failed to achieve its objective of halting the loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity loss is currently reducing global GDP by 3% each year. Nearly 65% of the habitat types and 52% of the species listed in the Annexes to the Habitats Directive have an unfavourable conservation status. Furthermore, habitats and species are threatened by climate change. Even worse, the EU’s borders have already been breached by more than 11 000 alien species, at least 15% of which are invasive and detrimental to biodiversity. Measures therefore need to be taken to secure nature and ecosystem services for future generations, to this end giving higher political priority to biodiversity. The European Union’s 2020 headline target for biodiversity and global biodiversity commitments also needs to be met. It is also important for sufficient funding to be made available in the next multiannual financial framework and for the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services to be integrated into the economy.

I believe we need better cooperation at European level with regard to the diversity of animal and plant genetic resources in order to preserve them and improve their capacity to adapt to climate change. At the same time, European citizens’ initiatives for the protection of biodiversity and their commitment to biodiversity and eco-volunteering through civic service must be supported by the Member States and the European Commission in order to identify patterns and best practices that can then be applied at European level, as well as the need to conduct information and awareness campaigns on biodiversity, intended for all ages and social categories.</p>

The continued and growing pressures on Europe’s biodiversity, such as land-use change, over-exploitation of biodiversity and its components, the spread of invasive alien species, pollution and climate change, have either remained constant or are increasing and, at the same time, indirect drivers, such as population growth, limited awareness about biodiversity and the fact that the economic value of biodiversity is not reflected in decision making are also taking a heavy toll on this situation.

Urgent action is needed, and the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 looks at the necessary measures to secure nature and ecosystem services for future generations. Biodiversity should be included in all EU policies. Our support is necessary for the achievement of the targets in the next multiannual financial framework and for the phasing out of harmful subsidies. As major European policies are currently under review, the timing is right. I voted in favour, since this report is really useful.</p>

I thank my colleagues for supporting my amendment to protect the beekeeping sector. Now that we are discussing the new common agricultural policy (CAP), we must give beekeepers a positive sign and assure them that their efforts are not in vain and do not go unnoticed. As mentioned in the European Parliament report on honeybee health and the challenges of the beekeeping sector, this sector is of great importance to biodiversity conservation. Eighty-four per cent of plant species and 76% of food production in Europe depend on honeybee pollination. Bulgaria is one of the richest countries in Europe in terms of biodiversity. At the same time, beekeeping in Bulgaria, just as in other European countries, is facing the problem of bee colony loss – a fact that threatens biodiversity in Europe. This is why we need to give the sector a chance, because, unlike the European Commission’s environmental measures that are being discussed, which we are to impose on farmers for a greener CAP, the only thing that we need to do for beekeepers is to help them simply do their job.</p>

We have a habit of pointing our fingers at developing countries, but this time we should look in the mirror. Neither is it a solution for us to move the worst-polluting factories of European industry to developing countries and then report that the situation is improving. Planet Earth is the common home of all humans, and the activities of every people and every country influence and affect us all, regardless of geographical location. There are direct and mutual connections between biological diversity and climate change, and we must approach the solution of such questions on a global level. In order to ensure that the European Union’s objectives on protecting biological diversity are achieved, different spheres of life must increasingly be involved, and increasing importance must be assigned to the evaluation of environmental impact. European agricultural policy certainly has one of the most important roles to play in implementing these objectives, and so I am glad to see that this has been taken into consideration in the next reform of the common agricultural policy.

During the International Year on Biodiversity (2010), we heard the most beautiful declarations from political leaders all over the world on the huge importance of biodiversity; about the crucial role it plays for mankind. But as they were speaking, the EU’s strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity in 2010 failed completely. As they were speaking, species were being lost 100 to 1 000 times faster than the natural rate. As they were speaking, they failed in all attempts to agree on measures to fight against climate change. Somehow, the warm words on the importance of biodiversity have not translated into strong policy measures. But the statistics speak for themselves. 60% of the world’s ecosystems are degraded or used unsustainably (FAO, 2010); 90% of our fish stocks are over-exploited; and 25% of all European species are threatened with extinction. According to the UN study, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB, 2010), we lose 3% of worldwide GDP each year due to biodiversity loss. The costs of inaction are many times higher than the investments needed now. The need for urgent measures seems to be clear.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The rapporteur rightly observed that the European Union was unable to achieve the biodiversity target set in 2010; greater political attention should be paid to damaged ecosystems. At 32%, the level of biodiversity in Lithuania is significantly higher than in other EU countries. Lithuania is covered by more than 20 000 forests and there are 1 800 plant species. However, according to research by the Lithuanian Fund for Nature, agriculture and tourism has recently had a very negative impact on biodiversity in Lithuania. Coastal and forest ecosystems are in greatest danger. I am pleased that the rapporteur has mentioned biodiversity as an important economic factor. A study recently carried out has shown that biodiversity loss may have huge economic consequences on the Baltic Sea region. In order to protect our biodiversity, Lithuania must raise public awareness and regulate agriculture more strictly. Lithuania should also increase efforts to create special protected territories (such as reserves protected by the state, other reserves and heritage sites) and environmental protection areas. Currently, the system for safeguarding protected areas only covers 15.3% of Lithuania’s territory, which is not enough.</p>

      <p sl="pt">A healthy environment and a high level of environmental protection are prerequisites for guaranteeing quality of life and preserving the stability of ecosystems. Environmental action programmes have guided the development of EU environment policy since the early 1970s. They have been a powerful driver for the adoption of strong EU environmental legislation, notably in areas such as air, water, waste and the climate. Protection of our environment increases quality of life, notably by safeguarding ecosystems and their services, by halting the loss of biodiversity, by ensuring better air quality and less noise, by creating jobs and growth, and by ensuring well-being for current and future generations. However, the state of the environment is far from satisfactory and we should immediately begin the 7th Environment Action Programme.</p>

      <p sl="en">A healthy environment and a high level of environmental protection are prerequisites for guaranteeing quality of life as well as preserving the stability of the ecosystems. Environmental action programmes have guided the development of EU environment policy and they should continue to do so through the 7th Environment Action Programme, which will provide for an overarching framework that makes it possible to deal with both persistent and emerging environmental and sustainability challenges. I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I agree with the rapporteur’s comment that the 7th Environment Action Programme should give a strong overarching framework that would ensure coherence. It should ensure that all existing environment-related 2020 targets for the various policy areas are included and examined in conjunction with each other, and should provide for a clear ambitious vision for 2050, in order to give a long-term perspective for all stakeholders. I voted for this report for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Our environment is once again under threat. I am particularly concerned about our unsustainable consumption. To get us moving, to shed light on the issue for us, the carbon footprint of our everyday actions is still too large. Improving the energy efficiency of the products we use every day must therefore be encouraged. At the same time, reserves of fossil fuels are dwindling and we are increasingly dependent on the countries that supply us. The next EU environment strategy focuses on reducing our dependence on oil and gas by promoting the development of renewable energies. This 7th Environment Action Programme, which has been put to the vote, also calls on Member States to better implement the existing body of legislation on water. This is a strong signal to improve water quality in Europe. Lastly, this review of the existing programme considers the green economy to be an excellent source of jobs and growth, which will enable us to achieve our objectives for intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe for 2020. It is for all of these reasons that I voted in favour of this new strategy for the environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. We did not table many amendments as the rapporteur had already produced a very good draft. Most of our amendments were adopted or integrated into compromises. We highlighted the fact that key decisions with a strong impact on the environment are likely to be taken prior to the adoption of the 7EAP (MFF, CAP, CFP, Horizon 2020), and that environment protection needs to be fully integrated. We called for full implementation of EU environment legislation also in times of austerity. We also raised issues with regard to sustainable use of land, more action on biodiversity protection, sustainable chemicals policy and action on endocrine disruptors. Several of our amendments that tried to strengthen the link to effects on health were not successful.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this document because I believe that a high level of environmental protection is a prerequisite for guaranteeing the quality of life and preserving the stability of ecosystems. The protection of our environment enhances quality of life by halting the loss of biodiversity and ensuring better water quality and less noise pollution. Such protection also contributes to job creation and growth, and ensures the well-being of present and future generations.

      <p sl="it">The 6th Environment Action Programme has almost come to an end after a 10-year programme that has led to the achievement of a number of environmental policy targets on a global level.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe continues to want to be at the forefront by taking upon itself unilateral commitments without demanding, as it should, a global effort. A 7th Environment Action Programme has become necessary to achieve targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy. Among these are the strengthening of environmental legislation and the recognition of an international dimension to environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="it">The protection of our environment enhances quality of life, especially since it preserves ecosystems and their services, halts the loss of biodiversity, ensures better water quality and less noise pollution, creates jobs and growth and ensures the well-being of present and future generations.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am against the text of the report because the prospect of achieving these objectives will prove to be counterproductive, since they will be difficult to achieve except at a disproportionate and hardly sustainable cost, which will be borne entirely by European citizens. Environmental protection, the protection of biodiversity and the fight against climate change need to be undertaken on a global level.</p>

      <p sl="it">Environmental degradation caused by air pollution, noise, chemicals, poor water quality and ecosystem degradation is an important factor in the increase of chronic diseases. Given the current sustainability challenges that the EU has to tackle, the environment action programmes, as global instruments, help to ensure the necessary coordination between different EU policies. Over the next 10 years, it will be even more important to address environmental issues through a more coherent and integrated approach that takes into account the links between different issues and bridges the gaps that still exist; otherwise, irreversible damage could be caused. Therefore, this vote serves to emphasise how the 7th Environment Action Programme will provide the clarity and predictability needed by national and local governments, citizens, entrepreneurs and investors regarding the European Union’s environmental choices. It will then be necessary to enforce and strengthen environmental legislation, integrate environmental objectives into all policy areas and create an international dimension to environmental protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The environmental action programmes are intended to set out the EU’s environment policy. They play a central role in guiding legislation in the environmental areas of air, water, waste and climate. The 6th Environment Action Programme (6EAP) expires on 22 July 2012, and there is a need to conduct an exhaustive evaluation and to set the strategic priorities for the next programme. I am voting for this report, which gives a positive evaluation of the 6EAP, but also takes the view that many of the enshrined objectives were not achieved and, accordingly, must continue to be a priority in the next programme. I believe that the 7th Environment Action Programme should establish a strict environmental policy that is in close alignment with the economic development of the Member States. It should establish concrete objectives for 2020 and set out an ambitious long-term vision for achieving a sustainable future and better quality of life for the European public. I voted for this report because I think the European Union’s international role needs to be reinforced in the areas of climate change, efficient and sustainable resource use, biodiversity, forestry and environmental quality.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the report on the review of the 6th Environment Action Programme and the setting of priorities for the 7th Environment Action Programme – A better environment for a better life. A healthy environment and a high level of environmental protection are prerequisites for guaranteeing the quality of life as well as preserving the stability of ecosystems. I emphasise the importance of involving citizens in environmental policies and informing them thereupon in order for these to be successful. I call for increased efforts in this regard in the next action programme, taking into account that a better environment for a better life cannot be achieved unilaterally by the institutions, without the support of society as a whole. I believe the 7th Environment Action Programme should reflect mandatory targets with regard to energy efficiency and/or energy savings, as these will help fight global warming and protect the environment. We urge the Member States to fully implement water legislation so as to ensure compliance with the Water Framework Directive and the directive on the assessment and management of flood risks. We call on Member States to take measures for the recovery of natural river banks and the reforestation of neighbouring areas.</p>

      <p sl="en">Establishing priorities for the upcoming years at EU level has wide-ranging effects, not only with regard to the 27 Member States, but also – and no less importantly – to the rest of our neighbourhood in this interconnected world. Thus, I voted in favour of all amendments and in favour of the report, which is in line with the strategy of taking ambitious and realistic action towards achieving the programme. Responsible economic growth should – in the 21st century – be part of every policy, and not only those related to the environment, in order to ensure that our heritage is respected and that the world is protected for our descendants.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission must come forward with an ambitious Seventh Framework Action Programme as soon as possible. I support calls to phase out environmentally harmful subsidies by 2020 and to set achievable targets in other areas, namely, targets for renewable energy, emission reductions and energy efficiency. I support calls for the 7th EAP to integrate environmental protection into other EU policy areas such as industry and agriculture. Furthermore, I support requests to better enforce EU waste legislation, and I call on the Commission to come forward with more ambitious targets for recycling. Finally, the report outlines the need for sustainability criteria for biomass and biofuels to ensure the sustainability of land use.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I abstained on paragraph 65 of the report which calls for transferring income tax to protecting resources and the fight against pollution. Tax reform must be comprehensive if it is to be effective. As it is described here, such a transfer could only maintain the current levels of taxation. There is again still more to be done if we are to turn fine words into action.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There are positive aspects to this report. It advocates a ‘right framework to ensure adequate funding’ for ‘innovation, research and development’; it argues that funding for environmental objectives should take into consideration protecting ‘biodiversity and forestry’, and efficient and sustainable resource use, thereby providing the required ‘synergy with the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE)’; and it advocates ‘planning sufficient resources for the conservation of the Natura 2000 Network’ and fully including environmental protection as an important part of the next multiannual financial framework (MFF). The removal of references to the market and placing responsibility on producers are positive amendments. However, we would stress that European Union economic policy in general is incompatible with its proclaimed objectives of environmental protection.</p>
