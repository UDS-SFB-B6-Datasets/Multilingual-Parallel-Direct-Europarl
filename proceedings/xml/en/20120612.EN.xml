      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak during the European Parliament’s debate on this important matter.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is said that politics is the art of putting off decisions until they are no longer relevant. I do not agree. We are in politics in order to take decisions, decisions for the benefit of the population, including when these decisions are not popular. I am sure that that applies to all of us here today.</p>
      <p sl="da">The decision to change the legal basis for the proposal for the Schengen evaluation mechanism is not equally popular in all quarters. I am happy to admit that. It is necessary, however, if we are to achieve the results that Europe needs. Given the positions of the Member States, this was the only possible decision in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="da">The EU is there to benefit the citizens of Europe, and creating a European community without internal borders is one of the greatest achievements in our history, European history. It is our responsibility to safeguard that victory. An absolutely crucial prerequisite for maintaining an EU without internal borders is the confidence that the Member States will live up to their obligations under the Schengen rules.</p>
      <p sl="da">There has been a strong political will for many years to bolster the Schengen evaluation mechanism. A year ago, the European Council called for the evaluation system to be strengthened in order to effectively meet the challenges facing us and for the establishment of a special mechanism to deal with extraordinary situations, where Schengen collaboration as such is at risk. It is these two proposals that make up what is known as the Schengen governance package, which was put forward in September last year.</p>
      <p sl="da">Both the Polish and the Danish Presidencies have worked intensively on the two proposals in the Council. I am therefore also satisfied to have achieved a unanimous Council last week in order to provide a common response to the challenges facing Schengen cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="da">There has subsequently been a specific focus on one of the elements of the Council’s common response, namely, the changing of the legal basis for the Schengen evaluation proposal from Article 77(2)(e) to Article 70 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. There were, however, a number of elements to what was decided by the Council. First of all, there was political unanimity on the content of the Schengen evaluation mechanism, including a change of legal basis from Article 77(2)(e) to Article 70. Next, there was the decision – and I would very much like to emphasise this clearly at this point – to consult Parliament in accordance with Article 19(7)(h) of the Council’s Rules of Procedure in order to ensure that Parliament’s position is taken into account as far as possible before the final text is adopted. Thirdly, there was a general approach on the content of the proposal to reintroduce border controls. These three factors thus constitute the basis for the first informal trialogue with the European Parliament in respect of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="da">This is an important decision, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain the change from Article 77 to Article 70. First of all, it is important for me to make it clear that, if we were to have a stronger evaluation mechanism, it was necessary to change the legal basis. The alternative was that we would not have a new evaluation mechanism, as it was not possible to reach agreement in the Council on a proposal that could be adopted under Article 77. I am absolutely convinced that we, as publicly elected politicians, best fulfil our responsibility towards the electorate by keeping the focus strictly on our obligation to also get results. In the Council, there was one possibility, and one possibility alone, for us to achieve this result. Clearly, that opportunity must not be wasted. In that connection, I would also like to stress that the Council was unanimous in endorsing the decision to change the legal basis. I would also like to point out, in this regard, that, with this decision, the Council followed the very clear pronouncements of its legal service in respect of the proposal. As a third point, the Council did, in fact, make it very clear that it wanted to take into account all the aspects of Parliament’s position as it moves forward with this matter.</p>
      <p sl="da">I therefore hope that it is absolutely clear, given what I have just said, that the decision to change the legal basis is a purely legal decision based solely on content and not politics. For that reason, honourable Members of this House, it would be entirely wrong to turn this into a fight between the Council and Parliament. Nothing, honourable Members, could be more wrong and more destructive to our common desire for stronger Schengen cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is important for me to stress that the Council proposes continued dialogue on the whole Schengen package, not just the proposal on border controls, but also the proposal on the evaluation mechanism. Given the serious challenges that the EU currently faces, there is a need for close cooperation, in which we all come together to find answers to the challenges. Only through collaboration can we come up with the solutions that Europe’s citizens expect of us. The Danish Presidency therefore attaches an extraordinarily high degree of importance to close collaboration with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="da">From day one, we have had very close contact with the rapporteur for the Schengen evaluation proposal, Mr Coelho. The same applies to other Members of this House. We have listened, and ensured influence for Parliament, we have had sound and constructive dialogue, and that is something that I would like to thank you all for. I was therefore also pleased to hear that, in a debate in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on Thursday, 31 May, the rapporteur for the proposal recognised the Presidency’s efforts to incorporate Parliament’s views into the text, which has now achieved unanimous support in the Council. With this proposal, we have taken a major step in the right direction, and that is thanks in no small part to the efforts of Mr Coelho and other honourable Members of this House.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is thus a strong desire on Parliament’s part that has helped ensure that the Council’s compromise also includes the absence of controls at internal borders. It is also partly thanks to Parliament’s efforts that the Council’s compromise provides for an increased role for the Commission, the possibility of unannounced evaluation visits, the fact that the evaluation mechanism applies to both first and second mandate evaluations and, finally, also a high degree of transparency, with regular reports to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="da">We have had close contact, and it is therefore certainly not a surprise to the Presidency to hear points discussed here that are important to Parliament. What is more, the proposal on the Schengen Borders Code continues to be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, with Parliament as the colegislator.</p>
      <p sl="da">I mention this because I know that the issue of the re-introduction of border controls is a subject close to Parliament’s heart. It was therefore also important to the Presidency to have the politically sensitive provisions on that very ability to re-introduce border controls transferred to the proposal on the Schengen Borders Code. By moving these provisions, we ensured that Parliament continues to be colegislator in respect of these absolutely key provisions, despite the change of legal basis for the proposal on the evaluation mechanism. At one stage, there was a proposal to transfer the provisions on the re-introduction of border controls back into the evaluation mechanism. However, that was something that the Presidency and many other Member States opposed. If they had been moved back, it would have been understandable for Parliament to be critical of the Council’s actions, but that was not the case.</p>
      <p sl="da">Honourable Members of the European Parliament, the fact that today we have an EU without internal borders is the result of many years’ worth of efforts, and it is therefore important to see the bigger picture in respect of this proposal. With the Council’s compromise, we are paving the way for a more EU-based model and, as the outcome of the debate at the meeting of the Council last week showed, it is key for the Council to involve Parliament to the greatest possible extent in the wider work on the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="da">I look forward to the debate today, which I am pleased is taking place. None of us should be in any doubt that the Council wants to continue a close dialogue with Parliament on this matter. The Presidency has enjoyed close collaboration with Parliament on this important proposal for Europe’s future. Honourable Members, it is our joint task now to push this proposal forward. The citizens of Europe expect that of us. Thank you for giving me the floor.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will try to stay calm, even though I am absolutely seething. Minister, we had already been provoked, and you have provoked us even further this morning. However, I will stay calm.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">By deciding unanimously, against the opinion of the European Commission, to alter the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism, the interior ministers have made a decision that is completely unacceptable to the Group of the European People’s Party. I would like to thank Ms Malmström for the courage she showed right to the end. She did not bend under pressure from the Council.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Malmström, we will need the Commission over the next few weeks, as the debates will be tough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Minister, I am surprised that you did not introduce visas at the same: you would have protected our 500 million consumers even more.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">By proposing this initiative, you have broken the bond of trust with this Parliament: this initiative has broken the fundamental principle of the community method in a very dangerous way and, as you know, I am very attached to that principle. You have attacked it and you will find us blocking your way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This principle prevents the larger Member States from imposing their will on the smaller States. It ensures that Europe’s general interest comes before national interests. You have broken that, my friend. The European Parliament and Commission are the guardians of this community method, and we have no intention of giving up on it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last Thursday, I asked the Presidency of the Council, in the person of Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is a former member of the European Parliament herself, to appear before this Parliament to explain her position. She telephoned me yesterday evening, and I think she ought to have been here this morning, because the community method is important and she knows what she is talking about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Danish Presidency does not have enough respect for Europe’s 500 million citizens to even bother to tell them why it has denied its Members of Parliament the right of codecision on a subject as important as freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as I am concerned, since the evening of 7 June, the Danish Presidency is over. Between now and midnight on 30 June, we will address either the Council or the incoming Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus. You should know that I had to think long and hard before saying that, but you have broken the community method. That is something that must not be done.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when the economic and social crisis we are going through calls for a spirit of solidarity, responsibility and respect from everyone and from all our national and European leaders, you have broken that respect. By withdrawing their trust in Parliament, the Member States are going in the opposite direction to the one that will allow us to come out of the crisis from the top down: in other words, via political integration between us. The solution to our problems is not to withdraw behind our borders; quite the opposite: the solution is shared sovereignty and joint management, in a spirit of mutual trust and of respect for the thing we hold most dear: our freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our group asks the Council to reverse its decision. Only by doing this will it be able to come back to this European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Bødskov, some said that I would have a hard time today, with a social democratic government and presidency, but you have made it very easy for me. Everything that you have said, we are opposed to. We had an extensive discussion within the group yesterday and we concluded in unison that we are strongly opposed to what you have done. We reject the position that you have just expressed.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament takes a clear view that you have gone down the wrong road, and a dangerous one at that. You have the experience of Denmark. Did you not learn anything from your predecessors in office, from how the government came under pressure from right-wing populists? You should surely have learned that that is not the right way to go! Unfortunately, you learnt nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I come back, now, to the quoted reasons for this move? We were told that there was a mass stampede of Tunisians to Europe. That was the origin of this debate. Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sarkozy agreed that they simply had to close the borders, as if that would solve the problem! So, where are these millions of refugees in Europe all of a sudden, the ones to which you have to react, Mr Bødskov? Instead, we have something else. The Europeans intervened in Libya, an intervention I fully supported. Millions of refugees fled from Libya to Tunisia. Because, as before, there are many Libyan refugees in Tunisia, does that mean that we might have to close our borders, or make it easier to do so? Is that our response to the Arab Spring? That is the wrong answer, Mr Bødskov, absolutely the wrong answer.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I agree that there is a problem – a problem on the border between Turkey and Greece. So, then, should we close our borders, because that is the only way to solve that problem? Is there no one left in this Europe who argues that we need to show solidarity, we need to help ensure that this border is made secure against illegal immigrants? Has it, then, become the custom in Europe to respond to populist demands? Does the Danish Presidency also go along with this? That, if you ask me, is a scandal, and we find it unacceptable.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">You then have the gall to come here and tell us that we should actually be grateful to you for preventing something worse from happening. Is that your impression of the European Parliament, that we would get down on the floor and say ‘Thank you, Presidency, you prevented permanent new borders in Europe’?</p>
      <p sl="de">I know why the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers locked out Parliament. It did so because this institution, together with the Commission – and I would like to add my thanks to the Commissioner – has always been the institution that has defended the European accomplishment that is freedom of movement. We have defended it in many debates. Given that you know that there would be opposition here in Parliament if borders were to be closed again without reason, you have removed from Parliament the right of codecision in the evaluation. If you listen to some Justice and Home Affairs ministers – and I am thinking of some quite specific people – then you know how the land lies, and then you know people’s reasons for wanting this. Indeed, a few of the ministers want to have more options to close borders before elections – as was the case in Denmark – or on other occasions. That is the reason, and we reject it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The S&amp;D Group, like the other groups in this House, is unanimous, and we will pursue all avenues – political and legal – to fight against what you have begun. You are opening a door to right-wing populism in Europe. I am sorry that it is the Danish Presidency that is opening this door.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, next Thursday – in two days’ time – we will celebrate Schengen’s 27th birthday. So let me thank the Minister very much for the gift.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a shame that we are having this debate today. In fact it is a disgrace. Certainly it is a disgrace, Mr Minister when, a few minutes before starting this debate, you publish a press statement in Danish – and we have some Danish Members who will be able to read that – saying that this agreement is good for Europe and that it has been the outcome of a very deep dialogue with the EU Commission and with the EU Parliament. That is what it says in the statement released by your services this morning, just a few minutes ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">Well, Mr Minister, we are no longer living in the Middle Ages. In the Middle Ages, there was a dialogue between the King and the Parliament, but today we live in the 21st century. It is not based on dialogue but on codecision in a modern society and in a modern parliament. So we do not need your dialogue. What we need is for you to recognise the powers of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">In fact, colleagues, this dispute is not about the power of the European Parliament. It is, in fact, a question of an attempt by the Council to renationalise Schengen by doing two things: first of all. changing the legal basis so that this Parliament lies outside the decision-making process and secondly – and more importantly – by clearly stating that implementation of the new acquis will be delegated to the Council and not to the Commission. So this is not an attack against Parliament but, more importantly, an attack against the Commission, against the communitarian method, and against the fact that Schengen is a full part of European Union policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is an even bigger scandal is that the United Kingdom, which is not in Schengen and has an opt-out, will be treated better than Parliament. Under Article 70, the UK will continue to be present at the negotiations –without having a say, apparently, but it will be present – but this Parliament will not.</p>
      <p sl="de">So we have to take clear action today. Firstly, I think we need to go to court.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, why is it necessary to pay for all this? If they want to renationalise, let them renationalise, for example, and then pay for the Schengen acquis themselves. Instead, it is the European Union which has to do it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, Minister, why are we continuing with you on Justice and Home Affairs? Why continue with the Dublin II report on asylum? We have a trialogue on 19 June. Why is it necessary to go on with it? Why continue with the Díaz de Mera report on the visa safeguard clause? We have two trialogues in the next two weeks. Why are we continuing with this? Why are we continuing with the Weber report on the reintroduction of border controls if we have no say on the Coelho report? Why should we continue in any way with you, the Danish Presidency? Why are we not suspending all talks on Justice and Home Affairs until the new Presidency is in place?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Bødskov, ladies and gentlemen, for me, the worst thing is that I get the impression that the Danish Presidency is acting against its better judgment. All the conversations I have had have led me to conclude that, in Denmark, in the government there that just recently wanted to bring about pro-European progress in the discussion on Schengen, people are actually well aware that there cannot be a happy ending where social democrats are following right-wing populists.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, in terms of content, everything has already been said, except one aspect that I would like to re-emphasise. I actually find it deeply shocking that a Danish Presidency of the Council, with which my group sought close cooperation, should today declare its distrust of the European Parliament overall, and not only that, but its distrust on an issue that is relevant to our citizens right across Europe. We are not trusted, in the conflict between freedom and security, to make decisions to the benefit of the well-being of our citizens. There are former Heads of Government who are now Members of this House. You know them all. Why do you, why do the Justice and Home Affairs ministers of the European Union, believe that we in this House cannot be trusted with the security of our citizens?</p>
      <p sl="de">For me, that is absolutely scandalous, and I believe that you are performing something of an emperor’s new clothes trick. Since Europe’s citizens are so insecure as a result of the financial and economic crisis, you are resorting to an arena that really should not be occupied in this populist way. You are taking an axe to one of the greatest achievements of the European Union, freedom of movement, and that is truly shameful. We will take this to court. I am certain that – in contrast to what you said – today is not a good day in your Presidency for Denmark and for Europe. It is the saddest day of your Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, was surprised by the Council’s move to change the legal base of Schengen, but I am even more surprised by colleagues’ reactions here today. This is a time for cool heads and calm consideration. We should not be reacting with a childish tantrum and by throwing our toys out of the pram. We are in very challenging times in Europe and we need good working relations with all the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our first step should be to investigate the legal consequences of the Council’s actions, but I have sympathy with the Member States who unanimously agreed on the change of legal base. The evaluation mechanism is linked to the proposal on temporary border controls, both of which we voted on in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) last night. In both cases, we have seen proposals from the Commission to create a Brussels-based Schengen governance, and in both cases the Member States strongly disagree, with solid arguments.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will recall Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that ‘national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State’. In my view, the management of a country’s borders is directly linked to matters of national security. I understand why Member States do not want to give up this competence, so let us proceed in an ordered and sensible way with cool heads, rather than this unnecessary reaction.</p>

      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, the EU’s open borders represent the most important symbol of the Union around the world, and they have a deep allure to many people across the globe. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, as you know, have always criticised the fact that the EU is also associated with fencing off the outside at the same time. That is precisely the reason why it was so important to us to retain a built-in European emergency mechanism, but the Council was up in arms about that idea. I can only say to you that what you are doing here, what you, the Council, are celebrating, is troglodytic. Go back to the basic principles of the Community! I beg you to do that! Put an end to this kind of, ultimately, anti-European politics. Ladies and gentlemen, the policy of the Council in this case is anti-democratic, as it seeks to downgrade Parliament to the status of a consulted body. We will not tolerate this, however. We have it in writing, we have a Treaty right to codecision, and we intend to – and will – exercise that right.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that the Council’s decision is deeply anti-European because it nationalises Schengen. I ask you, the Council, the Danish Presidency: do you want to bring back the customs borders? Do you want to go back to the 19th century? What signs are you hoping to send to the outside world with this decision? You are making yourselves look ridiculous to the world, and to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is that this decision by the Council is populist, in the truest sense of the word, and provides a boost to the forces of nationalism, exactly those people who want to retreat to the nations and destroy the Europe that we have built. We cannot settle for that. I appeal to you to take back your decision, and be Europeans again!</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Member States have decided to take responsibility for border security back into their own hands. The European Parliament will no longer play any role in this. Mr Verhofstadt, speaking in his own name as well as on behalf of the delegations of D66 and the Dutch People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), has called this decision a declaration of war. However, it is, in fact, the European Parliament that is waging a war against Member States. This Parliament has done nothing to stop the influx of illegal immigrants. This Parliament does not want to take notice of the problems caused by cross-border crime.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Member States are making a choice in favour of security and, therefore, against this Parliament. Member States are making a choice in favour of their citizens and, therefore, against this Parliament. The fact that Parliament is opposed to such decisions only shows that Member States are being very sensible. Mr President, Member States ought to take a whole lot more policies back home, back to the national parliaments, which are the actual bodies that represent their people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This House, Mr President, should abolish itself. Not only is that a much cheaper solution, but it would also be a step in the direction of peace and security.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a year ago, there was a lot of anxiety about Schengen. There was fear of unilateral actions on unclear grounds. There was uncertainty over how to act in cases of real persistent problems at borders and under what conditions borders could temporarily be reinstalled.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council asked the Commission to bring forward proposals to strengthen Schengen and to enable it to deal with future crises. It asked for a European-based mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">In September last year, the Commission brought forward such a proposal. It brought forward a proposal on a European-based evaluation to enable the Commission, together with Member State experts and their agencies, to detect problems early at our borders in order to be able to identify what could be done, to propose remedies, to activate all our tools and to present an action plan that would be compulsory and that the Commission would monitor. This would replace the peer-to-peer review that we have today and which has proven to be quite useless.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legal basis for this would be Article 77, because only then would there be a robust evaluation with binding impact and an increase in political legitimacy, as the European Parliament would be a colegislator. This is not just a legal proposal; it is also a political ambition.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">The other proposal was on the Schengen border code, which is also a European mechanism for the reintroduction of borders as a last resort and is linked to the evaluation mechanism. Such a situation might arise when everything else has been tried. Member States are masters of their borders, but Schengen is a joint European achievement and very much cherished by our citizens. New borders will affect citizens, business, trade, jobs and growth, and that is why any decision to reinstall borders cannot be taken unilaterally. It must be a European decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Commission side, there is clear disappointment at the decision by the Council. It adds very little to current rules; we are creating a system where there is no real enforcement decision that can be followed up at EU level and it does not equip us to fight abuse or populist movements arising from domestic pressure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate the European Parliament’s support for this and am convinced that the last has not been said on this matter. We also took note of the vote yesterday in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). The Commission will work on this file together with Parliament, and I count on Parliament’s support to work towards a stronger Schengen to the benefit of our citizens, where we defend security but also freedom of movement for citizens, business, jobs and growth so that we have clear and transparent European rules for evaluation and decision making.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to offer my thanks for today’s very lively debate and for the opportunity to provide Parliament with a direct account of the Council’s discussions on the Schengen evaluation mechanism. I have listened very carefully to the arguments and views put forward today, and there is one point I would like to stress, which is that all the questions about the introduction of border controls that the honourable Members of this House have raised are part of the ordinary legislative procedure. It is therefore a misunderstanding to say that Parliament is unable to influence such questions.</p>
      <p sl="da">It seems to me there is no justification for anyone to attempt to make this into an expression of some major struggle between the Council and Parliament. The changing of the legal basis was a necessary consequence of the content-related compromises that we managed to reach in the Council. The Council’s discussions on the content of the proposal very clearly showed that it would have been impossible to achieve the required majority for a proposal that could be based on Article 77.</p>
      <p sl="da">There can be no doubt that the Council fully recognises that the Council and Parliament have a completely equal interest in ensuring a sound and properly functioning Schengen system. In this connection, I would therefore also like to recognise, and offer my thanks for, the driving force that Parliament has constantly represented in relation to the development of Schengen cooperation. In many cases, Parliament has been a crucial factor in the ongoing adaptation and development of that cooperation, and therefore it is also to a large extent to Parliament’s credit that the Schengen system has been equipped to face the challenges that have arisen on a regular basis. For many years, Mr Coelho has been practically the personification of that drive, and it is my clear hope that we will continue, in future, to make good use of Mr Coelho’s insight and dedication to this cause.</p>
      <p sl="da">Despite the voices of disagreement that have been raised today, I am certain that the crucial question for all of us is how we can together ensure a better framework for, and better administration of, Schengen cooperation. It is to that end that the Council has now tabled its offer in the shape of the proposals that were agreed on Thursday. The Council and the Danish Presidency have been in constant dialogue with Parliament on this matter, and I feel that the many discussions that we have had on all the elements of the Schengen governance package have been both constructive and rewarding. It was crucial for the Danish Presidency to work to ensure that Parliament’s main concerns were reflected in the compromise agreed by the Council. I believe that the Presidency has succeeded in this to a very great extent, and the Presidency therefore also has high hopes that the end result for all elements of the Schengen governance package will be satisfactory for both the Council and Parliament. The ball is now in Parliament’s court. When it comes to the Schengen Borders Code, Parliament will have its usual role as colegislator to play. In relation to the Schengen evaluation mechanism, Parliament will be informed of the results of the negotiations in the Council. As I stressed in my introductory remarks, however, the Council proposes close dialogue on the whole package, not just the proposal on border controls, but also the proposal on the evaluation mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="da">It was very clear from the discussions in the Council over the last week that the Council does want to take account, to the greatest possible extent, of the views expressed in Parliament in connection with consultation. Let me therefore be absolutely clear: the Council has the strongest possible wish and the strongest possible desire to enter into close dialogue with Parliament about this matter. No one should be in any doubt that the Council does have the best of intentions. The reality, after all, is that only if the Council and Parliament join forces can we achieve the results that we absolutely need and that are also expected of us.</p>
      <p sl="da">In light of that, I look forward to further collaboration on this issue, and I look forward to entering into close and constructive dialogue with Parliament. I know that the same also applies to the incoming Presidency. I now very much look forward to Parliament bringing forward its formal communication of your position on this matter. I will take the many views that have been aired here today back with me to the Council, and I would like to offer my thanks to you once more for the opportunity to be present here today and to provide you with a more detailed account of the negotiations on this matter in the Council.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr Bødskov, ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your attention for one moment, please. Mr Bødskov. I get the impression that the delight about the continuation of this debate is very much only on one side. Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure provides that a speaker who is directly addressed should be given the opportunity to make a personal statement at the end of the debate. This applies to the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, who has been addressed a number of times. I therefore give him the floor pursuant to Rule 151.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Danish Presidency started well with Minister Bødskov’s pragmatic approach, but finished badly due to the Council’s intransigence. The Council has demonstrated that it does not trust this Parliament and, more significantly, it has shown negative signs of a return to the mentality that existed before the Treaty of Lisbon. I accuse the Council of not wanting to strengthen freedom of movement. I accuse the Council of being obsessed with multiplying, enlarging and enhancing the reintroduction of controls on internal borders. I accuse the Council of not wanting a true evaluation of Schengen, which would identify the problems, lead to their resolution and strengthen the security of our citizens. I accuse the Council of wanting to retain the existing system under which, as Cecilia Malmström put very well, the Member States hide and ignore each other’s mistakes and shortcomings. I accuse the Council of rejecting a European mechanism and of going back to a tired and outdated intergovernmental model. Mr President, finally, I accuse the Council of a dangerous madness and, as several other speakers have highlighted during this debate, renationalising the Schengen project is undesirable.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would just like to take the opportunity – as Mr Coelho has just spoken – to thank him for the close collaboration that we enjoyed and for being a close sparring partner for the Danish Presidency for a prolonged period in connection with this proposal. I would also like to thank him for recognising that the Presidency has listened. The House’s views will now be taken back to the Council, and I hope that we can use them as a starting point for a continued constructive dialogue in order to ensure that we achieve what we all have an interest in, namely, a dialogue about how we can bolster Schengen cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">A year ago, the Council condemned the unilateral actions of countries restoring border controls and obliged the Commission to present specific proposals on how to strengthen the protection of the Schengen area and the management of the EU’s external borders. Nevertheless, it is now becoming clear that governments do not see the Schengen area as a common European achievement or common value. Member States do not wish to establish the centralised European border management mechanism proposed by the European Commission, of which the European Parliament has repeatedly expressed its approval. Heads of Government would apparently find it unacceptable to have an independent and impartial arbiter who would monitor how the Member States are complying with the provisions of the Schengen acquis . In my opinion, so that we can continue to ensure a successful area of free movement in the European Union, we simply need to strive for the creation of an independent evaluation and supervision mechanism, the functioning of which would be based on democratic principles. That is why it is illogical to allow the Member States to assess their own performance in carrying out border controls, particularly those Member States on the EU’s external borders where controls must be tighter. In my opinion, recent events have demonstrated the shortcomings of the current mechanism in which Member States have a decisive role. As nationalistic movements are being ignited more frequently and clearly, mutual trust among Member States will soon collapse. I therefore hope that the measures we, the European Parliament, will take, will be effective and that EU citizens will be able to continue to take advantage of the freedom of movement without hindrance.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The decision made by the Justice and Home Affairs Council regarding the right of Schengen area Member States to reintroduce national border controls temporarily is a great and regrettable backward step in the process of European integration. It is also a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, which establish the codecision procedure involving the Council and Parliament. It marks an outrageous switch from the constantly restrictive attitude hitherto adopted by the Council regarding the freedom of movement issue to removing Parliament from the decision-making process on the Schengen area. This abuse is likely to compromise both the Community spirit and the institutional and regulatory framework forming the basis of the European Union. The tendency in favour of renationalising the Schengen area, on its 27th anniversary, under pressure from the national and populist trends which are against the free movement of citizens, is unacceptable. Indeed, changing the legal basis of the mechanism for evaluating the implementation of the Schengen rules is tantamount to Parliament being relegated from the position of codecider, as specified in Article 77 of the Treaty of Lisbon, to a purely consultative position. This is a two-pronged attack against open borders – one of the major hallmarks of the European Union – and against the only European forum directly representing citizens’ wishes.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Council’s decision to change the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism is unacceptable for at least two reasons. Firstly, it is a serious violation of the Treaties and of the principle of sincere cooperation between institutions, thereby helping to foster a spirit of distrust between the European institutions. Secondly, apart from the legal and interinstitutional considerations, the Council’s approach even jeopardises the Schengen area’s integrity. The evaluation mechanism proposed by the Council will not make any improvement compared to the current system, and is the opposite of Parliament’s desired option, which is a European evaluation system where the Commission plays the key role. In practical terms, Member States would like to continue sweeping the problems at the Schengen borders under the carpet instead of promoting an effective evaluation mechanism involving both assistance in the event of shortcomings and sanctions when they are required. Parliament cannot accept such an approach to the Schengen area and is prepared to take the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Council does not reconsider its position.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The decision of Member State interior ministers to change the legal basis for the formation of a new Schengen evaluation mechanism from Article 77 to Article 70 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, and thus from codecision on the part of the European Parliament, as originally proposed by the Commission, to mere consultation, is absolutely unacceptable. The ministers want to chip away at one of the cornerstones of the European Union, and one of the EU’s fundamental rights – the right to freedom of movement – by means of non-transparent intergovernmental agreements without the participation or democratic control of the European Parliament. This opens the door to unilateral action and closes the door to the European monitoring that is needed for protecting workforce mobility. Member State governments have again shown that they do not respect the EU’s sole democratic institution. In recent years, I have repeatedly taken the Commission to task over the controls on the Czech-German border, which are absurd, discriminatory and, above all, a violation of the Schengen Code. The Commission has finally begun to address this problem effectively. Now, all European citizens are being dealt a blow by their own governments, which want to close them up within the old administrative borders any time they like. Bringing back borders in this way is a retrograde step for our freedom, our economy and our further development. I believe that the European Parliament will find a way of blocking this, and I am personally very curious as to what the European Court of Justice will have to say about this approach taken by the ministers.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Other Members from various political groups have now reacted strongly to the Council’s decision not to include the European Parliament in the decision-making process with regard to the Schengen acquis . This is yet again a woeful example of how attempts are being made to trample underfoot the powers granted to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At present, the Committee on Culture and Education is debating the Europe for Citizens Programme, and there is a similar dispute about the legal basis going on in this connection. According to the Commission and the Council, Parliament has no say in what the programme should consist of, although this is an initiative that relates very closely to ordinary people. It is indeed strange that an institution that is elected by means of direct democratic elections and which represents 500 million Europeans should not be able to decide on the content of decisions that affect Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now the same thing is happening with Schengen. Free mobility is one of the EU’s greatest achievements and one of the most tangible rights of the EU citizen. I am astonished that the Council wants to strip Parliament of the role which the very same Member States granted it at Lisbon. The dangers connected with all this are a weakening of the rights of the individual, a deterioration in democratic principles, and a decline in cooperation between Parliament and the Council in the future. The Council has adopted an anti-European stance.</p>

      <p sl="en">The solution is not for Member States to kick countries out of Schengen because they cannot cope with irregular migration, but to work together to ensure that this situation does not happen. The value of the EU is in seeking common solutions to common problems rather than an ‘every man for himself’ attitude which inevitably means that the smaller and poorer countries struggle. The countries that directly border non-EU countries, or are islands, already face a disproportionately high burden, and the question of absorption capacity has become particularly acute following the Arab Spring. My own country, Malta, has seen over 700 irregular migrants arrive in the last month which, when taken on a per capita basis, is akin to Germany having to cope with 400 000 people. The Dublin agreement forms the basis of a common EU approach to immigration. We need a combination of burden sharing and financial assistance so that asylum seekers and economic migrants can have their cases judged swiftly and fairly. Passport-free movement guaranteed under Schengen is one of the major achievements of the EU. It would be a shame to see it unravel because of politicians pandering to populist prejudice rather than seeking a solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">The members of the Council insist that the Schengen legal basis is in need of change merely because they want powers to reintroduce the internal borders within the EU. This is utter populism, since internal borders do not improve the life and security of the citizens, but put limits on their freedom. It is clear that the Council intends to renationalise the Schengen project, and to go back to an outdated intergovernmental approach. More than seeking to satisfy the ego of one of the European institutions, this reflects the demagogic approach of the dialogue with the national societies, rather than the concern for the security of the citizens. The change in the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism should be considered only in terms of finding the correct paths for the implementation and putting into effect of the Schengen acquis . The Member States gathered in the Council want to control and change the Schengen mechanism as they please, not for improving it, but for hiding their incapacity to improve the life of the citizens by presenting the freedom of movement as the source of all evils.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Council’s decision to amend the legal basis for decisions imposing temporary restrictions on the free movement of persons limits the European Parliament’s involvement in such decisions, and is thus nothing other than an infringement of the Treaties which should be taken to the European Court of Justice.

      <p sl="nl">The Council’s decision to sideline the European Parliament in the reform of the Schengen Agreement lays the way open for an attack on the fundamental rights of European citizens. If Parliament is not given any say over Schengen’s evaluation mechanisms, we will no longer have democratic scrutiny of decisions which could even lead to the temporary reintroduction of passport controls. This is unacceptable. The Council should review its decision because it erodes the principles and basic freedoms of the European Union, in particular, free movement of people. I therefore fully support the proposals that have been put forward so that we, as Parliament, can resolutely counteract this decision. Firstly, by political means, that is, by suspending the ongoing negotiations with the Council, and then legally, that is, by taking all necessary steps to prepare an action and bring it before the Court of Justice. What we need in these difficult times through which the EU is currently struggling is more solidarity and more trust; we need a European approach and European solutions. What we do not need is the erosion of European institutions, putting national interests first and allowing the demands of the large Member States to prevail.</p>

      <p sl="de">For months now, the European Parliament has been negotiating what has become known as the Schengen package under the ordinary legislative procedure. Suddenly, however, the interior ministers changed the legal basis (Article 70), aiming to transfer responsibility for this to the Member States. Behind this perhaps seemingly technical issue hides the basic question behind all European politics: are the Community and its institutions to make decisions based on community principles or are the national governments to perform that function based on more or less agreed positions – in other words, are decisions to be made on a Community or intergovernmental basis? Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has developed more and more into an institution that stands above national special interests. This could, perhaps, act as a brake against populist politics, which occurs regularly in many Member States, especially in the run-up to national elections. It seems clear that Europe’s interior ministers fear that the European Parliament takes its role as guardian of European fundamental rights seriously.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to recap on why this report has come back to the plenary sitting today, after having been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON).</p>
      <p sl="fr">The regulation on countries experiencing difficulties, for which I was rapporteur, was adopted by 25 votes to 4, with 13 abstentions. The abstentions were primarily by the Socialists. However, they did vote in favour of most of the amendments and all of the compromise amendments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before opening the negotiations, which, from what we have been hearing from the Presidency, will not be easy, I felt it was important to obtain a more solid mandate from plenary. When the time comes, therefore, I will ask that we do not proceed with the vote on the legislative resolution so that, if applicable, we can secure an agreement at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This draft regulation on strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area is set against the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that the European Union is facing and will continue to face. The Union is trying to learn lessons from the crisis, and to propose solutions. The Commission’s proposals complement the package on economic governance: the ‘six-pack’ adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2011. Excessive national debt can have dramatic consequences, both within the countries concerned and for the other Member States of the European Union. The difficulties of a small country can even have global repercussions. What is at risk is the euro area’s reputation, rather than its existence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The serious economic and social consequences that some Member States are experiencing today could have been avoided if early, targeted action had been taken. At the time, the European Union did not have the necessary instruments, but this will now be put right by the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and two new pieces of legislation (the ‘two-pack’), including this one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘six-pack’ needs to be strengthened, in order to ensure both financial stability and economic growth in the euro area. Several Member States have had to seek financial assistance. Preventive action at an early stage is preferable to corrective measures taken later – perhaps too late – in the proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The broad thrust of the draft regulation adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is in line with the original proposal, which provides for a Member State whose currency is the euro to be subject to enhanced surveillance when it is experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, severe financial disturbance. It should be swiftly returned to a normal situation and the other euro area Member States should be protected against possible negative spillover effects. The regulation sets out clear procedures to this effect for countries experiencing difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The parliamentary committee was keen to increase the powers that the original proposal gave the Commission, in particular, by introducing wider use of the reverse qualified majority rule in Council votes. For example, this rule would apply when the Commission recommends that a country should take corrective measures, or when it instructs a country to submit new debt reduction plans. Such decisions would be deemed to have been adopted unless the Council categorically rejected them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is worth mentioning that ECON adopted the protection system for States in major difficulties by a wide majority. I would like to point out that there were no negotiations on this amendment and that the vote was left to each individual’s judgment. A majority of our Members chose not to heed the arguments put forward by detractors of this proposal, which were partly based on a distorted presentation of its objective. The intention is not to organise a restructuring or reduction of the debt, but to allow the State to get itself back into shape so that it can deal with its obligations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the ‘six-pack’ was officially published in the Official Journal on 23 November 2011, the same day on which the Commission published the ‘two-pack’. The ‘two-pack’ is yet another initiative to strengthen the budgetary discipline of the euro area Member States. Now, following the economic governance ‘six-pack’, the conditions have been created for strengthened surveillance of these countries, even before they request help, their budgetary targets have been reinforced and the budgetary timelines have been coordinated. Budgetary discipline has been the start and end point of the Commission’s legislative initiative, with jobs, workers and salaries being the adjustment variable. This ignores the basic fact that if all of the economies in an internal market, including those with surpluses, are forced to practise austerity, the market ends up inexorably contracting. All countries are trying to export to markets that are closing, competing by squeezing salaries, the only variable selected for this purpose. Local demand disappears and, under these conditions, unemployment spreads. Rising unemployment and the loss of tax receipts make the intended rebalancing of the public finances impossible and government debt is left entirely at the mercy of those running the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The ‘two-pack’ legislative initiative was developed in this context, precisely when the fourth EU economy was beginning to show its weakness. As the representatives of our citizens, we can no longer colegislate on initiatives that focus solely on discipline and austerity. The initiatives have to be adjusted and rebalanced. It is therefore essential that improvements made to the legislation are strongly approved and strongly endorsed. They ensure balance between the short-term objectives and the medium-term requirements to correct the imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is greater respect for national democracy in setting national budgets and the need for coordination between Member States is recognised, but there is also respect for social consultation at a national level. In addition, it is also essential for the Commission, as soon as possible, to produce the road map for the only possible firebreak with which to moderate sovereign debt; that is, to jointly manage the debt above 60% through a medium- and long-term fund, to provide some degree of coordination for the short-term management of the bonds for this debt and to produce a road map to achieve the effective and definitive constitution of eurobonds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At the same time, it is essential that the internal demand obstacle and the lack of European stabilising instruments are overcome and, for this purpose, an instrument of 1% of GDP over 10 years is proposed precisely to fill this void. Thirdly, it is fundamental when evaluating deficit levels, debt and the imposition of rules for budgetary rebalancing to protect the strategic investment that enables countries to overcome structural weaknesses.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have come ready to work, to work intensely to build consensus, as our Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and this plenary are mandated to do. This consensus requires sacrifice and compromise, whether within each political group or between different political groups, but we are confident that the vote tomorrow will strongly reinforce the position of this Parliament, which represents our citizens, and that it will allow them to play a constructive role in overcoming the crisis that we are going through.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to participate in this debate on the two proposals so fluently expressed by the rapporteurs, which are intended to strengthen economic governance of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The purpose of the discussion this morning and, of course, of the vote tomorrow, is to establish Parliament’s position in view of upcoming trialogues. I would like to thank, in particular, Ms Ferreira and Mr Gauzès for their dedicated work; we have talked a number of times about their work on these issues and their contribution to establishing Parliament’s positions on the text put forward by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council is keenly awaiting the outcome of your deliberations and looks forward to a constructive trialogue. You will be aware that the Danish Presidency steered discussions in the Council to a rapid conclusion, so that already by 21 February, we were able to adopt a general approach in Council on both these proposals. The general approach of the Council is to close the original proposals of the Commission which we believe to be an important contribution to ensuring sound and sustainable public finance in the euro area and thereby also to growth and employment, with those two things being two sides of the same coin.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed regulation on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability will ensure that surveillance of those Member States under a financial assistance programme or, of course, facing threats of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed regulation on common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficits of the Member States in the euro area will require these countries to present their draft budgetary plans, which will enable the Commission to assess whether the budgetary plans are in accordance with budgetary objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The regulation also proposes closer monitoring and reporting requirements for euro area countries in an excessive deficit procedure. I should add that I remain confident that we will reach an agreement which is acceptable to the Council and Parliament in the end. The two proposals will make an important contribution to further strengthening of the economic governance framework within the euro area and we are ready to start a trialogue as soon as Parliament is ready.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would like to recall, and I should of course do that very briefly, the context in which we are discussing these two proposals. We are all only too well aware of the persistent financial and economic crisis which continues to impact across Europe, and also beyond European borders, despite the reins applied and measures taken after 2010. But having said that, I still think it is important to realise that much has been achieved. We have strengthened economic governance and policy coordination within the framework of the European Semester. The ‘six-pack’ – and I consider this a major achievement by the Council and Parliament, with very close cooperation on very difficult files – has strengthened the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and created a new macro-economic imbalances procedure. We have set up rescue mechanisms such as the EFSM, the EFS and the ESM, and used these facilities to support vulnerable Member States. We have strengthened financial supervision through a European systemic risk board and strengthened the role of the European supervisory authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">As an absolutely crucial part of the EU crisis management strategy, the Council and Parliament are taking major steps on stronger financial regulations. We have agreed, or are in the process of agreeing, on a number of financial regulation files, including new capital requirements of banks, rules on markets for financial derivatives, rules on short selling and credit default swaps, hedge funds and credit rating agencies. Further proposals which will contribute to better regulation of the financial markets are in the pipeline, such as the proposal for an EU framework for bank recovery and resolutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, and hand in hand with our efforts on stronger economic governance and financial regulation, we are working on promoting stronger growth and job creation, with this being done through reforms, initiatives at both national level and European level. However, it is clear that further work is required. The current economic problems have revealed the need for an ever closer policy coordination and decisive action from the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is against this background that honourable Members will be discussing today the ‘two-pack’ proposals which, although only a part of the overall picture, will nevertheless play a key role in the overall strengthening of the coordination of economic policies. Much is at stake, and I therefore have strong hopes that, following your debate today and your vote tomorrow, we can make rapid progress towards reaching an overall agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you of the Danish Presidency’s commitment to this dossier. I also know that, as we are almost at the end of our presidency term, the incoming Cyprus Presidency is equally determined to adopt these proposals as quickly as possible. I look forward very much to your discussion and thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first of all thank the rapporteurs, Mr Gauzès and Ms Ferreira, for their very important work and the Presidency and Minister Margrethe Vestager for their excellent and very effective cooperation on these important files.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for a very substantive and, may I say, constructive economic dialogue yesterday evening in which we discussed the European Semester as well as our strategy for sustainable growth and job creation, and also discussed issues like the recent decision of the euro area to provide a credit line for the restructuring of the Spanish banking sector. We will continue this discussion tomorrow, both in the morning and afternoon, so today we will focus on the ‘two-pack’, which is a very important discussion and decision indeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say a few words about the context of this debate. At the summit later this month – as President Barroso will explain in more detail tomorrow – the Heads of State or Government will discuss the next phase of deepening the economic union. They will discuss possibilities such as a growth compact, a financial union and a fiscal union.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are, yet again, witnessing a potentially defining moment for Europe’s deeper integration. And, once again, this Commission and this Parliament have a special and joint responsibility – a unique responsibility – to prove that the community method can be and will be at the centre of the next chapter in the making of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have little doubt that the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance will be ratified by at least 12 euro area Member States and will thus enter into force. The legislation which is the subject of our debate today has a profound significance in relation to that treaty. That is why it is so important.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first draft regulation, which is the subject of Mr Gauzès’s report, aims at providing more robust and coherent ways of dealing with vulnerable Member States and Member States under a programme, including enhanced economic and budgetary surveillance. I fully agree with Mr Gauzès that prevention is always much better than correction and this regulation was needed in the past two and a half years, even before that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second draft regulation, which is dealt with in Ms Ferreira’s report, aims at establishing a common timeline and common rules to allow for real active prior or ex ante monitoring and assessment of the national budgets of euro area Member States. This regulation was needed during the past 12 years because, once again, prevention is always better than correction, as we have learned the hard way.</p>
      <p sl="en">These proposals, submitted to you on 23 November by the Commission, decisively informed and shaped the subsequent discussions that led to the new Fiscal Compact Treaty. Moreover, the authors of the new treaty explicitly required that certain provisions of the treaty should be achieved through the EU’s normal secondary legislation. They welcomed these specific legislative proposals and clearly saw them as an essential supplement to the treaty itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, of course, the authors of the treaty set out the goal that all provisions of the treaty should be incorporated into the legal framework of the EU by 2018 at the latest. So, the adoption of this legislation is a vital first step in ensuring that the articulation between the Fiscal Compact Treaty and the EU Treaties is done correctly and will set a positive precedent for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that, as colegislator, you have a choice: either to move forward in a timely way or to delay and create a legal grey area. If the treaty enters into force before this ‘two-pack’, we will be confronted with very difficult legal challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">What concerns me most is the political signal that such a scenario would send: no legal acrobatics would enable us to hide the fact that we had failed to live up to our political responsibilities, because Member States would be subject to intergovernmental treaty obligations which had not been translated into EU secondary legislation as planned. Frankly, this would be very bad for the credibility of both the EU Treaty and the community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to acknowledge that, in this respect, the Council has moved quickly. It agreed its mandate to negotiate on these texts within weeks of the signature of the treaty in February. As a former Member of this House, I understand and deeply respect the principles of democratic scrutiny, which means that this House cannot always be as agile as the Council. But I think – and I say this with respect – that after almost seven months for discussion, this should now be the moment to move forward from discussion to negotiation and then to decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council’s negotiating mandate will surely provide us with challenges in the negotiations. I have studied Mr Gauzès’s and Ms Ferreira’s reports. It is already clear that the mandate that you will give to the Economic Affairs Committee will also provide us with some challenges. However, my team and I are ready to roll up our sleeves, get down to serious work with this House and the Council, and get this legislation enacted so that we can move forward. It is in our joint interest not to be institutionally overtaken by yet another intergovernmental agreement.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament welcomes the initiative for the coordinated control of budgetary policies and, in particular, the provisions concerning the creation of a common budgetary schedule, as well as the proposals on the increased surveillance of Member States subject to excessive deficit procedures. Our Committee believes that it is vital for EU budgetary policy to be fully in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to create jobs and facilitate growth. Furthermore, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs finds it important that while budgetary policies are being harmonised and coordinated control is being implemented, Member States should retain their budgetary sovereignty. Last but not least, we consider the provisions that propose the setting of sovereign debt ceilings in Member State constitutions to be important. We welcome the fact that several Member States, including Hungary, have already incorporated such provisions in their new constitutions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would first like to draw attention to the fact that, in spite of my opposition to the philosophy behind this economic governance, and especially to austerity as a means of forcing down Member States’ deficits and debts, my group did not take the approach of rejecting these proposals outright.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We saw it as an opportunity, in the hope that Parliament’s contribution could improve them. Our committee, which is aware of the need for solidarity, was able, for example, to introduce the clause on abiding by collective agreements, to reject the macro-economic conditions for access to the Structural Funds, give Parliament a more important role and national budgets a greater role in implementing the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs incorporated these points to some extent, but generally speaking, in spite of the efforts of our rapporteur, Elisa Ferreira, whom I congratulate, I must share with you my sense of dissatisfaction, especially on the areas that were not within the remit of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs This package reinforces the economic surveillance that my group opposed at the time of the vote on the ‘six-pack’. The procedure is inflexible and applies harsh, uniform formulae to all Member States, regardless of the structure and origin of their debt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After this weekend’s meetings to unblock the aid to Spain, we cannot claim that one size fits all. The Ferreira report contains some sound steps towards new governance approaches but, even with the amendments proposed by our rapporteur, I still fear that the spending needed for growth and jobs will be sacrificed to try to please the markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the current climate in the Council, where growth through stimulus and investment are finally being talked about alongside budgetary discipline, to enshrine in law processes that are out of step with a new political order will not help to soothe the markets and stimulate growth.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the EMU is still limping despite the dozens of measures taken in recent years. The monetary side of things is fully integrated, but the economic base, including the banking system and fiscal union, remain too fragmented at the present time. However, this week we can make another step in the right direction with the adoption of the ‘two-pack’, the proposals for which have just been explained by rapporteurs Gauzès and Ferreira.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has worked very hard to ensure that we get two effective reports here on the table. My hope now, this time, is that all the groups will take their share of the responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the Ferreira report, we have been careful to preserve the core of the Commission’s proposal, to establish a link between financial stability and growth and jobs (which is a ‘both together’ scenario rather than an ‘either/or’ one), to ensure greater respect for national parliaments and to guarantee the independence of Member States’ budgetary institutions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, we have integrated a number of key issues from the budget treaty into this piece of Community legislation, in particular, those relating to binding numerical fiscal rules, an automatic correction mechanism in domestic law and the concept of economic partnership programmes for countries in the excessive deficit procedure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What we have not accepted, nor will accept, is an attempt to weaken the Growth and Stability Pact. We cannot support that because we do not believe that we can solve the debt problem by creating even more debt and, equally, because we do not want to be complicit in making choices that will both burden the next generation and cripple the badly needed restoration of confidence in the short term. We need that confidence, inter alia , for the purposes of further fiscal integration, to which we in the PPE Group, too, are open. Open for a debate on the merits of types of common debt issuance, such as eurobonds and a redemption fund.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nevertheless, this is about sums of money and profound reintegration of such an order that we need to be certain that the conditions and timing are right. That is why we cannot simply slide in a whole new chapter into the articles of this regulation, at the drop of a hat as it were. What we are in favour of, however, is the review clause, which provides the necessary openings and which we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have amended precisely for that purpose.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, as far as economic growth is concerned, we, too, want to collect the required resources. However, setting up a fund quickly in this legislative text, as large as the entire current annual budget of the European Union, without even saying where those resources are coming from, would be implausible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, the PPE Group remains consistent and will vote in the same way tomorrow as we have previously voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as group chair, I volunteered for this debate because I want to emphasise how important this legislation is. For us, this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we have, and I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs, Ms Ferreira and Mr Gauzès, for their work, as well as the other group representatives who helped.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not absolutely sure what Ms Thyssen meant. I hope, at least, that we can reach real agreement, that we will tomorrow have a clear majority in the vote, as was the case in the committee. We support this compromise. We have a single wish that I would like to go into. We support this compromise and it is quite important that Parliament should make its decision with a high degree of unanimity. We say this because, with this legislation – and we need this message to go out to our Heads of State or Government and our citizens, too – we are also fundamentally changing the basic conditions for economic policy and economic governance in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have already done a lot, but we actually did not need the Fiscal Compact at all, as we are creating fundamental new conditions through the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and now the ‘two-pack’. If we were critical at the time of many things in the ‘six-pack’, that makes us even more in favour of the ‘two-pack’, as it corrects and adds a number of elements, so that we really have an overall package here that goes considerably beyond what we had before.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two crucial points to which I would still like to draw attention. I do concede one thing to Ms Thyssen, which is that we need to get past the debts. We can only get past the debts, however, if we also lower the interest rates. We are well aware – as demonstrated by Spain – that we will not get past the debts as long as we have this high interest burden. That being the case, the idea of a debt redemption fund is very much the right way to go. Many of us – me included – believe that we have to go further. We have to move towards eurobonds, with fiscal prerequisites, of course, which are precisely what we are putting in place with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’. Do we now give our support to the compromise on a debt redemption fund? Listening to some of what the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has to say, I have to hope that they do not go through with it, that this is not now rejected again, and that we really are able to hold on to this compromise.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is a special request on the part of Mr Monti. We should not leave Mr Monti high and dry when it comes to investments and specific, very limited, precisely defined growth investments. The situation is that we still have the Europe 2020 targets, but we often do not have the investments. This no longer applies necessarily to the national level, but often to the local level. It is therefore very important to give priority to these investments for growth as that, too, represents a considerable contribution to avoiding the debts if we have growth. To that end, I hope for broad support, a broad consensus, in the vote tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, tomorrow, the ‘two-pack’ will be voted in plenary. After six months of negotiations, we may have a strong Parliament position. We will vote on new rules on enforcing control of Member States’ finances but also on instruments that may help us out of this crisis. I am talking about the European Redemption Fund, an instrument that combines fiscal discipline and European solidarity, which are not contradictory terms.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is our responsibility to show the world that our single currency is irreversible, and that we are not ready to go back to national currencies. In this respect, the European Redemption Fund is the only realistic and achievable debt mutualisation instrument that we can get in the short run. The European Redemption Fund is a voluntary, temporary and partial debt mutualisation tool strongly related to fiscal discipline.</p>
      <p sl="de">Eurobonds will be for the next crisis, not for this crisis. Talking to our citizens about eurobonds as if they were something for next month is populism. We cannot lie to our citizens, ignoring the fact that convergence in fiscal discipline and in a common fiscal stability culture is needed before eurobonds. On the other hand, doing nothing could also be morally unacceptable. While some countries are financing themselves without cost in the short run, other countries are rapidly becoming insolvent due to the increasing cost of their new debt issues. This is why I call on all Members of this Parliament who believe in the European project to vote in favour not only of the two reports, but also of the European Redemption Fund.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Gauzès and Ms Ferreira, and all the other Members. My experience was that we worked very constructively on the content of the two regulations. It was a truly productive experience. In the Gauzès report, we have used the opportunity to further define how the ‘six-pack’ will affect the various countries. Through the discussion that we had at that point, we succeeded in implementing a whole series of improvements.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to Parliament’s ideas, in future, the social impact of each adaptation programme will have to be taken into account. Secondly, in future, the social partners and non-governmental organisations will be consulted in the establishment of the adaptation programmes. Thirdly, in future, the Commission will have to provide transparency in respect of the methods used in calculating the debt sustainability of each country and in forecasting the economic outlook of each country. In the past, we repeatedly saw assumption and massaging of figures. Fourthly, there is to be an audit of the remaining debts in each case. Fifthly, and finally, democratic control is to be strengthened in future, in that the decision about who is to be made subject to stricter monitoring cannot, any longer, be made by the Commission alone, but by the Council, and subject to reverse qualified majority voting in order to avoid blocking tendencies.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I view as absolutely crucial is that this and other improvements put forward by Parliament in the Gauzès report will not just apply to the Member States in the future, but also to those Member States that are suffering such serious social and economic problems now: Greece, Portugal and Ireland. In that way, Parliament has lived up to its responsibility to implement improvements in the whole context, specifically in the context of what was decided here in controversial, but ultimately successful fashion, namely, the ‘six-pack’.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one last thing I would like to say. It concerns something that actually falls within the scope of the Ferreira report but which is the subject of controversy in Germany at present, namely, the debt redemption pact. If Parliament is to act responsibly in this regard, that means that it must take into consideration the problem of pre-existing debt. It is not enough to respond with arguments that this does not fit strictly within the context. If the Member States do not solve this problem, the euro is heading for extinction. The pre-existing debts need to be resolved, and Parliament therefore must take this proposal forward with a strong majority. I can only call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), in this context, to play their part in the broad support of this amendment by Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the aim of the ‘two-pack’ is to transpose the Fiscal Treaty into secondary law, but instead of reinforcing the logic of the treaty, the ‘two-pack’ reports water it down.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, there is the Gauzès report. After the negotiating process, I am sorry to find only a watered-down version of the ‘golden rule’ that puts the essence of the Fiscal Treaty on a slippery slope. I am happy that another suggestion by Mr Gauzès was retained. He proposes that a Member State at risk of default or suspension of payments should be placed under legal protection. Unfortunately, he did not go one step further by adding that if a Member State is unwilling to surrender its sovereignty in this way, it should be given the option of leaving the eurozone.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was criticised as being irresponsible for tabling an amendment in this sense, but I believe it is the other way round: it is irresponsible not to consider the possibility of a country leaving the eurozone. Mr President, you can choose to ignore reality but reality will not ignore you. Following the Greek elections this weekend, the facts will come to haunt us all.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report by Ms Ferreira goes far beyond the aim of the ‘two-pack’. She confuses EU legislation with the manifesto of her Socialist Party. The rapporteur ties budgetary surveillance to a range of other issues such as eurobonds, a European Redemption Fund, a European Debt Authority, a financial transaction tax and a common consolidated corporate tax base.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a Christmas tree out of season. During negotiations, Mr Gauzès ceded too much to the left, more than many Members of the PPE regarded desirable. In voting, the left mainly abstained regardless.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Ferreira’s report only achieved a small majority. In fact, more Members voted against or abstained than voted in favour. Parliament has produced a wish-list about which it is itself divided. It will not stand in Council and rightly so. The ECR will abstain on Gauzès and vote against Ferreira.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I myself am in favour of economic discipline, but I do not think that the procedure we have adopted is the right way to achieve it. We already have a Growth and Stability Pact; it has been in existence for a long time. We also now have a ‘six-pack’, but we continue to introduce new regulations with the current crisis as a pretext, even though it is now too late to resolve it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">They say that we should learn a lesson from this crisis, but Member States can also learn from it themselves. Finland, for example, suffered a severe recession in the 1990s and learnt a lot from it, and that is why the country is not in such a bad situation now as it was then. They say that there needs to be surveillance from above, but penalties imposed from above will not help. What use is a penalty to a Member State if it is already on the verge of ruin?</p>
      <p sl="fi">This way, we are not rescuing the economy as a priority. There is enough regulation in place. This way, we are building a federation one step at a time, and in this case, two steps at a time. We here have already heard speeches containing visions for the subsequent steps. For my own part, I can no longer vote in favour of even one step towards a federation before we have also asked our citizens if they want one, asked that question specifically in referendums, and received a clear answer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea behind the ‘two-pack’ is to provide further rights of intervention in respect of crisis countries in the euro area. The idea is to give teeth to the European Semester, which was created as a framework to provide better coordination of financial and economic policy. At the Commission’s behest, the Member States are to be forced to accept financial assistance. Through the ‘six-pack’, extensive sanction options that could be imposed on euro area countries with financial problems have already been created. The European Semester has already been perceived by the citizens more as a rollback of democracy than as a useful tool to coordinate economic policy. At the same time, the German Government is openly threatening Greek citizens with being kicked out of the euro area should they make the wrong choice in the elections on Sunday.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why do we not desist from such humiliating and undemocratic chest-beating? In a situation where the euro crisis has dramatically worsened once again – I am thinking of Spain, and of Cyprus – it in no way helps us to pillory Member States that are in crisis. We should at last produce some solutions! The rapporteurs for the ‘two-pack’ have developed some very sensible approaches in this regard. Ms Ferreira made reference to the debt redemption fund, which would be a worthwhile and sensible measure in order to tackle the debts. Mr Gauzès’s proposal for an organised process for national bankruptcy would perhaps also be an option.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is key, however, that Europe should work together and show solidarity in order to set the eurozone back on track for growth. The strong countries in Europe must desist from their self-satisfied finger pointing at their partner countries. They need to begin doing their homework, investing in growth and taking on their responsibilities. A Merkel-style policy of cuts on one side only has simply failed as a model to resolve the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the agreements reached here have time and again proved to be worth nothing because countries have failed to keep to them. Spain appears to have even employed blackmail in order to receive those EUR 100 billion. According to Bloomberg, Spain formulated its threat as follows: ‘If you want to force a bailout for Spain, start preparing EUR 500 billion and another EUR 700 billion for Italy which will have to be bailed out after us’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Is it true, Mr President, that this was said during the negotiations about whether to give EUR 100 billion to Spain? In any case, this explains why Spain will not be placed under the strict supervision of the troika. Prime Minister Rajoy pretty much declared last Sunday, 10 June, a national holiday, because Spain received EUR 100 billion. This is EUR 100 billion of hard-earned cash taken from taxpayers including from those in the Netherlands. What is more, Spain does not even have to meet the strict conditions that Greece, Portugal and Ireland have to meet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question I would like to ask the Commission and the Council about this is as follows: what do you think about the threats that Spain levelled at the Council during the negotiations? How will the Greeks, Portuguese and Irish feel now that Spain is not required to meet the same strict conditions? Can you explain to the Greeks and the Portuguese why Spain is receiving preferential treatment? Can you explain to the Dutch and German taxpayers why Spain has been allowed to get away with years of mismanagement and why it is now being rewarded with EUR 100 billion?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, what do the Commission and the Council think about Spain’s plan to cancel EUR 750 million worth of debt incurred by ailing Spanish football clubs so that Dutch and German taxpayers can bankroll Messi’s and Ronaldo’s multimillion euro salaries?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I have a question for Mr Madlener. He just spoke about adherence to agreements, the 3% budget deficit agreement, among others. However, his own party, which is a member of the ruling Dutch coalition, has been given the opportunity to adhere to these agreements, but his party leader has decided to run away and leave Prime Minister Rutte to sort out the problems.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card answer. – On the contrary, Mr President. The Netherlands has been treated with contempt for years because other countries have failed to stick to the agreements. As a result, the Netherlands now has to pay billions to Spain, Greece and Portugal and is now, therefore, facing financial problems itself.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, it is too absurd for words that these countries have failed to stick to the agreements reached here in the last 10 to 15 years. And now the Netherlands is not sticking to them for the reason that it would be very unwise to implement huge spending cuts and ruin our economy, because the Dutch economy is too important to be frittered away.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the euro crisis is spreading like wildfire and attention is again focused on the hot spots that are still ablaze. This frightens our citizens and I understand that very well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, we have made great progress. We have a fire brigade that had to turn out for the Spanish banks last weekend. More than that, however, we need to try to get the euro house in order structurally. We have made important progress on that front, too, though we are still far from there. It is our task, as well as that of this Parliament as legislator, to contribute vigorously and resolutely to strengthening the foundations of the euro. Our group is in favour of that.</p>

      <p sl="nl">We have made significant steps towards a budgetary and an economic Union; with the ‘six-pack’, the Fiscal Compact, and – Commissioner Rehn is right – the ‘two-pack’, under which the community method is crucial.

This package as a whole is important for the structural solution, for structural recovery of confidence. I hope that tomorrow, a broad majority in this House will be prepared to take responsibility for that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Ms Thyssen is right. This package offers a ‘both together’ scenario, but it is also focused on sustainable growth and jobs with the crucial building blocks.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the growing economic interdependence of the operation of economic and monetary union and the response to the crisis require that we strengthen the economic governance of the European Union. The two regulations that make up this ‘two-pack’ are aimed at promoting budgetary cooperation and preserving the financial stability of countries with serious difficulties or which request or require financial assistance programmes. The rules of economic governance have so far been unbalanced and do not provide sufficient legitimacy. More emphasis has been placed on supervision rather than on cooperation, on sanctions rather than on incentives, and on the intergovernmental method rather than on the community method.</p>
      <p sl="es">This approach has proved to be ineffective. This package should rebalance it. It should rebalance it and bring efficiency to it, as well as legitimacy, thus promoting cooperation, fostering a focus on growth and employment, and ensuring greater democratic involvement. That is the intention of the amendments presented in the package.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the Ferreira report makes significant progress. This is because it introduces a mandate with a road map towards eurobonds, establishing a sustainable growth instrument in the euro area – including an increase in European Investment Bank capital and bonds for projects – and the creation of a redemption fund that must be applied without discrimination. I believe that the mandate should also incorporate and identify the investments required in order to fulfil the Europe 2020 strategy, because if we want fiscal discipline, we have to talk about quality of spending.</p>
      <p sl="es">It also needs to be pointed out that these reports have strengthened the effects of the economic policies of one Member State on the other Member States and the protection of fiscal income. They have also introduced the social clause and consider the role of social partners and civil society. In my view, what is missing is the role of Parliament. When there are Member States, as in the case of Spain, that have asked for the assistance programme, which are therefore going to be subject to increased supervision, I think there is a need to ensure democratic control so that its people are completely aware of the conditions being imposed on them and how the burden is being distributed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, it is a pity that Mr Karas is no longer in the chair as this morning’s debate reminds me of a certain characteristic of the Austrian sense of humour. The Austrian author, Paul Watzlawick, said: ‘Die Lage ist hoffnungslos aber nicht ernst ’, which means: the situation is desperate, but it is not serious’. I get the impression that the general approach here entails talking about how desperate the situation is but, at the same time, not taking seriously the need for immediate measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I would like to praise the Commission for its efforts and its willingness to improve the proposed legislation, and our rapporteurs for the work they have done on improving them. I myself was a supporter of the ‘six-pack’ and therefore agree completely that we should be moving in the direction of discipline and structural reform. However, we believe that what is needed now is urgent reform and crisis management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we believe that the most important point in both these pieces of legislation is the proposal for a redemption fund. The name is odd, but the point is that we need a fund that would reduce the pressure, as I have said before and will say again, especially to certain of my fellow Members, on countries that are implementing structural reforms, reforming their budgetary discipline and still having to cope with interest rates that are becoming unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Discipline is based on the markets. It can only work if the markets themselves reflect the real situation. At present, however, there is an unhealthy, untenable discrepancy between some countries that, in my opinion, are being unjustly punished, and others that are probably being unjustly favoured. The cohesion of the Union between European countries is at stake. That is why I call on all Members to vote in favour of the redemption fund.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these two regulations are much needed. They provide a legal basis for work that the Commission, in fact, is already doing, when it takes part in the troika in countries that are, as we say, ‘under a programme’, or when it works with Member States in the context of their budgetary procedures. I think it is better to work within a legal framework than outside one and, in that respect, these two regulations are needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I must highlight the fact that the rapporteurs have really worked in a spirit of inclusiveness, and I hope that will be demonstrated by an overwhelming vote in favour tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should now like to reply particularly to Ms Thyssen, perhaps. Yes, it is true that we need sustainable public finances. We cannot build ourselves a future on deficits and debt. That is very clear. There should be no doubt about that. That is what was said in the ‘six-pack’ and it is being said again in the ‘two-pack’, but it cannot be the be-all and end-all of our policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In other words, what we also need – in addition to that and not instead of it, of course – is a way to mutualise the debt that allows us to have interest rates that make the debt sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even more importantly, we also need fiscal convergence to ensure not only that spending is sustainable, but also that revenues are sufficient to cover this spending.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we need to invest, invest and invest again so we can restructure our economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, Ms Thyssen, is what we wanted to introduce with the ‘two-pack’. Rome was not built in a day, of course, but even so we cannot keep saying that discipline is what we need right now and everything else will follow on later. We have to put rules of budgetary discipline in place today – and, in fact, they were brought in a year ago now. We have to start putting debt mutualisation in place today. We have to start putting fiscal convergence in place today. We should already have started investing in our future yesterday. We cannot, therefore, keep on saying we want discipline right away and everything else will follow on eventually.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Telling us that we are trying to bring it in through the back door is nonsense! These measures have been needed for two years, and we have not yet begun to put them into practice. That is why I should like us to make a start.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I should like to reply to those who say that all that will cost the net contributor countries money. I should like to remind them, actually, that today the net contributor countries – and my country is one of them – ‘lend’ money and do not ‘give’ it. They receive interest on these loans, and I would add that countries such as Germany now have investors pay them to invest their money. Their interest rates are negative. Bremer Landesbank reckons that Germany now benefits to the tune of EUR 45-65 billion. That is immediate profit, so the cost to Germany would only be a cost if some of the loans taken out were not repaid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, please stop saying that we are bleeding ourselves dry for all those people in southern Europe. At the moment, it is a lucrative process for the net contributor countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, over the past two years, as the different measures to solve the eurozone crisis have been decided, the legislation required to implement them has been struggling to catch up.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ‘two-pack’ should do just that: adding the secondary legislation to implement the decisions that were made by the eurozone Member States when they demanded monetary missions to Greece and others as a condition of financial assistance. We need to proceed quickly, as events continue to unfold in individual Member States, and we should not extend the scope.</p>
      <p sl="en">The framework being put in place rightly allows for the different treatment that Spain will receive, separating out the concept of recapitalisation of banks from a macro-economic adjustment plan. Yet I have some concerns for those countries which were bailed out earlier and have not been given the benefit of this special treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the details emerge of precisely what terms the Spanish Government has managed to secure for its banking bailout, the principle of equal treatment must be followed. If a lower interest rate is justified for Spain, it must also be considered retrospectively for Ireland and its banking bailout. Equality in implementation will show true solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again, debating new measures just a few months after approving similar legislation. It is like watching a continuous chase to try to recover a situation that has now become almost desperate. I do not believe that we can resolve this tragic situation the euro area has got itself into by putting straitjackets on Member States or even by proposing legal protections.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we want to keep economic and monetary union alive, we must also find tools for growth, such as eurobonds, or some form of measures that will encourage investment. The euro has brought benefits to the few and huge problems to many. Some Member States, such as Germany, should understand this situation better and accept some compromises, as other countries have done in the past. If this does not happen, economic and monetary union may also end here, and we would definitely not have many regrets. Indeed, Germany itself may end up being the country most affected.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the proposals we are discussing here today confirm that policies for stabilising the euro area are prohibited and they further establish the logic of the Budgetary Treaty. There have been some declarations of intent, but they are very timid. I am referring, for example, to the road map towards a day when we can begin to think of ways to establish possible legislation for the hypothetical introduction of eurobonds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The problem is that this day will only arrive when all of the euro area’s problems have been resolved and it will then be too late, far too late. We support some aspects of this proposal but, at this rate, it will all be too little, too late. To put a country under legal protection implies maintaining rates and amounts, and giving new loans priority. That is, it requires the Member States to honour their debt, but removes from them all of the instruments they could use to ensure growth and to find the resources they need to do so.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us be frank with one another: the only legal protection that exists in these proposals, and which is planned, is for the creditors, but even this will not be achieved because it is not even effective for them. As we have seen in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and now Spain, this means condemning the countries to recession, unemployment and insolvency. Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying that the deterioration of these situations and their spreading to other economies is bringing us close to the point of no return. Given the failure of complete austerity, the Commission and the German Government propose the same policy to us, but in overdose. It is this neoliberal fanaticism that is killing the euro.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the two regulations on the table aim to give the Commission greater powers to scrutinise national budgets and economic policies. The rules will be stricter and failing Member States will have budget cuts and structural reforms forced on them by the Brussels technocrats to redress their financial balance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This stronger surveillance is called ‘bailing them out’. Member States will be punished or fined – given a caning, one might say.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European model for economic and monetary union is based on the central monetary policy of the European Central Bank and the decentralised budgetary and finance policies of the Member States. The Member States have failed because they did not live up to their commitments – and the same applies to the Commission, which failed to monitor the same.</p>
      <p sl="de">The financial markets have forced Europe to put in place diverse solidarity measures, namely, the European Semester, the ‘six-pack’, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and European supervision. However, nobody can relieve the nation states, their parliaments and governments of their responsibility. The communitarisation of debt fosters sloppiness and not solidarity, penalises those with higher taxes and interest rates, those who are competitive and who have done what they were supposed to do in accordance with treaty commitments. eurobonds, a debt redemption fund, blue bonds or red bonds are a mistake, as well as being expressly prohibited under Article 125 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Without treaty changes, they are impermissible. Commissioner Rehn has said that proposals will be on the table as soon as tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to the responsibility of the Commission, I would like to conclude with a quotation from the former chief economist of the European Central Bank, Otmar Issing, who said, ‘How can we expect objective and effective supervision from the European Commission when it is an institution that itself repeatedly participates in initiatives that violate the Treaties or covers up problems, rendering their resolution more expensive?’</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, this debate on the two new regulations is being held, as we all know, at a critical juncture for Europe, for the future of the European plan and for the future of the euro, and at a critical juncture for certain Member States of the euro area already applying adjustment programmes, including, in particular, Greece, due to the very crucial elections to be held next Sunday. These two regulations cover, first and foremost, a very important institutional loophole, because the lack of common European rules in adjustment programme planning and evaluation to date has resulted, in certain cases, in dogmatic, inflexible approaches, which are blind to the current economic and financial situation, that make targets, if not unattainable, then very difficult to attain, and which ultimately, in conjunction with certain internal weaknesses and omissions, damage the very credibility of the adjustment programme and its chances of success.</p>
      <p sl="el">In light of this, I wish to extend my especial thanks to the two rapporteurs, Jean-Paul Gauzès and Elisa Ferreira, because the compromise reached in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs introduces certain such basic rules, which are currently absent from the adjustment programmes being applied – at least they are absent from the Greek adjustment programme – and which relate, for example, to the facility to modify the programme, taking account of negative secondary consequences and macro-economic and financial disruptions. I also wish to mention the Monti clause on the need to respect the rules and practices governing working relations in the Union and, of course, the obligations of the State within the framework of the strategy for growth and jobs. At this very critical juncture for my country and Europe, the European Parliament’s proposals flesh out the concept of solidarity and are the best response to the populism and accusations that Greek citizens will face in next Sunday’s elections.</p>

That was our experience in Sweden during the 1990s: it was not a matter of austerity for austerity’s sake; it was a matter of providing the opportunity for growth, and I believe that this is a good proposal that will give Europe that opportunity.</p>

In other words, we want greater discipline. At the same time, we are going to vote in favour of the ‘two-pack’ because we consider it the ideal addition to what used to be the ‘six-pack’.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Fiscal Compact has, however, not yet been ratified in many Member States. It has not been ratified in Italy, it has not been ratified in Germany, and it has not been ratified in France. In order to be ratified by a qualified majority, a compromise will be needed. We will therefore vote in favour of the report by Mr Gauzès and also the report by Ms Ferreira because we believe that only a compromise can create the conditions whereby we might have sufficient majorities in our countries to ratify the Fiscal Compact. We are going to vote in favour, and our approval also covers the redemption fund and unbundling of investments.</p>
      <p sl="it">These are our reasons. They are the justifications for a vision which clearly understands that, at the heart of Europe, there is, first and foremost, a concern for peace and development, and that, through compromises, political families shall ensure that discipline and development are available to all.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘two-pack’ shows that there is a legal basis for EU governance of the euro area, as this Chamber had called for during the revision of Article 136.</p>
      <p sl="it">What we now have to assess is whether these two regulations seem to be capable of dealing with the deterioration of the crisis and the potential of their legal basis. Here, the answer is clear: the Commission’s proposal seems to belong to another epoch. As Commissioner Rehn has said, the Commission proposes an addition to the ‘six-pack’ without taking into account the obvious limits of austerity policies and economic governance that are solely focused on introducing rigid constraints and without attributing any real financial decision-making powers to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has introduced significant improvements to the Commission’s proposal, especially visible in the report by Ms Ferreira, first and foremost, in the article on the debt redemption fund. However, there remain several limitations. I am struck by the deafness of rapporteur Mr Gauzès who, faced with the proposal to involve Parliament in activating the enhanced surveillance procedure, introduces a procedure similar to that used for delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our group, however, has responsibly decided to focus on one point, on which, however, there still appears to be some confusion. Amendment 82 is not a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not a classic ‘golden rule’ clause. Quite the opposite: it is a tool to defend the Stability and Growth Pact, to make it effective and to ensure compliance, as well as giving a greater role to the Commission. The amendment is based on the concept of sustainable discipline and gives the Commission the task of prioritising investments for growth and employment when defining medium-term objectives and assessing Member State budgets.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, I call upon fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to read the amendment, to reflect and to prevent this Parliament from appearing to be cut off from a situation that is evolving throughout Europe as well as in the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis goes on. The measures adopted in recent months, or even years, have failed to convince the markets on a durable basis. There is an urgent need for the Member States to take seriously a disciplined, balanced budgetary policy. The ‘two-pack’ can help to make progress in that direction. It can provide the basis for stability and growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, a whole series of amendments are once again being tabled, with the aim of watering down the proposals. We do not need a watered-down ‘two-pack’, however. What we do require is a genuine act of release. This act of release could consist of two elements. The first element would be the debt redemption fund already mentioned by a number of speakers, which would help to consolidate the inherited debts and spread them out over a period of 25 years. The second element would be that we have to achieve real progress in the conversion of the euro area into a true internal financial market, in other words, into an internal market with cross-border banking supervision, a cross-border deposit guarantee fund and a uniform cross-border banking rescue and resolution regime.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the global crisis has had an adverse impact on the global economy for over three years now and it is, unfortunately, the European economy that has suffered the most. The crisis has caused significant disruption to basic economic growth and financial stability. As we all know, excessive debt can have dramatic consequences, and not only for the country concerned, but for entire regions, in this instance, the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that we should give consideration to an honest assessment of whether it is not just the reputation of the euro area which is at threat, but its very existence. The EU was taken by surprise by a scenario far bleaker than that for which it was prepared. It did not have the necessary tools at its disposal. Will this now change after the adoption of the ‘six-pack’ and the addition of the ‘two-pack’? We shall see. In my opinion, it is plain as day that anyone who builds a house by starting with the roof, and not by choosing a patch of solid ground and building the foundations, cannot expect the outcome to be good. The rapporteur supports the Commission’s proposal to step up surveillance and to take early preventive measures instead of corrective action when it is already too late. Will this be enough? We shall see, but I doubt it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to begin by noting that Parliament has been discussing this ‘two-pack’ for approximately six months. We are now entering a phase of trialogues and I ask that this work be conducted quickly. I am aware that this has always been the aim of the most involved members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We urgently need responses to the challenges we are currently facing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Jean-Paul Gauzès and Elisa Ferreira, for the work they have done on this ‘two-pack’. With the ‘six-pack’, it could form an ‘eight-pack’ solution. Parliament helped to bring this about for this crisis. The solution is based on the following premise: there will only be sustainable growth with disciplined public finance. This is the starting point for the future challenges we are facing, the challenge of growth. Growth naturally requires political stability, social stability and European solutions. Some of these are extremely urgent; some face difficulties. We will have to amend the Treaties if we are to have a system of eurobonds. We need the will of the Member States if we are to have a redemption fund and for these things to appear as soon as possible. Once again, everything depends on time and a European solution. Shortly, we will advocate a European solution for Schengen. On this matter, we must also advocate a European solution and support the great efforts the Commission has made in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Ms Vestager, Mr Rehn, with these two reports, I think the important message that Parliament can bring to your work is that we must begin to improve consistency, since we can plainly see that the crisis we are sinking into, or have already sunk into, requires us to be perhaps a little more consistent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot demand a lot from certain Member States and, at the same time, give nothing back, and we cannot wait until the end of the whole affair to reward them for their efforts. It is entirely a matter of governance – modern, intelligent governance adapted to the reality and severity of the crisis facing us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To achieve this consistency, when we draw up our economic policies, we must bear in mind everything we have learnt and everything we know about the extent of the macro-economic imbalances and the need to correct them. That means that the policies introduced must be evaluated, in terms of timing and criteria, according to how well they address these macro-economic imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, Ms Vestager, the banking union question will clearly be at the heart of the discussions at the European Council on 28 and 29 June. The message I think this Parliament can give there, particularly with Ms Ferreira’s report, is one of balance. There must be a balance between a new approach in the Council debate to the challenges of growth, of which we are one of the main axes in Ms Ferreira’s report – which I hope will be given considerable support by this Chamber – and managing the debt issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This balance between the way the debt question is addressed and the need for real growth – not merely internal market liberalisation but, above all, growth aiming at the long term and at investment – will at last enable us to give Europeans new hope.</p>

      <p sl="en">The solution is not inventing new institutions or inventing new funds for new spending; it is making reforms in all Member States, something we have known for a number of years. We need to act together and we need to have common rules.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the ‘two-pack’ applies to France, as it does to most countries in the euro area. France, however, has just issued its latest government bonds at historically low rates. It has to get its economy growing again so as to reduce its deficits and continue to benefit from such rates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To that end, Ms Ferreira raises the possibility of proactive investment policies by proposing, like Mario Monti, to change the way deficits are calculated so as to distinguish the role of public investment. She also supports the creation of eurobonds, which are needed to curb speculation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the future of the euro is at stake, the conservatives would be taking on a serious responsibility if they rejected the amendments and compromises, including these two proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the Gauzès report, by generalising the reversed qualified majority principle, it places all the power in the hands of the Commission, whose recommendations are particularly controversial not only in Greece but also in France and elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Gauzès report represents a first step towards European insolvency law, which is a prerequisite for fiscal union. Fiscal union, in turn, is a prerequisite for the implementation of political union. If we do not Europeanise budget policy, we cannot conduct a stability-oriented monetary policy. With these two reports we have, on the one hand, stronger surveillance and protection against national bankruptcy and, on the other, the monitoring of budgetary plans and a stronger right of intervention on the part of the Commission. It is a step in the right direction; things just always take quite a long time here. Let us continue in this direction since debt reduction alone will still not bring about the resolution of our crisis.</p>

There is agreement within the Chamber that the Member States must significantly reduce their deficit and debt. In this context, I urge the Commission to be more vigilant so as to ensure that the benchmarks are respected and are not marginalised by some innovative public expenses instrument.</p>
      <p sl="mt">At the same time, we have seen that all austerity programmes implemented by any Member State in the past two years, be it rich or poor, has thrown these countries into recession. Even the average citizen is pointing fingers at us and asking us why this is being done. We cannot put off tackling our biggest economic problem any longer. It is costing billions of euro in revenue losses, aside from the fact that unemployment, especially among the younger generation, is morally wrong.</p>
      <p sl="mt">My national party has proposed a guarantee that will grant every young person the right to be in school, training or work. Measures such as these, as well as business incentives that employ young people, are desired.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate is yet another debate and yet another step on the way back to re-implementing the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is always a difficult debate in the European Parliament, and those of us who remember the debate on the ‘six-pack’ – and that is surely all of us – will know how difficult it was to reach an agreement on the issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, we are talking about enhanced surveillance of Member States to which assistance will ultimately be granted or is already being granted, and monitoring of the budgetary plans of the Member States. Everyone seems to agree in theory with the Commission’s proposals as regards the need for monitoring and surveillance of Member States which receive financial assistance, so this debate has focused on the precise nature of the criteria – should we use strict criteria to monitor, or, in other words, the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact, or should we relax the criteria?</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to remind the House that we are talking about reducing the debt of the Member States in the euro area, and not about increasing debt. I have the impression after listening to this debate that some Members are suggesting we should grant assistance and monitor it, but not put in place any criteria to ensure that it has a real impact. I would like to remind everyone that the objectives have been the same for a long time and that they have not changed. The question is the extent to which they should be implemented. The objective is 3%, and it will never change, but it is not new either; it is an objective we have had in place for a long time, but which has not been put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My final comment relates to the debt redemption fund. We often make the point in this Chamber that some banks use clever tricks to sell money which does not exist. I am afraid that the idea behind this fund is a trick, and it reminds me of the kind of trick which boils down to pretending there is no debt when, in fact, there still is.</p>

      <p sl="sv">During the crisis, the Commission has committed a number of infringements. By means of extortion-like demands, minimum wages have been reduced, the structure of collective agreements has been dismantled and trade unions have been excluded from the negotiations. We can see that the labour market has been damaged, particularly in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. We must put an end to these nasty habits.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am not underestimating the importance of the economic choices that we have to make, but please allow me to focus on a rather more political point in this debate. Over recent weeks, we have once again heard evidence of the doublespeak used by certain top European leaders or would-be top leaders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Though they are all incessantly calling for proper coordination of our economic, budgetary and fiscal policies, and this requirement even seems to be a sine qua non for the euro area to survive, once they are comfortably back at home, they consider it smart to criticise the well-balanced recommendations issued by the Commission, to go back on certain commitments or, worst of all, to stir up public opinion against these Brussels diktats, as they call them. Their irresponsible attitude would be laughable if we were not in such a terrible situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I tell you straight: our debates on stability, the necessary stabilisation of public finances or the work to be done to secure growth will be well and truly doomed to failure if the bad old habits of debt and public deficits are not done away with and if the Member States’ governments persist with their nonchalant attitude. Right now, we are playing with fire. European discipline has to apply to everyone without exception, including even the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. That demands a certain amount of courage, and public opinion in our countries is ready for it, even more so than some of their leaders would like to think.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should concentrate on today’s subject, and forget about things that are off topic. What are we discussing today? We are discussing how we want to bring Parliament and the Member States together in order to establish strict ground rules that will not go the way of all things European, which is to say that, while they may be adopted here, when it comes to application, they no longer play a major role, as we have already experienced in many, many cases – not only with the euro, but elsewhere, too. We want to establish ground rules that really oblige the Member States to do things that are urgently necessary, in order to guarantee that which states were originally created to provide, namely, guaranteeing infrastructure, education, employment, social security and many other things for the people, although not at the expense of future generations or other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should therefore not do the other thing proposed in numerous amendments, which is to say, we should not accompany this obligation with the development of any new sources of funding that have only one purpose, namely, to reward those who have not kept to the rules hitherto and punish those who have.</p>
      <p sl="de">A Europe on that basis will not work in the long term. Europe will only work if everyone adheres to the ground rules agreed. The idea of a debt redemption fund must therefore be rejected. Such a fund punishes those who kept their houses in order, to the benefit of those who did not. The idea of eurobonds must therefore be rejected. Such bonds punish those who acted properly and adhered to the rules and reward those who did not. These sections should therefore be rejected.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we fully agree on the need to stress the importance of sound and rigorous fiscal policies and we also agree on the preventive monitoring of budgets, which will allow EU institutions to monitor and to act in a timely and appropriate manner where a Member State fails to comply with the parameters. On these policies, we are in full agreement. In this way, we would be acting ex post – as the EU has failed to do in this crisis – on sovereign debt. We are therefore in agreement on these policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">We will also be sending out a clear signal that the speculation occurring – which is an international phenomenon – must be curbed. We do need a system of effective regulations. That said, this system of rules must be combined with measures to support growth and development that act on both demand and supply. On this point, I think we are duty bound to hold a debate. These are two parallel axes which can and must intersect. We must therefore put growth at the centre by implementing effective and efficient measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">In today’s debate, we must also not forget the political facts, because otherwise, we run the risk of simply kidding ourselves.

It is true that there is a difference between 3% and 0.5% inside and outside the euro area, but if the legislation fails to lay down by how much euro area Member States can exceed and go beyond the limit with the growth incentive package, then this means that Member States outside the euro area lack this option, while those within the euro area can reach higher deficits.

In truth, there is nothing that holds economies down more than sovereign debt – it holds back growth and cuts us off from the possibility of incentives for development and growth for years.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, today we are returning to discussions on the objective of adopting appropriate measures at European Union level to facilitate the coordination and surveillance of Member States’ budgetary and economic policies.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Last year, we adopted a document with six pieces of legislation, which attempted to tighten the policies of certain countries, but today it is clear that in order to maintain economic stability, not just in the euro area but beyond, this is not enough. We therefore have to concentrate not just on strict austerity measures, as many have said here, but we need to seek other solutions that would allow us to anticipate economic recovery and the creation of new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We should therefore expect these two pieces of legislation to really solve this problem and, in future, we can expect greater integration among all Member States, in terms of budget approval and the economic compatibility of our actions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, European games are topical at the moment. While Heads of State attend football games as they make important economic decisions for our citizens, we are left on the sidelines. It is therefore necessary to support European measures to combat the euro area crisis, a crisis that affects our citizens, in the form of severe cutbacks, particularly in the Member States with the greatest economic difficulties and the highest unemployment rates.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I agree with Ms Ferreira in that the policies that undermine solidarity break with the EU road map, but we cannot build a constructive future on a foundation of debt and a paradigm of budgetary discipline. For example, where is the democratic control and the legitimacy in the scandalous rescue of the Spanish Government, where the sole beneficiary is a private bank? Is this an example of the European game we want to play to combat the euro area crisis?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in Commissioner Rehn’s opening remarks, he declared his ‘deep respect for the principles of democratic scrutiny’. I have to ask him whether there is a room inside the Commission where he can leave that deep respect while he gets on with his work, because the reality is that the Commission, in collaboration with the establishment political parties across Europe, have displayed a deep contempt for any democratic rights throughout the course of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the ‘six-pack’, with the austerity treaty and now with the ‘two-pack’, the basic democratic right of elected governments to decide on economic and budgetary policy has been undermined.</p>
      <p sl="en">As always in these institutions, this is shrouded in euphemisms that are largely the ‘defence of the indefensible’, as George Orwell said. So let me remove the veil of euphemism. The enhanced surveillance being referred to here means the placing of governments into administration, it provides a legal basis for the semi-colony status of many countries now within the European Union, it means the further technocratisation of economic policy and includes a mechanism to force countries into austerity programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is all a means for the Commission to employ yet more failed austerity policies – failed from the point of view of the millions, but which work from the point of views of the multimillionaires whom the Commission and the establishment parties represent.</p>

Mr President, by what right is the European Parliament deliberating over the implementation of measures that the Treaty of Lisbon explicitly prohibits?

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been listening to the debate all morning, and the watchwords have been discipline, rigour, governance, controls, monitoring, stability, coordination, convergence, ‘six-pack’, ‘two-pack’ and Fiscal Compact. All our reasoning is focused on stability. I believe – and all of us know – that the European house is burning. Social tension in our countries is skyrocketing, amid humiliations and suicides.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is now time to clarify what we mean by growth. Growth is work and an increase in GDP, and it is up to us to say when and how. I believe that if this does not happen immediately, it will not even be possible to comply with the commitments we have made, given everything we have decided so far in the Fiscal Compact. Mr President, I have just one question: how can a country reduce its debt and get to 60% in 20 years in an economic downturn?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, one of the headlines in today’s news from Finland, for example, is that the euro crisis is drawing the country into recession. In the international news, there is talk about how the recession-hit euro area is inhibiting global growth. I think that these headlines should be linked to the notion that we are actually all in the same boat. In the debate, there are no good or bad countries or countries that have mismanaged their affairs: at the moment, we are all in the same boat.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In my view, both the country holding the Presidency and the Commission deserve our respect, in view of the fact that so much has happened. If we mention everything that has happened – regulation, the Rescue Mechanism, the Systemic Risk Board, and so on – together, it is quite a major achievement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">However, one thing is missing, and so everything is missing. What is missing is a vision of the direction that Europe is taking, and that is why voters are angry, markets are nervous and our global partners do not really know where Europe wants to go. For this reason, the next summit will be very important, as will the Commission’s new road map, in making people more aware of what Europe actually wants. The responsible European political parties should create this vision too.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, who is at fault in the matter of sovereign debt? By any logic, in the current circumstances, it is all those Member States whose debt is larger than 60% of their GDP. Anything above 60% is therefore unauthorised debt. Yet the markets punish some and reward others. Even though their debt is above 60%, some pay 5% while others pay nothing or 1%.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am in favour of mutualising the unauthorised part of the debt. In the environmental field, the ‘polluter pays’ principle would be applied. Transposing this principle to the field of budgetary policy in the euro area is the equivalent of mutualising this part of the debt.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, firstly, it is important to say that this initiative suffers from a serious legal problem. It is assumed that an attempt will be made to include the content of the Fiscal Compact in EU secondary legislation. The small problem we find with this is that the Fiscal Compact has not been ratified, nor does it come within EU fundamental law because it is an intergovernmental treaty. This shows that the Commission’s objectives, supported by the majority of this Parliament, are to be imposed on citizens by any means possible, even if they lack legal legitimacy. Is this the European citizenship that the Commission says it wishes to promote? Secondly, it is important to highlight that, as much as the text tries to hide it with words about growth and employment, the measures strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance are nothing more than an enhancement of the Stability and Growth Pact and the eternal institutionalisation of the so-called austerity measures, restricting the budgetary and economic sovereignty of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What are referred to here as macro-economic adjustment programmes are no different from so-called austerity measures. That is, they drive forward the formula of cutting public social services and social security systems, and reducing employment unit costs by reducing salaries and employment rights.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the situation created by the rescue package is very concerning. The Spanish people are not being told the whole truth about the new debt that the Spanish Government and State are taking on as a public debt to support the private debt. The Spanish Government has asked for aid that it previously said it did not want, and it is presenting it ridiculously as a triumph, as a fellow Member has said during this debate. This is not a triumph, but a failure by Bankia and others.</p>
      <p sl="es">I stress here that there is no policy that is right for Europe other than that fostered by the French Government, behind which we need to close parliamentary ranks, as we will not come out of the debt crisis without harmonised growth for everyone. We do, of course, need all the necessary supervision, as stated in the two reports, but simultaneous, anti-speculative growth is essential, as mentioned in some of the measures in both reports and also in other reports. I ask for clarity and transparency, as well as balance, as my colleague Mr Sánchez Presedo said.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is not the business of the EU to give instructions to Member States on their budgets, even if the instructions were wise and the Member States foolish.</p>

However, that does not mean that austerity measures are the answer. Putting the populations of debtor countries out of employment will not help them to get out of debt. Advice for countries to be frugal should be addressed to them before they get into debt and not when they are heavily indebted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is the answer to borrow even more so they can engage in Keynesian expansionism? My advice would be that quantitative easing would be preferable to credit creation and borrowing. However, full payment should be delayed until any resulting production has emerged in goods and services, in order to avoid inflation.</p>
      <p sl="en">But reversion to devalued domestic currency would itself produce export-led growth. That would generate government revenue and reduce debt.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank you for a very substantive and serious debate. I think that you share the sense of urgency and determination to pursue our joint strategy for sustainable growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">These two draft regulations are indeed very important parts of that strategy in order to address macro-economic imbalances pre-emptively and in order to restore the sustainability of public finances, which is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and employment. Let me comment on two or three key policy issues in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, with a view to the European Council in mid-June, we need to define the main steps towards full economic union. In that context, our guiding principle should be that, in order to move to further mutualisation, it is necessary in parallel to further strengthen our stability culture. That means, when talking about the prospect of a fiscal union, that more mutualisation of sovereign risk necessarily requires more fiscal integration before it can be acceptable to all. Moreover, more fiscal integration requires more pooling of fiscal sovereignty and that calls for a very profound debate on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">One important avenue to strengthen economic and monetary union (EMU) is to construct a financial union as an essential element of a real and genuine EMU. The main building blocks towards a financial union could include at least larger banks of systemic importance for macro-financial stability in Europe and its regions. It will call for a solid EU euro area compact, including strengthened financial supervision at European level, a resolution authority at European euro area level and a single deposit guarantee scheme at European euro area level – all these in the same arrangement covering at least the euro area’s larger financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The basic point here is the same as on the fiscal side: the sharing of risk in the guarantee scheme calls for substantially reinforced regulation and supervision at the relevant euro area or European level. In other words, any step in the further sharing of risk can only be taken on the condition that it is balanced by provisions to avoid free riding on the consolidation efforts of other Member States. This applies also to fiscal integration; for instance, the proposal of a debt redemption pact by the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers is no different.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is often referred to as a debt redemption fund but that is only part of it; it is a pact which has two sides. This debt redemption pact proposal would balance the suggested mutualisation of debt with very strict fiscal rules for the participating Member States for a very large number of years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why is that? In order to make it rational for all participants to agree to further risk sharing, enhanced economic surveillance must ensure fiscal prudence and minimise moral hazard, which again will require a very fundamental debate about pooling of fiscal sovereignty. This principle applies to the prospective construction of both financial and fiscal union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I shall make some statements on Spain as well, as I find it is a very important subject at this critical juncture. Following the Euro Group’s positive response to Spain’s announcement that it is opting for support from the euro area for the restructuring of its financial sector, the Commission is ready to proceed swiftly with the necessary assessment on the ground, in close alliance with the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and the International Monetary Fund, and subsequently to propose appropriate conditionality for the financial sector in Spain. This means that system-wide and financial framework conditionality will include specific recommendations concerning financial sector supervision and regulatory requirements. In addition, bank-specific conditionality subject to State aid rules would be applied exclusively to the banks benefiting from the EFSF/ESM assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this thorough restructuring of the banking sector in Spain, together with the ongoing determined implementation of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, Spain can gradually regain confidence and create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth and job creation. The only objective – and let me underline this – of this euro area decision, which the Commission supports, is to protect the savings of ordinary Spaniards and to enable credit flows to productive enterprises and ordinary households in Spain. This is indeed crucial for returning to recovery and for sustainable growth and job creation which, of course, is our ultimate objective. It is important also for the whole of Europe because this is also being done in order to safeguard financial stability in Europe as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, first of all, I would like to offer my thanks for a debate that has been particularly wide-ranging, and that reflects the seriousness that any political leadership must have in light of the current situation in Europe. Many different points have been made, including in relation to how absolutely crucial it is to unify the attempts to again create trust in public budgets and, at the same time, create growth and jobs in European Member States.</p>
      <p sl="da">I have listened with great interest to the many different contributions this morning. Unfortunately, in the time available, I cannot answer every point raised, but there will be an opportunity to exchange even more highly detailed proposals when we start the trialogue process. There is one comment I have to make though, which is that one of the things that is absolutely crucial is to regain trust in the political leadership, both in Europe and in every individual Member State. There is no way to achieve that trust via crushing debt. Similarly, there is no way to achieve that trust via budgets to which we fail to adhere. Quite simply, it is absolutely crucial that we should see sustainable public budgets and a consolidation of our budgets as a prerequisite for growth, rather than as a brake on it.</p>
      <p sl="da">A strong focus on getting control over the money we use goes hand in hand with our focus on growth. It is crucial to create trust in the markets from our side, but also for the markets to hear what is said and react to what is decided. We have before us two sound, decent proposals that help to complete the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact that the Commission, the Council and Parliament very earnestly managed to get implemented. I hope that it will be possible to achieve rapid progress and thus also reach agreement. It is important that we should show that, when it comes to fundamental elements such as sticking to budgetary plans and ensuring adequately robust monitoring of whether deficits are too large, we are willing to find the compromises. It is therefore now that we can show that the community method also works when Europe is in crisis – that we can deliver another crucial contribution to strengthening our economic governance of the conditions that are important in order to exit the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for stressing the necessity of negotiating and getting the trialogue under way quickly. It is important to obtain an agreement, because once we have an agreement, we will be helping to create balance between the responsibility of each individual Member State – which they have been given by their electorates – to manage the economy and get back to the path of growth, and a European dimension, which is inescapable in order to create growth and trust once again. From the Presidency’s side, we look forward to getting the trialogue under way. The debate today has been an important prerequisite and we hope that the vote tomorrow will provide a sound basis for the trialogue to begin as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as time is extremely limited, all I would like to say to the Commission right now is that, as usual, it can count on this Parliament to work efficiently to strengthen the euro area and Europe. However, this will only be achieved if, in addition to the initiatives that focus on discipline, we can add the stipulations of equitably sharing the gains and sacrifices between the different Member States and between our citizens, as well as a sense of hope, the hope that there will be an end to the crisis we are going through. For this hope to be real, we need other initiatives which this Parliament is trying to introduce: initiatives geared towards investment, growth and controlling sovereign debt, which is the obvious Achilles heel and reflects the weakness of the economic systems of some of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, you can count on us. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you can count on us. However, the agenda has to be inclusive. The agenda cannot stipulate that discipline comes before all else, nor can it make discipline the be-all and end-all of our EU proposals. Our citizens expect this from us. They can count on Parliament. I would again like to thank our colleagues, the rapporteurs, Mr Gauzès, who is the other rapporteur, and all of the colleagues who, as shadow-rapporteurs or simply active participants in putting the project together, helped to make Parliament’s project more balanced, more solid, and one which I hope will be deserving of respect and warrant discussion in the same constructive and committed spirit we have seen so far.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The solutions proposed today in the resolution on the MFF are a key step in the fight against the crisis in Europe. The need to limit expenditure is a key issue currently affecting the budgets of the EU’s Member States. The mechanisms included in this ‘two-pack’ – budgetary surveillance by the European Commission in cooperation with the national parliaments – will facilitate budgetary consolidation and allow particular surveillance of countries with excessive budget deficits. This solution will give the EU institutions more influence over the budgetary policies of the Member States, without infringing on democratic procedures. The draft also covers measures aimed at stimulating economic growth. Cuts alone will not be enough to put the economy back on the right track and, what is more, it will be the average citizen who is hit hardest. The draft obliges the Commission and the Member States to adopt solutions which will not stifle either economic growth or investment, particularly in the fields of education and the health service.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must also take steps in the near future to increase the EU’s budget. We will be able to allocate income from eurobonds or a financial transaction tax, for example, to investment and job creation. Balanced economic growth and budgetary discipline are not mutually exclusive, and Poland provides a good example of this. Thanks to amendments made to the constitution in 1997 imposing budgetary restrictions, even now, the country can still boast GDP growth of almost 4%. The resolution on the MFF will mark the start of a new era of high-quality public finances in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Adoption of the so-called ‘two-pack’ is an important step towards strengthening the economic governance framework within the euro area. The ‘six-pack’, complemented by the ‘two-pack’, is the badly needed ‘medicine’ to achieve further economic growth, financial stability and stronger budgetary discipline. Unfortunately, now we are learning the hard way about the dramatic effects of Member States’ excessive debt. The ‘two-pack’ is needed in order to put in place the legal framework for the work the European Commission is already performing as it is closely linked with the ‘Fiscal Compact Treaty’. Our future growth is dependent on sustainable public finances and budgetary discipline rather than on creating new debt and deficit. Austerity measures should be seen as a stable foundation for future growth in Europe as they are not mutually exclusive concepts. Take, for example, the case of Latvia – the country which, during the crisis, had the greatest budgetary consolidation (17% of its GDP) in the EU and now is the fastest growing economy in the EU27. In the long-term, stability and growth in the euro area are the most crucial factors and stimulus for other EU countries to join in the upcoming years.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The purpose of the new legislative package, which supplements the 2011 ‘six-pack’ on European economic governance, is to further reinforce the budgetary supervision of Member States in financial difficulty, and to establish an effective crisis prevention mechanism. Both new legislative proposals foresee provisions for euro area Member States. Unfortunately, the experience of the past years has shown quite well that the difficulties of one Member State can have an effect on the economy of the entire EU, and we must therefore create a mechanism that can protect other euro area Member States from any negative ripple effects. We must not forget that the financial crisis affects not only the euro area but the entire EU. It must be stressed, however, that Hungary is involved in two major fights simultaneously, and we Hungarians must therefore assess the situation based on our own criteria. On the one hand, we must address the serious consequences of the faulty economic policy pursued over the past eight years and, on the other, our country is severely affected by the crisis afflicting the euro. Therefore, one of the most important provisions of Hungary’s new Basic Law is the incorporation of budgetary limits. The aim of this public finance rule is to prevent our country from again falling into debt. Our primary task is to ensure the economic recovery of our country, which requires a continuous reduction in our sovereign debt. In this regard the new constitution represents a new beginning for Hungary. Thanks to the results of this renewal, Hungary is now able to stand on its own two feet.</p>

Since 2009, it has been impossible to reduce unemployment rates as a result of the far too little recovery in the labour market.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am sorry to have slowed down the voting but I would like to mention an oral amendment. An additional amendment to paragraph 19 was tabled and adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but was omitted by the secretariat in the final text. I would like to read it.</p>
      <p sl="en">After paragraph 19 as it stands at the moment, we should add the following: ‘supports the use of instruments such as the Early Warning Mechanism in relations with energy suppliers and transit countries; is convinced that further promotion of the idea of common purchasing of energy raw materials by Member States is needed in the context of growing competition for resources and existing producer monopolies’. That is the oral amendment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one in three people in Latin America still live below the poverty line. Twenty-eight million citizens do not know how to read or write and the IMF estimated an average GDP growth rate of four and a half percent for 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome, therefore, Parliament’s report in defining a new development cooperation with Latin America, as it rightly acknowledges that the EU needs to assist the region in eradicating poverty and to help promote sustainable economic and social development. The EU should work with the region to support development and stability by reducing social inequalities. As Latin America is a growing economic region, it is only sensible that the EU should intensify its role to strengthen existing trade and investment relations with the whole of that region, but particularly Brazil and Mexico, which are important strategic partners for investment and trade respectively.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU is the principal donor of development aid and the principal investor in Latin America, as well as being its second largest trade partner. This collaboration has undoubtedly led to positive results for South America, reducing poverty from 44% to 33% in a single decade, and giving the country the prospect, despite the international economic crisis, of 4% growth for 2012. The cycle of growth in Latin America has generated significant social and economic advances, but in many countries this has not, however, coincided with a fair distribution of income or a reduction in social inequalities. It is for this reason that we call on the European Union to further improve the effectiveness of its aid, in order to promote fairer economic and social growth.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report is an important step towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the fulfilment of international commitments to human rights, food security and environmental sustainability. Development aid has noticeably reduced poverty in Latin American countries. The global economic and financial crisis has impacted Latin America less than other regions. However, this is a region in which 180 million people live below the poverty threshold.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is the principal donor of development aid, the principal investor and the second trading partner of this region. It is essential that we continue to support those countries. The rapporteur requests that the Commission present a coherent strategy for the gradual withdrawal of bilateral aid to the middle income countries and that will reinforce aid to the LICs, the low income countries. However, there is a danger in this. It is absolutely crucial that we get this right. Withdrawing or redirecting aid too soon could undo all the years of assistance and the good that we have done.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Latin America is key in global policy, security and trade, yet it is still vulnerable to global risk. It must remain a priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">The eradication of poverty through sustainable development is vital for good governance, democracy and human rights. We must continue to support this region which, despite making progress in eliminating poverty, still has many living below the poverty line. It is also threatened by violence and insecurity, which jeopardise the sustainability of its own development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aid has a positive impact on the region but, for long-lasting change, domestic resources must be developed, tax systems made transparent, corruption and fraud must be eliminated and civil society strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="en">By increasing the well-being of all people, democratic institutions can regain the public’s trust. We must continue the political and human rights dialogues with Latin America, supporting their economic growth and social development.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, although the economic crisis has not affected Latin America as badly as other regions in the world, since this year it is likely to achieve growth of 4.5%, there are still significant discrepancies between the Latin American countries in terms of wealth, and almost 200 million people live below the poverty line. The EU is the leading investor in the region, and the second largest trading partner after the United States. It is therefore very much in our own interest to take measures which support its development. There would appear to be a justified need to strengthen the EU’s presence in this region as a guarantee that it will follow the right path out of the crisis. Cooperating with average-income countries and supporting them will help them to harness their potential to fight poverty and to promote regional development. The key to ensuring prosperity on both continents is trade, and joint measures to support the fight against organised crime are also urgently needed. I support the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I voted in favour of the report. The European Union and Latin America form a strategic partnership, which should also be based on respect for shared values. Our report notes that one of the key goals of the European Union’s external action is to strengthen democratic order and human rights. I welcome the fact that our report calls for one of our priorities to be protection for victims of crime in Latin America. I would like to ask whether this also applies to situations where the perpetrator of the crime is the state apparatus. I have in mind the criminal Castro regime in Cuba, which persecutes its citizens so that they are collectively the victim of one great criminal – the communist regime in Cuba. I voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report on development cooperation with Latin America. I am, however, slightly concerned by the Commission’s current proposals on the development cooperation instrument, which seeks to reduce bilateral aid from the European Union to 11 middle income countries in Latin America and has entirely removed the provision of basic services from its list of priorities for the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Improved political and economic relations with Latin America must continue to be a priority for the European Union. We already have association agreements with Central America, Mexico and Chile, and hopefully soon with Colombia and Peru. Continuing to build on these relationships will bring major benefits to all parties concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the new Pacific Alliance recently signed between Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia, which is a step in the right direction for more regional cooperation, both political and economic, at a time when the Pacto Andino and Mercosur are clearly floundering.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Latin America is a real presentational problem for committed Euro-integrationists. Here is a region with great cultural and linguistic homogeneity, and there is a political unity of outlook. In every capital city, you will find statues of Simon Bolivar; you will find the same legal system; you find cultural inter-changeability; people watch each other’s abominable soap operas; they are able to understand each other – even the Brazilians can understand South American Spanish although, rather unfairly, the reverse is not true – and yet they remain independent countries, despite the best efforts of the European Union which has been pouring money into regional cooperation and integration projects. It has done so even to the extent of refusing to sign trade and aid deals with individual states, insisting on block-to-block cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, whereas the EU takes heterogeneity of nations and creates common political institutions, South America is the opposite. Now guess which one is growing; guess which one has the more successful rates at the moment, despite some of the far Left governments there at the moment. There is a lesson there which is that prosperity comes from competition, diversity, variety and pluralism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we all have to be careful when we talk about a region, because in the same way that I am often critical of those who always want a one-size-fits-all solution for Europe, we should be careful of a one-size-fits-all approach for Latin America. We must recognise that there are countries with varying levels of economic development. If you compare the range from Brazil all the way through to Bolivia, you can see the range of development, and Brazil is clearly a power house.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second thing, which is important for me as a Member of the European Parliament for London, is that we are host to a very large Latin-American community in London and we should be taking advantage of those diaspora communities to encourage more trade links with their home countries. But we should also make sure that we encourage development based on trade issues and investment, and get away from this ideology that we sometimes see here that if a service is not provided by the state, then it should not be provided at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should be encouraging investment in as many services possible – including in education, health and water – to make sure that people are taken out of poverty and live a better life.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, this report strikes me as containing numerous sound ideas. It is a fundamentally attractive idea to want to fight poverty in the world, not least in Latin America. All the initiatives listed are naturally of an attractive nature. When reading the report, however, I cannot help but wonder when the shoe will be on the other foot and it will be Latin America giving the EU advice on how to fight poverty.</p>
      <p sl="da">Over the last ten years, the Mercosur area, the whole of Latin America, has demonstrated a fantastic ability to create growth and development, fight poverty and so on. Over the same period, we in Europe have seen long-term and youth unemployment grow and the recession spread.</p>
      <p sl="da">The report states that free trade is the way forward. I agree. Maybe we should consider the same thing here in Europe. We could strip away all the over-regulation, the over-bureaucratisation of the European continent. We could abandon the strained ideological struggle to cling on to the existence of the euro irrespective of the fact that it creates poverty out in the real world. I believe that the day is very close at hand when the Latin Americans will be the ones giving Europe the advice.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much wish to emphasise the importance of this report on volunteering, and also to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom I had an excellent relationship in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT), especially to ensure that Parliament’s attention on this issue will not wane now that the European Year of Volunteering is over.</p>
      <p sl="it">We were hoping – as I had asked previously in my role as shadow rapporteur – for a White Paper on volunteering work, which unfortunately has not been forthcoming. That would have provided an overall comparative framework at European level between the various situations, defining a status for European volunteering work and ensuring consistent fiscal treatment. I find that, despite not having had this, this report does fill a void and looks ahead. It is important to want to strengthen cross-border volunteering and remove the barriers that hamper many volunteers from gaining access to this opportunity and also, in particular, for disadvantaged people who need to be able to get help from volunteers. I think it is vital for us to find out how widespread volunteering is in areas such as cultural heritage, the environment and sport, and to make sure that in European tenders, the work of voluntary associations can be considered as a form of cofinancing for the purposes of being eligible for such tenders.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am hugely supportive of volunteering activities, many of which help ensure a better quality of life for my Welsh constituents. As well as having enormous societal value, they also serve to equip individuals volunteering with important skills which can assist them later in becoming more employable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst I recognise the importance and merits of promoting cross-border voluntary activities across the EU, and indeed the wider world, I was unable to fully support this report in its current format. I believe that initiatives such as promoting youth volunteering in sport or health and increased cooperation with third countries is of great value. However, I have reservations about the references made in the report concerning its funding. I do not agree that national, regional or local authorities should be mandated to ring-fence funding for organisations involved in volunteering activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also cannot support the recommendation for the creation of a new multiannual programme which would effectively guarantee funds to be available for volunteer projects. In these current economically turbulent times, authorities should be free to determine whether they would like to earmark funds for these voluntary groups or to direct them towards other projects nationally.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are about 100 million European citizens working in various voluntary activities. From major sporting competitions to cultural events, the role played by volunteers is critical. We should also not forget the work done by people who come to offer help and solidarity in the event of major natural or environmental disasters. Volunteering is one of the greatest expressions of active citizenship, an essential activity for the development of values such as democracy and equality within the European Union. For this reason, I hope for the development of high-quality domestic and cross-border volunteering and the removal of any barriers that currently exist.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report which, at the end of the European Year of Volunteering, concretely sets out its objectives and strategies. I fully agree with the aim of increasing the importance of volunteering and promoting cross-border regulation at EU level. Cross-border volunteering is an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth, contributing to the development of an economically and ecologically sustainable social conscience. To this end, I consider three initiatives proposed in the report to be key: the establishment of a centralised portal on volunteering, the creation of a European Humanitarian Aid Corps and the development of a European Skills Passport. I hope, finally, that there will continue to be a strong common will to invest in an area of such importance that promotes the development of common values and helps the integration process.</p>

In theory, these people should not then be allowed to take the jobs of West Europeans, but this is what will happen in practice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">After all, immigrants from non-Member States are allowed to enter Europe without visas, get free access to our health care system, as well as the right to benefits, work after the end of their volunteering period and, indeed, have the right to form a family. We as citizens are mainly supposed to show solidarity for this influx of ‘intercultural enrichment’ and then this Parliament finds it strange that citizens are increasingly turning away from Europe.

Volunteering is not just an outstanding opportunity for personal development and training and for strengthening civic values and morals, but also leads to the promotion of European policies and the creation of social capital. Young people, especially, should be more involved in volunteering, because this means increasing the training they receive, and thereby opening up a future of job opportunities.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I abstained on this report on recognising and promoting cross-border voluntary activities within the European Union. I do support the idea generally, as I fully believe that volunteering should play an important part in our modern-day society. I am particularly keen to see more volunteering amongst young people in London, which is the region I represent, and this chimes well with Prime Minister David Cameron’s idea of the big society in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, despite backing its premise, there were aspects of the report itself with which I could not agree. While there may be a call for volunteering to be made easier, I do not agree with the idea that it would be made easier with the creation of a centralised EU portal, as proposed by the rapporteur, or with the establishment of a European Skills Passport, which sounds very bureaucratic. Surely this is something as an issue – the issue of volunteering, even cross-border volunteering – which is best left to the Member States and to local and regional governments to organise amongst themselves rather than being regulated at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this report; I certainly think it was an appropriate follow-on from last year, the European Year of Volunteering.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report contains a number of very important proposals, first of all, that the ILO Manual on the Measurement of Volunteer Work should be adopted by Member States. This would give us good, robust and comparable data across the EU which could be used by policy makers for making decisions. One of the figures which we already have from the UN satellite accounts is that volunteering contributes between 1% and 5% of GDP. That certainly indicates that not only is it a social good, it is an economic good.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speaking of the economy, it is absolutely essential that, in these times of austerity, there is no adverse impact on voluntary organisations. They need a certain level of assistance and they have shown that they deliver value for money. For every one euro invested in volunteering, there is a return of between EUR 5 and 8. We must also remember that, while volunteer time is unpaid, it is certainly not cost-free.</p>

      <p sl="en">In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, volunteering underpins much of community life. It is estimated that 280 000 people in Northern Ireland regularly give their time as volunteers. However, in recent times, it has become a matter of concern that many volunteering societies are reporting an increased difficulty in volunteer recruitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to this, I am delighted that in March 2012, Northern Ireland’s first ever volunteering strategy was launched. It is my hope that through such strategies, we can continue to nurture and grow our volunteering sector, making it easier for people to contribute their time and views to create the kind of society in which we all want to live.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the economic crisis has fully exposed the fact that it is impossible to build solidarity between states in the absence of solidarity between the citizens of those states. This deficit must be overcome and cross-border cooperation between volunteers is one way in which this can be achieved. The European Year of Voluntary Activities 2011 showed us that we can do a lot to promote voluntary engagement at both European and national levels. In the period under scrutiny, it is very important to strengthen, in particular, the social dimension of volunteering and the importance of working life skills gained when undertaking voluntary activities. Introducing a European Skills Passport is not an ideal solution, but it can help not only young people find jobs under these difficult crisis conditions. I congratulate the rapporteur, and I voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I, too, wish to say a few words about this excellent report drafted by Mr Scurria.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Last year, we celebrated the European Year of Volunteering in the European Union, and it is important that there should be a sequel to it. I might say that, as a result of the work done that year, we know that volunteering is very important. Voluntary work has significance at European level, because it affects more than 100 million Europeans, and, as has been said here on many occasions, it also has a positive impact on the European economy. It accounts for approximately 5% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is also good that we are now going to establish a Skills Passport of this kind. I think of it in particular as something which can be used by young people, and even those of more mature years, to record their various skills, skills which could then be used, for example, when there are major catastrophes and natural disasters. We will know where to find the people we need who have the competence and skills. Voluntary work needs to be acknowledged, and it is very important to promote it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is important that when we consider volunteering, we actually consider the barriers to volunteering and how we overcome those barriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consider the case, in my own constituency, of a lady who ran a Sunday school for 30 years. Suddenly, she was presented with paperwork by a local official. She decided to close that Sunday school down. Consider a friend of mine who was asked to take part in a volunteer football team for local disadvantaged youth. He was sent paperwork of 150 pages. He turned down the opportunity. Consider the example of a friend of mine who was going to set up an amateur dramatic society in his local village, to encourage the local youth to come off the streets. When he looked at the issue of liability insurance and health and safety issues, he decided it was too much and decided not to set up that scheme.</p>
      <p sl="en">When you talk to the people affected by them, you find that all these barriers originate from EU legislation and are gold-plated by local civil servants. So, rather than talking about all this bureaucracy of setting up a central portal to encourage volunteering, we should be removing the barriers to volunteering, in order to encourage the benefits to society.</p>

The leaders of the European Union, who are increasingly removed from its people, are making them pay a huge price with the sole motive of keeping alive their project, which is now markedly dysfunctional.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report correctly assesses the critical and beneficial aspects of the world of volunteering and puts forward significant solutions for cross-border cooperation. It is essential, given freedom of movement within the EU, that voluntary organisations are able to carry out their activities without bureaucratic, economic and social obstacles. The proposal to assess skills at a European level and to create a coordinating body for volunteering work is positive, as is the need to improve information networks, training and financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="it">One issue that is not discussed, but which I regard as worth investigating, is related to the two major classes of volunteers, that is, those who carry out their activities totally free of charge and those who receive an allowance or salary. It would be good to get a breakdown of the skills and fields of intervention for each of these modes of volunteering which, although different, are equally indispensable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with the increased prevalence of cybersecurity threats, it is prudent for the EU to develop and review its strategy with regard to key infrastructure projects. Cybersecurity attacks have been known to cause complete havoc across the EU and globally, with their tactics becoming more and more sophisticated.</p>
      <p sl="en">The effects of an attack can be highly damaging and costly, particularly to businesses, which are often subject to thefts of their intellectual property. My government in the UK has recognised this and listed cybersecurity as one of its top priorities. However, these threats do not recognise national borders, and so I support the EU coordinating efforts to counter large-scale attacks.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the EU is not alone in being subjected to these attacks, it is sensible to develop a global coordinated strategy and response, along with private companies, to counter them.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the communications sector to finance, transport, energy, culture or health, the role played by technology is increasingly important. The growing use of the Internet and digital media makes the problem of cybersecurity a priority for the European Union. Information and communication technologies can, in fact, promote economic and social development only if the existing regulations guarantee users’ safety on matters such as data privacy and intellectual property rights. For this reason, only full international cooperation involving all Member States, institutions and the industries in the sector can establish a robust system, capable of introducing measures that can effectively ensure cybersecurity.</p>

The Internet is a critical infrastructure. Online attacks can cause serious consequences and safety risks for both businesses and private households. For this reason, I agree on the urgency, highlighted in the report, to develop a reactive, flexible framework to prevent cyber attacks. Since virtuality does not have boundaries, it will be necessary to improve international cooperation and regulations in order to make future strategies effective. In this respect, the European External Action Service (EEAS) can and must play a key role in starting a constructive dialogue with third countries, including, where possible, issues regarding Internet security in the scope of its external relations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the role of technology has increasingly expanded in our everyday lives in all of its aspects, from communication to finance and banking, from transportation to energy, from culture and entertainment to health. Nowadays, with the increasing use of the Internet and computer-based technologies, the security of the Internet stands as one of the highest political priorities for the EU and for the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU 2020 strategy included the EU digital agenda as a flagship policy, setting ambitious goals for the technological development of the EU. The increasing use and deployment of innovative ICT technologies and Internet services all rely on cybersecurity and resilience. The next steps to be taken have to be to increase the focus on international cooperation beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is a reaction to the Commission’s 2011 communication on critical information infrastructure protection, where Parliament recognised that the Internet is a critical infrastructure that requires not only protection measures but also the prevention of the Internet attacks that have been repeated time and time again. This has to be a priority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it could actually be said that the protection of critical information structures on the Internet is an underappreciated threat. For many people, the Internet is simply a place where information is stored and exchanged. That time has long since passed. Since those days, the Internet now hosts flows of money, there is online banking and, ultimately, security systems for economic activity are also controlled via the Internet. That being the case, we have to deal not only with industrial espionage, but also, to some extent, terrorism. Then there are also groups that simply aim to destroy Internet connections and programmes, just because they want to. We need to put the brakes on such activities as, at the end of the day, this is about all our safety. For that reason, this is an absolutely crucial report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also agree on highlighting the importance of critical information infrastructures. They are important for safety, for economic and commercial trade and, in general terms, for improving European citizens’ quality of life. However, these critical infrastructures are often not properly protected or upgraded. Just think of the level of sophistication that cyber attacks have reached. It is therefore necessary to make a greater effort to protect these critical infrastructures, including through an integrated approach, both at EU and transcontinental level – namely, the European Union and the United States.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, it is advisable, among other things, to create and invest in education on cybersecurity. I am thinking, for example, of internships, university courses and training for students. These are, in fact, activities involving specialised information which, as well as protecting critical information infrastructures, give great opportunities for our youth.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can make a significant contribution to the development of the economy and society. However, to make the most of these potentials, first they need to be made secure.

      <p sl="it">I supported Mr Kalfin’s proposal because I believe that the potential offered by the web, in terms of both innovation and growth for European enterprises, must not be lost, especially in a highly competitive context such as currently exists at global level.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, modern technology plays an increasingly ubiquitous role in our daily lives. We use the Internet to carry out many essential tasks in a wide range of areas, from communications and banking to work, culture and entertainment. Internet security is therefore gradually becoming our top security priority. As we learned from the events in Estonia, cyber attacks can paralyse the state as effectively as a military attack or a disaster. We should also be mindful of the fact that any disruption to the functioning of the Internet may result in significant losses and security hazards, which will have an impact on the situation of European citizens and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of adopting the report.

Today, they seem entirely possible, and not just in the near future but here and now, as we can see, for example, in the recent report stating that the North Korean regime has invested a great deal of money in training its own cyber terrorists who plan various attacks on the West on behalf of the North Korean communist regime.

I believe that the Commission’s approach to this is very serious – this is a very serious issue – and it is the right one. This is something which we as the European Union or, for that matter, the Member States alone, do not have the capacity to face; we need international cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I fully back the Commission’s conclusion that we must work harder to form a better global understanding of the risk of cybersecurity on the Internet and to share best IT practice on how to reduce the risk. In order to do this, we must improve communications at every level between private and public sectors, between Member States and international organisations, in particular within NATO, and I therefore back the Commission’s calls for the Member States to set up – if they have not done so already – national cyber incidence contingency plans as well as fully operational computer emergency response teams which will, as well as offering heightened protection, be able to share best practice against cyber attacks, including cyberterrorist attacks, with their counterparts in other Member States and also globally, for that matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">But we have to be careful, because in this place, whatever the problem, the solution appears to be more Europe and more regulation.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with the global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, global energy demand is forecast to increase by 40% in the shorter period of now until 2030. So competition for scarce fossil fuels will grow accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States within the EU need to develop and coordinate their energy policies with all strategic partners, particularly given the current challenges we are facing in energy security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some Member States are becoming increasingly interconnected with respect to their energy supply already, so a coordinated EU approach may help energy security for the EU as a whole. It is similarly important for the EU to look to a number of new countries to supply its energy, in order to avoid reliance on a small number of suppliers. There is a need to strengthen relationships with key strategic partners, including Russia.</p>

The fact that Europe is a major purchaser of energy on global markets can, in fact, be seen as a weakness. On the other hand, the fact that we are also the biggest importer could be one of our strengths, if only the EU countries were to take a common negotiating position with third countries. I therefore support the approach proposed by our colleague, in particular, with regard to the three objectives underlying the whole strategy; namely, improvement and coordination at EU level, especially in strategic sectors such as research and innovation, the need for increased diversification of energy sources and, finally, the development of sustainable common policies on a global scale.</p>

If we want to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and of the road map for a low carbon economy by 2050, we need to improve our cooperation in terms of energy policy today. From this point of view, both increased diversification of EU supply sources and the development of renewable energy sources will be essential. In this context, effective coordination with industry is crucial in order to encourage in concrete terms the investments able to favour economic growth and development and, at the same time, those able to ensure clean and safe energy.

Those who have already spoken have already rightly pointed out that this is a focus that we have to have. The other focus is to be as efficient as possible with the energy that we use. That is a second key consideration. I would also like to add a third one, which is that we should try, increasingly, to develop our own energy resources, including through scientific progress.

      <p sl="en">The Energy Charter’s practical use will grow significantly when not only Russia but also countries like Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and China are full members.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, over the past decade, energy has become an instrument of foreign policy. This applies in particular to Russia, since the Kremlin’s foreign policy involves subjecting a number of fuel importers, such as my country, Poland, to political blackmail. Russian negotiations on supplies usually centre on issues which have nothing to do with economic and trade relations in the strict sense of the term. It is wrong for Member States with stronger economic positions to be granted significantly more favourable terms in otherwise identical contracts, since it is proof of discrimination against the others.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The solution that has been proposed is for the EU Member States to adopt a jointly coordinated negotiating position, which will allow all of us to be recognised as strong players on the global energy market. We should be speaking with one voice, especially when it comes to relations with Moscow, since this will significantly improve the position of countries such as Poland, which are dependent on Russian supplies. The diversification of energy supplies is in the interests of my country and the EU as a whole. I therefore support all measures in this area, and would like to ask the House to support investments in the Świnoujście gas terminal.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is 10 years since a very senior representative of the Russian secret service said in public that Russia used Gazprom as a political tool. The past 10 years have proven him entirely right. What we are faced with today is a situation where Russia is using negotiations on gas prices to divide the European Union. Better-regarded countries which enjoy friendlier relations with Russia are rewarded with lower prices. If Russia wishes to exert pressure on certain countries, they are charged more for Russian gas. This means firstly that diversifying gas supplies is very important for the European Union’s citizens, but I also support the report’s proposal for the European Commission to automatically be involved in negotiations with third countries. In order to do so, we need European solidarity, so that those countries which are less powerful in the face of the mighty Russians can count on their stronger Western partners, or, in other words, the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I abstained on this report for one very important reason. I do not accept that Member States should have a mandatory obligation to involve the European Commission in discussions and agreements on energy generation and supply contracts. It may be appropriate bilaterally. That is up to them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to specifically mention the bilateral memorandum of understanding signed by the UK and Iceland on 30 May 2012. The two parties have pledged, amongst many other things, to exchange information on development of the deep geothermal sector. This is a clean, environmentally sustainable energy source, an area where Iceland is a clear technological leader globally and has much to teach us. The UK is testing this technology and will greatly benefit from this relationship.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think we can see a rationale why, in an increasingly interconnected world, it is important that we look at energy cooperation and coordination – with coordination, not coercion, being the key – particularly when some countries are concerned about over-dependence on Russia for energy supplies.</p>
      <p sl="en">But when we are looking at energy supplies, we should be looking at diversification and barriers to new supplies. Let us look at issues such as more micro-generation; let us look at how we continue to use fossil fuels by using technologies such as carbon capture to make sure it is used in a clean way; let us look at how we can use palm oil stearin and other non-edible by-products of palm oil to ensure better energy diversification; and let us look at the issue of nuclear power.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let us also look at bureaucracy getting in the way of supplies. This year in May, British Gas Group pulled out of building a liquefied natural gas terminal in Brindisi in South Italy after 11 years and investing EUR 250 million – because of local bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is that sort of bureaucracy that does more to harm the supply of energy than anything else. Let us get rid of the bureaucracy instead of giving more power to the Commission and negotiating positions to the Commission.</p>

Or is it electricity that we import from Russia? No, it is not, and that means that our focus is completely wrong. We should be focusing on what we fill our cars with.

The aim of this proposal is to support the reintegration into the labour market of the Spanish workers made redundant in the wake of the global economic and financial crisis. The redundancies in the Comunidad Valenciana region were caused by the radical change in the geographical distribution of footwear production and relocation of manufacturing to third countries. As a result of the rise in imports and fall in exports of footwear within the EU, the number of manufacturers in Spain has dropped by 36%. In addition, 188 footwear manufacturers closed down in the Comunidad Valenciana region. Against this backdrop, I wish to highlight the need for the financial assistance offered by the EU to be made available as quickly and efficiently as possible. I should also stress how important it is to improve the vocational training for these workers, as well as to acknowledge their capabilities and skills.</p>

It has a global reputation and is an industry Spain should fight to preserve. The EGF will do for unique industries what bail outs have done for Member States’ economies, which is to weaken their resolve and force them to subsume within a wider European ideology.

This adds to the dozens of mobilisations requested in December 2011, prior to the termination of the crisis derogation. Once again, we can only regret the Council’s decision not to extend the crisis derogation, which increased the EU cofinancing rate to 65%, beyond 31 December 2011. This means that the countries with the greatest economic and social difficulties – those where the most companies have gone bankrupt and where there is the most unemployment – are those that will least be able to make use of the EGF. We continue to advocate the increase in EGF cofinancing, particularly for countries in a fragile economic state such as Portugal, in order to ensure that the national contribution does not exceed 5% of the total financing planned. At the same time, however, we will, above all, continue to advocate a reversal of the policies that led to the existence of the EGF and which make its mobilisation necessary.</p>

Considering all this and considering that Spain has confirmed, on the one hand, that the contribution from the EGF does not replace measures which are the responsibility of companies and, on the other hand, that the planned actions – designed to provide support for individual workers – do not receive assistance from other EU financial instruments, I voted in favour.</p>

The industry is currently being hit by highly aggressive competition from Asian countries and is faced with making numerous redundancies. I voted firmly in favour of adopting this report.

Unless these workers are given an opportunity to upskill or retrain, they will add to the already unacceptably high rate of unemployment in Spain. With unemployment at 24.3%, youth unemployment a staggering 51.5%, and GDP set to decrease by 1.8% this year, Spanish workers need assistance to give them opportunities to find employment or set up their own businesses. In this context, I call on the Council to reconsider its approach on EGF and ask the blocking minority to reconsider, to look at the added value of the EGF, and to remember, in particular, the needs of low-skilled and unskilled workers who lose their jobs.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide additional support for workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade, within an annual limit of EUR 500 million. 11.5% of Spanish footwear companies are based in the Comunidad Valenciana region, with a 26% share of regional employment. Imports of footwear in Spain during the period 2006-2010 increased by 20% and more than 10 000 jobs disappeared. Spain asks for the refinancing of a coordinated package of personalised services to enable training for specific vocational qualifications, support for job search and outplacement, or the setting up of a new business with a prerequisite for the reintegration of 876 workers back into production. I supported this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this proposal. One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis. The Spanish authorities describe the redundancies in the Comunidad Valenciana region against a background of radical change in the distribution of footwear production. Third countries, specifically China and India, increasingly dominate the world trade in footwear, and countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia continue to increase their share of world production. The Spanish authorities argue that, according to available data, imports of footwear from non-EU countries into the EU increased almost 6% during the period 2006-2009, while EU exports declined by 16.4% during the same period. As a direct consequence of the fall in exports, the number of footwear producers in the EU27 decreased: in 2008, there were only 24 000 producers in the EU while in 2005, there were still 27 125. This reduction (11.58%) in the number of firms had a direct impact on employment: 78 800 direct jobs – representing almost 20% of the total – were lost in the sector during the period 2005-2008.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) provides considerable support to workers made redundant as a result of structural changes taking place in global trade patterns and, more recently, due to the effects of the economic crisis. The main economic problem facing Spain is the alarming unemployment rate. At present, Spain has an unemployment rate of 25%, which means that more than 5 million are unemployed. The hardest hit areas are the industrialised zones which are gradually losing ground in competing with the emerging countries. I feel that the support provided through EGF funding is important, and it can be compared to a lifeline to help those who have been made redundant. However, the affected workers need further considerable support through the European Social Fund programmes whose aim is to retrain and reintegrate them into the labour market. I voted for this report as I feel that the workers made redundant need this support urgently. The areas hit with redundancies should receive special attention from the authorities in order to attract new investments and support for business opportunities. Renewable energy is one area offering potential for creating jobs. I should point out that the workers made redundant in Comunidad Valenciana are currently building the largest solar park in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">As a result of the credit crunch, many small and medium-sized enterprises found themselves in serious difficulties. The business model of the Comunidad Valenciana is characterised by a high proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises, which predominantly specialise in the manufacture of furniture, shoes, textiles, ceramics and toys. These businesses are concentrated on the outskirts of a limited number of municipalities. The redundancies in the Comunidad Valenciana region were caused by a radical market change in the shoe industry, in which third countries – above all, China and India, but also Vietnam and Indonesia – increasingly dominate the global trade in shoes. Generally speaking, in the shoe industry, most menial processes have been offshored to cheaper, non-EU countries, with only the high-value production steps, such as product design and product marketing, remaining in the EU. I voted in favour of the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as all the criteria for its mobilisation are satisfied.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The economic crisis and the increase in competition from third countries has led to a decline in business for European footwear producers. Exports of shoes from the EU fell by 16.4% between 2006 and 2009. While this affects all EU countries, the impact on Spain is more severe than elsewhere: the number of footwear producers dropped by 36% between 2006 and 2010, resulting in over 10 000 job losses. In the Comunidad Valenciana region, which has been hit hard by the recession, the situation of these producers is particularly concerning. In December 2011, Spain requested that the region’s troubled workers be able to benefit from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund’s assistance. Through the adoption of this resolution, we are agreeing to release over EUR 1.6 million in aid. This will enable us to help 876 former employees of 146 footwear producers to seek employment, through measures such as job search assistance, professional training and support for setting up businesses. I lend my support to this initiative, while once again underlining that supporting industrial manufacturing in Europe has never been more necessary.</p>

Third countries, specifically China and India, increasingly dominate the world trade in footwear, and countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia continue to increase their share of world production.

The Commission has established that this application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 and, therefore, on 4 May, it adopted a proposal for a decision to mobilise EUR 1 631 565 in favour of Spain.</p>

      <p sl="it">The scope of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was broadened for applications submitted from 1 May 2009 to include support to workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis. In this regard, Spain has been experiencing a deep crisis in the footwear industry due to the impact of the imbalance between imports and exports. This imbalance was bigger than in the EU as a whole, thus creating a huge wave of redundancies following the general trend in the footwear industry in the EU towards relocation to non-EU countries of most of the manufacturing sub-processes. Employment in this specific sector has contracted by 31.80% and 188 enterprises have stopped their activity.</p>

In particular, I support measures for vocational training which seek to create high-added value jobs within the footwear sector, thereby avoiding the loss of expertise acquired in this sector.

The footwear sector represents 26% of the total employment in the Comunidad Valenciana region and is therefore an important contributor to the local economy, which is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises in traditional sectors like textiles, footwear and ceramics. I should point out that the implementation of this application addressing mass redundancies in a large number of SMEs in one sector ought to provide an example in terms of the eligibility of the self-employed and owners of SMEs for EGF support in the future regulation.

This case in Spain adds to the dozens of mobilisations requested in December 2011, prior to the termination of the crisis derogation. Once again, we can only regret the Council’s decision not to extend the crisis derogation, which increased the rate of EU cofinancing to 65%, beyond 31 December 2011. This means that the countries with the greatest economic and social difficulties – those where the most companies have gone bankrupt and where there is the most unemployment – are those that will least be able to make use of the EGF. We continue to advocate the increase in EGF cofinancing, particularly for countries in a fragile economic state such as Portugal, in order to ensure that the national contribution does not exceed 5% of the total financing planned.</p>

In the general interest, it is important to fine tune the system in light of the painful experience that we have faced, in order to mobilise the Solidarity Fund more quickly and efficiently.</p>

I support the wish expressed in the resolution to see the quicker release of financial assistance in the future, since currently, red tape and the lack of coordination between the various competent authorities greatly delay the procedure.

The need to come to the aid of disaster-stricken regions motivated the setting out of a draft amending budget containing provisions for granting aid to such regions. I voted to provide EU assistance for those who have lost so much and to make changes to the appropriate financial assistance, so that this aid will fit into the EU’s accounts.

This report, drafted by Ms Balzani, deals with draft amending budget No 2/2012 of the European Union for the financial year 2012, Section III – European Commission, to enable the aforementioned mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) for an amount of EUR 18 061 682 in commitment and payment appropriations following the flooding in Italy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The draft amending budget that this report approves relates to the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) to mitigate the effects of flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, in Italy, in October 2011. An amount of approximately EUR 18 million in commitment and payment appropriations has been established. The purpose of this amending budget is formally to include this budgetary adjustment in the 2012 budget. The report considers ‘of great importance the quick release of financial assistance through the [EUSF] for those affected by natural catastrophes’, and therefore greatly laments ‘that the other branch of the budgetary authority has waited 8 weeks before taking its position’. Unfortunately, such situations have been arising repeatedly. We voted for the report, since we agree that regions affected by natural disasters of this nature and others should be able to count on prompt EUSF support. The flooding that affected the regions of Liguria and Tuscany in October 2011 caused severe damage to homes, businesses and agriculture and the disruption of major transport links and essential public infrastructure networks. As such, it is important that funding for reconstruction and damage cover be made available as soon as possible to support these populations.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the reports by Francesca Balzani. Following flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied for assistance to the European Union; the disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). I would remind you that the Solidarity Fund should be mobilised mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on the living conditions, environment or economy of one or more regions of a Member State. The conditions in the affected areas worsened, as always happens in these situations, because of the tragedy of the lives lost, the large number of wounded people, the families who lost everything and the very serious damage to homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructures. In these regions, the use of the EUR 18 million released by the fund will therefore help our fellow citizens to regain the peace of mind that they have sadly lost. Finally, let me congratulate the volunteers of the Italian Civil Protection Agency who, in those weeks, as well as currently in Emilia and Lombardy and as always in the past, have shown professionalism and humanity.</p>

      <p sl="sk">EUR 18 061 682 in commitment and payment appropriations relating to flooding in Italy in October 2011. On 25 October 2011, an extreme weather system centred over north-west Italy led to a vast amount of rain falling within just a few hours. Worst affected were the provinces of La Spezia in Liguria and Massa Carrara in Tuscany. The torrential rains caused widespread damage to residential homes, businesses and agriculture and the disruption of major transport links and essential public infrastructure networks. Parts of the disaster zone concern the area of ‘Cinque Terre’, an integral part of the Italian Riviera and a UNESCO World Heritage site. As a result of this disaster, Italy subsequently submitted an application for financial assistance from the European Union Solidarity Fund. As total damage remains below the normal threshold for mobilising the Solidarity Fund, the application was examined on the basis of the criteria for so-called ‘extraordinary regional disasters’. Based on the above, a region can exceptionally benefit from assistance from the fund where that region has been affected by an extraordinary disaster, mainly a natural one, affecting the major part of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and the economic stability of the region. I believe it is reasonable to release financial assistance to areas affected by disasters through the EU Solidarity Fund.</p>

However, for this fund to be successful in the future, and for funding to be granted promptly, we need to make its application simpler and more transparent. The unnecessary delay caused by the Commission seeking funding through negative reserves was completely avoidable, and this practice is completely unacceptable to me and the majority of Member States. Thankfully, the Danish Presidency presented a compromise in which the necessary funding was found from a reallocation of under-implemented lines in the European Energy Plan. Although this reallocation is a messy solution, it is preferable to using negative reserves. I hope this money will go some way towards relieving the suffering of those affected by the floods.</p>

Both farm animals and crops are at risk and if they are lost, then farmers may suffer a major drop in income. Regions hit by floods rarely manage to overcome their problems alone. Funding is needed to ensure that these areas are revitalised as soon as possible.

I deplore the fact that the other branch of the budgetary authority has waited eight weeks before taking its position, sticking to its interpretation of Protocol 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (deadline for national parliaments’ information). I call on all the stakeholders in the Member States, at both local and regional level, as well as national authorities, to improve how needs are assessed and how future potential applications to the EUSF are coordinated, with a view to mobilising this fund as quickly as possible for those affected.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The floods which hit the regions of Liguria and Tuscany in 2011 took an alarming toll: nine people killed and ten missing. The losses suffered by the two regions have been estimated at over EUR 700 million, after over 330 million cubic metres of water fell during a period of less than six hours. This gigantic amount of rainfall and record breaking cloudburst resulted in the rivers in this part of Italy overflowing their banks. The villages and small towns which lie along these rivers were inundated by a tidal wave of water, mud and stones. An amending budget must be adopted for the Solidarity Fund as a result of this tragedy which hit the citizens of Italy. Natural disasters cause huge losses in the regions where they occur. I am aware that this assistance for Italy will not cover all of the losses suffered by the people living there. However, I hope that it will help in some way to reconstruct the infrastructure in these regions and to return to normal life.</p>

Therefore, deploying in these regions the EUR 18 million granted from the fund will help our fellow citizens regain the peace of mind which, unfortunately, they have lost.

As explained by the rapporteur, the total number of workers set to benefit from this series of cofinanced personalised services is 3 582, 1 384 of whom were made redundant from Renault and seven of its suppliers between 1 April 2009 and 31 July 2009, while 2 198 other workers were made redundant by the same eight companies.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (hereinafter EGF) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional assistance to workers made redundant due to the major structural changes in world trade patterns. During the economic and financial crisis, financial assistance from this fund could also be allocated to people made redundant due to the consequences of the crisis. The EGF Regulation provides that 0.3% of the annual maximum EGF amount may be made available each year for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. In view of this provision, I welcomed the allocation of EUR 1.12 million from the EGF, to ensure the proper implementation of the EGF Regulation. However, the Commission must also take into account the European Parliament’s requests, particularly with regard to savings in the areas of administrative and technical support, the creation of a knowledge base and effective monitoring. I take a negative view of the Council’s decision to block the extension of the crisis derogation, under which it was possible to provide financial assistance to workers made redundant as a result of the current financial and economic crisis, and to increase the rate of Union cofinancing to 65% of the programme costs. I believe that, given the difficult economic situation that remains and the high level of unemployment in the Member States, the validity of this exceptional provision needs to be extended.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report because I support the rapporteur’s proposal to mobilise EUR 730 000 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in commitment and payment appropriations to provide technical assistance on the Commission’s initiative. I should stress how important this fund is at a time when workers who have been made redundant need support in their efforts to find a new job. In fact, the role of the EGF is precisely to provide additional support to workers affected by the major structural changes in global trade patterns. This instrument has proved to be useful up until now in mitigating the impact of the economic crisis, as well as in preventing other social disasters. However, I think that EU assistance provided in this respect should be more dynamic, and it needs to be made available as quickly and efficiently as possible. I would like to point out the importance of networking and exchanging information on the fund. At the same time, I think that procedural and budgetary mechanisms ought to be improved in order to mobilise the EGF more quickly.</p>

This report, which confirms the Council’s decision to mobilise the sum of EUR 730 000 out of the EUR 1 750 000 which could, in theory, be legally released, takes a sensible position at a time when public money must be managed as efficiently as possible.

No clear data was presented on the impact and efficiency of the information tools funded by technical assistance resources in previous years. I therefore take the view that we lack the inputs to be able to assess whether, and to what extent, it is necessary to push for greater general awareness of, and greater visibility of, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.

      <p sl="pt">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has been used extensively in recent years as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis which has struck the European Union. This has been exacerbated, inter alia , by the globalisation of trade, the ageing of the population and the obsolescence of certain industries. In the course of its existence and mobilisation, certain imperfections have been detected and it has become clear that procedures need to be streamlined so as to have a positive impact on the lives of the unemployed workers whom it seeks to help. Technical support for the EGF is thus essential. The EU should, as far as possible, maintain the same type of financial allocation for this support so as to not permit backtracking in the way the support is applied, released, monitored and evaluated.</p>

According to Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, the proportion corresponding to 0.35% of the annual maximum amount of the EGF can be made available each year for technical assistance. The proposed contribution for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission in 2012 is EUR 1 120 000. Following the mobilisation of this amount, the sum of EUR 630 000 potentially remains available in case of further need at a later stage in the year.

In regard to workers, it is extremely important that they are fully informed as to what is happening. Also, the managing authorities need the opportunities to learn from best practice elsewhere. Having examined most of the EGF application as part of the EGF working group, it is very clear that some Member States have really good systems in place and this delivers much better outcomes for workers.

Firstly, the Commission’s proposal complies with Article 8 of the regulation establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. In spite of this, however, the proposal was blocked by a minority in the Council, as a result of which the Danish Presidency drafted a compromise proposal with a figure of EUR 730 000, which is equivalent to the Commission’s average expenditure in previous years. I believe that adopting the Presidency’s proposal is a sensible way to mobilise funds rapidly in order to implement the measures planned by the Commission, in particular, the programme evaluation which is vitally important in the context of the debate surrounding the programme’s future. In addition, I think it is significant that the Council has called for steps to be taken as soon as possible to extend the derogation and to enable support to be granted under the EGF for workers made redundant as a result of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="el">Firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. The purpose of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is to support dismissed workers, especially in regions and sectors disadvantaged by the globalised economy. According to the EGF Regulation, the limit of 0.35% of the EGF amount can be made available each year for technical assistance. The Commission has asked for EUR 1.12 million for technical assistance in 2012. For its part, the Council proposed that the amount requested for technical assistance should be reduced to EUR 730 000, on the grounds that the future of the EGF in the next multiannual financial framework is still unclear. Even though the European Commission and the European Parliament accepted the Council’s proposal, we should make it clear, for our part, that the negative consequences of globalisation, combined with the continuing economic crisis, provide even more proof of the added value of the EGF as an EU social policy instrument. The targeted financial support which it provides under retraining and reintegration programmes for workers hit by mass redundancies is especially important. Furthermore, the support which it provides is a real expression of EU solidarity.</p>

Ultimately, I voted for this report, as I believe the amount in question can assist the European institutions in making every effort to improve the EGF’s procedural and budgetary arrangements.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. I welcome the introduction of the appropriate legislative and budgetary instruments needed to provide additional support to workers affected by the major structural changes in world trade patterns and the economic and financial crisis, and to assist their reintegration into the labour market. I think that assistance provided by the European Union to redundant workers should be more dynamic and ought to be made available as quickly and efficiently as possible. I welcome the creation of a website, available in all the official EU languages, to provide and distribute information on applications, while also highlighting the role of the budgetary authority. I regret that the results of the final evaluation of the EGF will arrive too late to feed into the discussion on the new regulation for the EGF in 2014-2020, especially regarding the effectiveness in using the crisis derogation criterion, since the relevant EGF cases were not analysed in the EGF mid-term evaluation report.</p>

This takes the form of regional and bilateral agreements covering every area of commercial, technical, financial, cultural and political activity. The global economic and financial crisis is having a significant impact on European economies. However, it is noticeable that the crisis has had a less severe impact on Latin America and that the economic growth forecast for 2012 is 4.5%. The IMF clearly states that the uncertainties over global recovery could affect economic growth in Latin America.

As the principal donor of development aid in Latin America, the European Union hopes to further cooperation in this region by promoting dialogue on climate change, innovation and the fight against drugs. Although Latin America has experienced the largest increase in growth in recent years, the region must continue its efforts to consolidate the Rule of Law. This is because, despite progress in terms of social justice and improved living standards, 52 million people live on less than two dollars a day. In this sense, there are many challenges yet to be addressed in the fight against poverty and social cohesion, the promotion of entrepreneurship and private sector development. It is equally important to encourage social services by investing in research and innovation. This new cooperation is also bound to enhance bi-regional relations through the signing of the association agreement with Central America.

We need to rethink and act more efficiently within the framework of our Latin American development cooperation policy, by adopting a different approach to each country, in articulation with our trade policy, that takes into account its specific nature, whilst making available resources through the development cooperation instrument to improve living conditions, to promote equality and decent work, to reform the judicial system, to combat violence and crime, and to conserve biodiversity and sustainable development in the region.

As it is aware of this phenomenon, the European Union, the principal donor of international aid to Latin American countries, has cooperated with other international organisations.

Confusion between a development cooperation policy – which is necessary and desirable – and defending the trade interests of European big business is manifest in several points in this report. The concerns expressed at China’s growing presence in the region are revealing. The normal rhetoric surrounding human rights cannot conceal flagrant contradictions. It advocates an association agreement with Colombia, whilst ignoring the country’s persistent problems. It also ignores the criminal embargo that has been imposed on Cuba for decades. A self-serving vision of human rights that we repudiate is once again evident.

The EP will soon be questioned about its approval of the free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru and on the association agreement with Central America.

These countries often face significant inequalities and weak governance that endangers the sustainability of their own development process. Middle income countries play an important role in global policy, security and trade issues, producing and protecting global public goods.

The fact that some countries in Latin America have risen to become major global economic powers has not worked to the benefit of all. Although absolute poverty has been reduced, inequality within countries has only increased. Furthermore, the success of the economic engines has eluded countries that have not managed to get on the road to economic growth. That is why it is time for the EU to re-assess the needs underlying its allocation of development aid. The EU’s development policy must mean looking at each country’s individual situation and a wider set of indicators than merely average income levels when measuring poverty, especially in middle income countries (MICs). In this process, the targets for sustainable development decided upon at the Rio+20 conference would become the focal point. Cooperation on technology and innovation with MICs is an interesting new area, and one that is still potentially far-reaching. The EU is Latin America’s largest donor of development aid, but changing times dictate that it needs to be readjusted and reallocated.</p>

This is a region where 180 million people live below the poverty line and ten countries in the region remain among the fifteen countries with the highest inequality in the world.

      <p sl="ro">Latin America will continue to be a priority for the European Union, which is primarily highlighted by bi-regional relations where there has been substantial progress made in recent years. As a member of Parliament’s delegation for relations with Mercosur, I think that the European Union needs to continue to provide intensive support to the process of developing and stabilising the region, and to devise, in close collaboration with Latin American states, a development policy for the region which is sustainable, fair and balanced. With this aim in mind, I recommend stepping up bilateral dialogue and cooperation in key areas of common interest, such as energy, transport, research, science and technology, as well as good fiscal governance. This entails adapting relations in each individual case in order to reap the biggest mutual benefits. Furthermore, this approach will complement and support the efforts aimed at achieving greater regional integration.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In recent years, Latin America has experienced one of the highest growth rates. Yet development aid funds still need to be maintained in the region. This is because one in three inhabitants still lives below the poverty line. Some countries of Latin America are among the most economically and socially unequal in the world; violence is rife and crime rates are soaring. To address poverty reduction, cooperation must be redirected to where it is needed the most. Given the economic and social heterogeneity of countries in the region, differentiated cooperation needs to be maintained. Development aid can only be reduced gradually so that these countries can consolidate their Rule of Law and further reduce the risk of extreme poverty. Latin America shares certain values with the European Union. The two regions have common interests and it is therefore together that we should address the current challenges facing our societies, as we are more interdependent than ever.</p>

While the agreement with Latin America is not perfect – as there are a few points that could have been changed – overall, it is an agreement worthy of support. With this agreement, the EU is making a contribution to integration in Latin America. This agreement makes it possible to create jobs, fight poverty, drive forward political, economic and trade-based integration in the region and other things besides. However, I find it necessary to highlight the absence of a comprehensive EU policy and a regional approach to Latin America in support of South-South cooperation (SSC), and the lack of clear EU policy guidelines in regard to SSC and inter-regional association aiming at the creation of autonomous spaces for coordination and political cooperation among Latin American countries, without European or North American involvement. Given that some are predicting that, by 2015, China’s trade with Latin America will surpass that of Europe, this is something that we need to counteract. There are a few things we can take from this agreement. All things considered, I therefore voted in favour of this agreement.</p>

Unfortunately, 180 million people are still living below the poverty threshold in Latin America. It was therefore important to define a new cooperation with Latin America, in particular, by changing the tools to help this cooperation. Indeed, as the rapporteur recommends, the focus should be on the gradual withdrawal of bilateral aid to middle income countries (MICs) in order to reinforce aid to low income countries (LICs). Faced with the humanitarian and health situation of Latin American countries, it is vital that essential services such as education, training, health and hygiene, removed by the European Commission, are reprioritised. Finally, and as a driving force behind the future of this cooperation, regional policies need to be stimulated in order to reset budgetary and fiscal policies.

I therefore voted in favour of a report which aims to facilitate the practice of cross-border volunteering. Besides being an incredible opportunity for exchange and learning, volunteering can also contribute to growth and already accounts for almost 5% of GDP in the European Union. We should acknowledge and value the practice of volunteering.</p>

      <p sl="ga">80% of the European public feels that volunteering is an important aspect of society. Over 100 million people in the EU engage in regular volunteering and generate 5% of Europe’s GDP.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Young and old in the EU engage in volunteering in the following sectors: education, sport, culture, the environment, youth, sustainable development, health, immigration, human rights, corporate social responsibility and the EU’s relations with other countries. It is particularly gratifying to me that my recommendations for implementing a qualifications framework for volunteer sports coaches were accepted. The time and resources being put into the training of trainers must be acknowledged, and the skills in question must be transferable.</p>
      <p sl="ga">To that end, I welcome the proposal for a European Skills Passport for volunteers. This passport will increase mobility in the voluntary sector and create an important and valuable link between informal learning and formal education. Students will now be better off on account of informal learning and skills being recognised under the European Credit Transfer System. That will increase the ability of students to find employment.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I supported the report entitled ‘Recognising and promoting cross-border voluntary activities in the EU’. In my opinion, this document discusses comprehensively the benefits, results and deficiencies of volunteering in Europe. Even after the end of the European Year of Volunteering (2011), volunteering remains a major aspect of the European Year for Active Ageing (2012) and the European Year of Citizens (2013).</p>
      <p sl="hu">I agree that through their activities, volunteers acquire skills that would be worth summarising in a common ‘European Skills Passport’. This could be used to motivate volunteers or to publicly recognise their experience in this field. Furthermore, voluntary activities also facilitate intercultural learning, as volunteers can learn languages and become acquainted with the local culture where they work. Additionally, as a Hungarian Member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I find it important to establish good cooperation with volunteers working in third countries; I am thinking here specifically of Serbia and Ukraine, and the positive effects of the voluntary activities conducted there on democracy and on the promotion of the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. 2011 was declared the European Year of Voluntary Activities, which was aimed at drawing the public’s attention to this important area and promoting volunteering, particularly among young and older people. The number of people doing voluntary activities varies greatly across the Member States, and some of these lack a clear legal framework for voluntary activities to promote the growth of volunteering activities and the recognition of the rights of volunteers. Volunteering plays an important role in promoting social change and solidarity between generations, helping older people make the transition from work to retirement, reducing social exclusion and encouraging young people to become more involved in society and social processes. However, in order to reap the full benefits from volunteering, we need to dismantle existing barriers to undertaking voluntary activities, particularly for young people, in the Member States and to promoting cross-border volunteering, and we need to ensure the recognition of skills and competences gained as non-formal learning and work experience. I therefore welcome the call for the Commission to take immediate action and to ensure that the European Skills Passport becomes a reality as soon as possible, ensuring greater social security, particularly for young people, and encouraging them to become more actively involved in volunteering.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I also support the idea of a ‘European Skills Passport’.

I should highlight the role which volunteering can play not only in the transition to the first job, but also from working life to retirement. I should mention that National Volunteering Week was held for the 11th time in Romania between 14 and 20 May.

      <p sl="pt">Initiatives organised for the European Year of Voluntary Activities in 2011 demonstrated the importance of volunteering, a phenomenon which involves approximately 100 million European citizens, who are able to contribute 5% of European GDP. A growing number of EU citizens of all ages participate in various areas, such as education, culture, youth policy, sport, the environment and relations with third countries. Unfortunately, the need for fiscal consolidation is endangering the financial sustainability of many non-governmental organisations, making it necessary to ensure adequate and stable funding and to simplify administrative procedures. The Member States are called on to put in place adequate legal frameworks and draw up national strategies to promote the growth of volunteering activities, whether by recognising the volunteers’ rights or improving information networks.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission is called on to negotiate easier visa regimes for non-EU citizens wishing to enter the EU, and to set up a centralised EU volunteering portal. It is worth noting the support for the Commission’s proposals to create a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and a European Skills Passport; the combination of these measures is essential for promoting cross-border volunteering. I voted for this report for the above reasons.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to explain why I voted for this report because I really am an active citizen, I believe in volunteering and sponsorship, and I believe that being influential means you should do good. Although there has been a steady increase in the progress being made on volunteering (2011 was the European Year of Volunteering), the rapporteur thinks that a clear distinction needs to be made between the value of voluntary activities which receive no financial remuneration and profit-making activities. Volunteering must continue to be supported. Creating a centralised EU volunteering portal, setting up a ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ and creating a ‘European Skills Passport’ would improve considerably the concept of volunteering and volunteering processes in general. This skills passport will therefore enable volunteering to be given public recognition (even as part of a CV, for instance), and the skills acquired will be able to be used in the future by young people in their education and working life.</p>

It has ambitious but very constructive objectives. Particularly at this historic time for Europe, we need to foster cooperation between the EU Member States and the organisations operating in them, eliminate the red tape that often hinders access to specific activities and recognise the skills that are gained through volunteering. The proposal seeks, in particular, to create a European voluntary corps and a European Skills Passport. The former would train volunteers and subsequently coordinate them, sending them, for example, to various countries to help local groups respond in the event of natural disasters. The latter will be developed based on the existing Europass model.</p>

Volunteering is an informal learning experience suitable for persons of all ages. It offers benefits in terms of personal development, strengthening of democracy, civic values and social solidarity and more active participation in democratic life, intercultural learning and the acquisition of social and professional skills, and contributes to the aims of European Union policies on social inclusion and combating discrimination, as well as on employment, education, culture, development of skills and citizenship.

      <p sl="it">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Scurria, on his excellent work. Indeed, the report addresses a vast, complex topic – the role, importance and future of volunteering in Europe – taking a structured, ambitious approach. Apart from some caveats, such as the one relating to paragraph 9 of the provisions, I think that the report should be adopted for its value as a principle and for a number of references that it contains and points that it stresses, which deserve attention and constructive follow-up action. I would emphasise, among the many requests, the call to recognise a skills passport as a means of certifying voluntary activities.</p>
      <p sl="it">With a view to achieving subsidiarity and sustainability, volunteering is already an important element in the welfare and personal services system, which state apparatuses will only be able to provide to an ever-smaller degree in the future. Today, volunteering therefore has an educational value that is vital for full and aware contemporary citizenship. It is important to promote transnational mobility as an educational tool in general and, in particular, as a first step towards gaining knowledge and entering a labour market that increasingly spans the continent. Lastly, I believe that greater mobility in volunteering also means more healthy competition, a greater exchange of ideas and increased supply, not just between NGOs, but also when we compare the ways in which Member States capitalise on these civil society resources.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this report. 2011 was the ‘Year of Volunteering’, enabling the Commission and the European Parliament to examine the issues of voluntary activities in Europe. Volunteering is an indispensable tool for actively supporting society and keeps the principles of solidarity and democracy in Europe alive. Voluntary activities represent 5% of global GDP: they thus represent real added value to European policies. It is therefore our duty to promote this sector in the future, to adopt a clear legal framework and to simplify administrative procedures. In this respect, I support the various actions proposed, in particular, establishing a centralised EU portal on volunteering and creating a ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’. A key measure of this report is the development of a European Skills Passport. I think it is important to value the personal and professional skills acquired during these citizen engagements.

      <p sl="cs">I regard volunteering as a source of informal learning and personal development. Cross-border volunteering in particular is an opportunity for the intercultural enrichment of young Europeans. Major sporting events involve an ever-increasing number of European countries in the joint organisation of events, involving thousands of volunteers from various Member States. The need for volunteers also arises, unfortunately, from the natural and environmental disasters that frequently afflict Europe and often have an impact on several Member States at the same time. Volunteers offer help, labour and solidarity, but, in addition to the difficulties caused by the disaster, they also face problems due to language barriers and red tape, and these can be reduced through appropriate European support policies. The need to continue to differentiate clearly and unequivocally between the value of volunteering, provided free of charge, and profit-making activities, still remains, as does the vital need to emphasise the role of volunteering in promoting the principles of identity and common European values, such as solidarity and social cohesion, within the EU and beyond. Following the visibility acquired through the European Year of Volunteering, it is necessary to focus on various specific measures to promote voluntary activities, such as the idea of establishing a centralised EU portal on volunteering with a specific section dedicated to cross-border volunteering, creating a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and developing the European Skills Passport.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Year of Volunteering in 2011 contributed to an evaluation of volunteering as an example of active citizenship that deserves maximum levels of support from organisations and institutions in the individual Member States and from the EU. I support the idea of cross-border cooperation in volunteering. It is the only way to transfer experience, different values and new ideas in the area of active citizenship. International cooperation in volunteering should be stepped up, and the free movement of volunteers between individual Member States should be facilitated. This ought to improve cooperation, for example, in cases of natural disasters or in international congresses of young people. Cross-border cooperation contributes to the exchange of active citizens between individual EU states and supports the acquisition of knowledge abroad, leading to individual volunteers identifying themselves more as members of European civil society. For these reasons, I voted in favour of the report on cross-border voluntary activities in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">This measure calls for a relaxation of visa policy and demands more funding programmes to ensure volunteers have access to social security benefits when in another country. It is essential during times of austerity that matters such as funded volunteering are a national prerogative and are determined on a needs only basis, not imposed centrally at EU level. It is a method by the European Commission to mask the true extent of youth unemployment in afflicted Member States, yet simply shifts the economic toll onto other countries without tackling the real issues at the crux of the problem. It is also my belief that the determination of who lives and works, albeit in a voluntary capacity, and who is entitled to welfare is a matter of sovereign consideration.</p>

      <p sl="it">The communication from the Commission on EU policies and volunteering: Recognising and promoting cross-border voluntary activities in the EU, was an excellent starting point for the preparation of the report that we have adopted today, which praises the role of volunteering in the EU. The report envisages the establishment of several positive instruments, including a portal informing citizens of volunteering opportunities in the various Member States and how to participate in them, a European Skills Passport so that the skills acquired through volunteering may be officially recognised, and measurement of volunteer work based on the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Manual and the United Nations’ Handbook, with a view to obtaining comparable statistics and data providing a clear picture of the significant contribution made by volunteering and of the needs of volunteers throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Volunteering plays an important role in European economic and social sustainability. It echoes the fundamental values of justice, solidarity, inclusion and solidarity upon which the European Union is based. The success of the European Year of Voluntary Activities in 2011 was evident, and we now need to pave the way for the growth of volunteering activities which directly contribute to the core objectives of EU policy, such as social inclusion, employment, education, skills development and citizenship. As well as making people more tolerant, it creates human and social capital and plays a vital role in the areas of aid and humanitarian cooperation, whether in post-crisis or disaster situations, or in cross-border sustainable development. I therefore argue that the Commission and the Member States should promote volunteering activities by establishing a clear and adequate legal framework for volunteers, and by eliminating bureaucracy and obstacles through, inter alia , easier visa regimes for non-EU citizens wishing to enter the EU for the purpose of volunteering, the creation of synergies with existing organisations, and the creation of the centralised EU portal or European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Volunteering, as one of the basic principles of the EU, enhances social skills and competences, and thus contributes to democratic development. It facilitates the reinforcement of social solidarity and offers a wide range of experiences, and is therefore for the benefit of not just the volunteers but also the communities involved, and society as a whole. It is clear to us that these voluntary activities, undertaken by individuals on their own volition and motivation, without the intention to make a profit, have positive effects at national, regional, local, as well as European level. Thus, volunteering plays a very important role in the realisation of social capital and development. This type of participation in democratic life solidifies civil values. This is why I find it important to emphasise the elimination of persistent barriers, as indicated in this report, namely, that the national legal systems of certain Member States do not or only partially recognise the practice of volunteering.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are all aware that due to the economic crisis, voluntary organisations do not have sufficient resources to be able to obtain funding under existing EU programmes. In order for the actors involved to be able to make better use of their cross-border projects, they must be made aware of existing European programmes, in particular, the programmes of ‘European territorial cooperation’ within the cohesion policy, and a national strategy providing an appropriate legal framework for volunteers needs to be established as well.

It also stresses the importance of ensuring that skills and knowledge gained by volunteers during their work should help them find jobs and receive due recognition as part of their working experience.

      <p sl="pt">The most basic definition of volunteering is goodwill in action. It is offered without charge, and it is generous, freely given and without strings. It is also an essential pillar of any society, as the work of thousands of volunteers, acting in a formal or informal capacity, in various areas, makes a difference to thousands of lives every single day. There are currently 100 million European citizens working in various voluntary activities, which is an incredibly large number. The rapporteur now proposes improving the conditions for volunteering with the creation of a centralised EU volunteering portal with a specific section dedicated to cross-border volunteering, creating a ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ and developing a ‘European Skills Passport’. I broadly agree with the ideas presented by the rapporteur, which are in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has always looked upon volunteering as a matter of policy, recognising its undeniable social dimension and seeking to present concrete proposals to help volunteers, giving them the dignity and recognition that they deserve.

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Mr Scurria, follows the Year of Voluntary Activities in 2011, and concerns the need to recognise and promote cross-border voluntary activities in the European Union. In a European Union seeking increasing brotherhood and solidarity, cross-border volunteering is increasingly important, especially if we take into account the economic and financial crisis we are experiencing and the lack of prospects of it coming to an end any time soon. Above all, I would highlight the importance that European institutions want to give this work, with a view to recognising the creation of conditions for citizens to dedicate themselves to this noble cause in any of the following areas: society, the environment and heritage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As there can be no voluntary work without organisations, it is essential to adopt a legal framework promoting and encouraging the activities of non-governmental organisations, in particular, by exempting them from VAT, simplifying procedures and creating a volunteer passport. As I am aware that a big world is made up of small daily acts, I am voting for this report, and I call on the Member States to encourage volunteering and to measure its impact on the economy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report is extensive and details many different issues relating to volunteering. We greatly value volunteering and, without downplaying its importance and potential, we do not entirely agree with the perspective presented on volunteering, essentially what it implies in terms of the state’s decreased responsibility for and neglect of the role of public policy in a wide range of areas. Certain risks that the concept of volunteering will be distorted or subverted are not properly addressed. Volunteering cannot, under any circumstances, be used to justify or legitimise situations involving decreased state responsibility, such as teaching that is lacking or deficient in schools, or to extort free work from young people, adults or older people. Nonetheless, we are pleased that almost all the amendments tabled by our group have been accepted. It is important to address problems experienced by volunteers and by NGOs promoting volunteering, in particular, difficulties with funding, bureaucracy, and a lack of recognition for activities carried out. The report has some good paragraphs on increasing funding for associations, communities and others. However, we would distance ourselves from proposals like the European Statute for Associations, under the terms set out here.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report on cross-border voluntary activities in the EU. Following the visibility acquired through the European Year of Volunteering, it is appropriate to focus on specific measures to further promote volunteering. The ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ will train people engaged principally in cross-border volunteering. Its creation will make an invaluable and much-needed contribution to society, demonstrating the need to build a Europe based on respect for fundamental rights and the creation of solidarity and welfare, not just within national borders and not just in economic terms. In a constantly changing society such as that in Europe, enhancing solidarity is an asset. It enables us to address and overcome human, social, intergenerational and environmental needs and concerns. Today, the EU has 100 million volunteers who are helping to make Europe and the world a better place, and I am certain that this number is set to rise substantially.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Volunteering is an informal learning experience suitable for persons of all ages; it offers benefits in terms of personal development, strengthening of democracy, civic values and social solidarity. It contributes to the aims of European Union policies on social inclusion, combating discrimination, and increasing employment. It helps to tackle human, social, environmental and intergenerational concerns. Volunteering is an essential activity for the development of democratic values, human dignity and equality. It can often ensure the swift provision of aid when natural disasters occur. Approximately 100 million European citizens work in various voluntary activities. Around 80% of citizens consider volunteering to be an important element of democratic life and a significant means by which each individual can participate in society. Nevertheless, I would like to point out that volunteering must not be an alternative to regular, paid work and must not constitute a reason for the governments of Member States failing to fulfil their social obligations. The promotion of volunteering should not result in volunteering becoming a mandatory requirement. 2013 will be the European Year of Citizens and even in this context, I firmly believe that the promotion of volunteering in the life of European citizens has its place and is extremely important.</p>

There is a European dimension to the voluntary sector. There are, in fact, approximately 100 million European citizens participating in various voluntary activities. It is important that the EU does its part to encourage and strengthen cross-border volunteering, which is an important instrument for improving social cohesion, enhancing integration and solidarity and building a European identity.

      <p sl="en">Volunteering activities are essential for encouraging citizens to be active in their societies, for enhancing integration and promoting democratic values. In Europe, according to figures from the European Commission, over 100 million Europeans are engaged in voluntary activities; three in ten EU citizens claim to be active in a voluntary activity and close to 80% of respondents consider volunteering an important part of democratic life. In addition to having a clear social impact, volunteering activities also have an economic impact as volunteers can improve their working skills and widen professional qualifications. In fact, voluntary activities alone can add to the production of 5% of European GDP. To continue supporting volunteering activities in Europe, the current report calls on the Commission and the Member States to set a legal framework and define clear rules for volunteering and volunteers in and between Member States. The report suggests using existing programmes, such as the Cohesion Policy and CEV, along with new schemes, such as tax breaks and the ‘European Skills Passport’, to facilitate and promote activities across Europe. Implementing this report could accelerate efforts to build a social and economic citizens’ Europe and therefore I voted in favour of it.</p>

Our report also suggests introducing an online information portal on issues related to volunteering. 100 million European citizens are currently working in voluntary activities. Volunteering offers an incredible opportunity for exchange and learning, and cross-border volunteering offers great potential for education, employment and citizenship, to improve mutual understanding and help develop a stronger European identity.

      <p sl="de">Those volunteering organisations that operate across borders, in particular, currently face major challenges, including in terms of administration. I therefore very much welcome the fact that this own-initiative report promotes the simplification of administrative procedures and tax breaks for those organisations involved in voluntary activities.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour because the Commission is encouraged to make the European Skills Passport a reality as soon as possible because skills acquired during volunteering work are also of considerable significance in working life and provide added value to a CV, and it is clear that volunteering can help young people in their choice of a career. The European Skills Passport will provide for the cross-border recognition of professional skills while making it possible for a record to be kept of competences and skills acquired through volunteering. The passport will be based on the Europass model (European on-line CV) to allow skills to be recorded in a transparent and comparable way: what is required is greater public recognition of volunteering as a useful experience for young people with the aim of acquiring skills that can be used, for example, in education and in work. Volunteering is an important factor in creating social capital, encouraging development and promoting socio-economic cohesion, given the potential of non-formal learning opportunities to help volunteers gain skills that will make them more employable and thus contribute to the Europe 2020 growth strategy.</p>

In addition to evaluating the report, the Committee on Culture and Education also made recommendations on promoting and facilitating voluntary activities, especially in cross-border situations. I supported this report, both at committee level and in plenary, because I feel that it provides considerable added value, even though it is still only an own-initiative report. The points which it contains are fundamental to the efficient operation of the EU’s volunteering programmes. It stressed the need for funding, both via its own programmes and the Cohesion Fund, as well as for liberalising the visa scheme for non-EU citizens who are interested in doing voluntary activities in the EU.</p>

Nevertheless, we know that their main problem is landing their first job, as they are often rejected on the grounds of a lack of experience. However, many get involved with voluntary activities.

      <p sl="fr">It is from this perspective that the Scurria report calls for a European statute for volunteering, for official recognition of qualifications obtained through volunteering, and for the creation of a skills passport that is valid throughout the EU.</p>

I would like to express my thanks in this regard to the rapporteur, Mr Scurria, and to congratulate him on his report. I believe that one of the most noteworthy issues covered in the report is the European Skills Passport, which would serve as evidence of the skills that individuals have acquired while volunteering. I am sure that this tool is a key step towards greater public recognition of volunteering, since it will not only help to raise professional qualifications and thus increase employment chances for volunteers, but also be a major incentive to undertake voluntary activities.

      <p sl="it">I voted for Mr Scurria’s report since I believe that it has set important goals for voluntary activity. Although this activity accounts for 5% of European GDP and involves approximately 100 million people in the EU, it has not yet been regulated at EU level. Volunteering is a valuable activity in human, social and economic terms, given that it complements the welfare policies of the individual Member States. In this regard, a transnational approach to regulation of this activity is highly desirable. I think that it is equally important to highlight the positive effect that volunteering has on young Europeans, especially in terms of professional and personal growth, by expanding the frontiers of the generations who will be called on to lead Europe in the coming years.</p>

We need merely to harness the human and social energy and the thousands of ideas of all these volunteers. Statistical studies show that there are around 115 million volunteers in the European Union alone. It is apparent that this represents a huge potential which should be sought out, nurtured and promoted. It is also interesting that three quarters of employers prefer to employ candidates with volunteering experience on their CVs.

This will be another important occasion to reflect on the value of volunteering in everyday life and to give older people the chance to make their own contribution to the growth of solidarity in the community. In light of the many initiatives and debates during 2011, it has been shown that voluntary activities are a tool for individuals and associations to tackle human needs and concerns, whether social, intergenerational or environmental. Emphasis has been placed on volunteering as an expression of active citizenship in all spheres of social life and as an essential activity for the development of democratic values, human dignity, equality and subsidiarity.

Based on the excellent measures presented by this report, I think that it is extremely useful to create an EU portal with a section devoted to cross-border volunteering, not to mention set up a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps which will select and train people to intervene in the event of natural disasters. Last but not least, introducing a European Skills Passport which is valid for every Member State will offer due recognition for professional qualifications and the skills acquired through volunteering.

Volunteering is not only a wonderful gift, but also brings benefits to those who offer their services, as, thanks to this, they are able to personally develop and influence events in society, whilst gaining new skills and experience in previously unfamiliar areas. I would like to highlight the positive impact of volunteering on the strengthening of democracy, human rights and civic values, education and culture, and also in combating discrimination and unemployment. Volunteering is simply all about ordinary people being able to accomplish extraordinary things. In the twenty-seven Member States of the European Union, there are around 100 million volunteers and it is estimated that their work contributes up to eight per cent of GDP.

Volunteers make an inestimable contribution to major sports events, just as volunteer fire brigades make an immense contribution to firefighting. In the social sphere, many assistance services would be impossible without the countless hours put in by volunteers. Given the fact that not even the EU emergency number is well enough known, for instance, in the case of a child abduction, it seems to make little sense to introduce a dedicated EU portal for volunteering. Furthermore, the establishment of a ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ and the development of a ‘European Skills Passport’ will most likely only result in additional bureaucracy and enormous costs, for which reason I voted against. It is much more important that we should tackle the detrimental effects of the Working Time Directive on voluntary activities, such as on volunteer firefighting – which, under the case-law of the European Court of Justice, is defined as working time in the form of on-call time and readiness for work – so that volunteers in numerous voluntary organisations can once again carry on their work legally.</p>

      <p sl="it">Volunteering is a vital resource in our society: there are approximately 100 million volunteers working in Europe who are also accounting for 5% of European GDP. It is therefore easy to see the importance of encouraging and promoting the development of this culture, which focuses on helpfulness and generosity towards others. The report mentions the need to coordinate these activities, including by creating cross-border exchanges, and evaluates the establishment of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, intended to operate mainly in the case of natural disasters and major events. The development of a European Skills Passport could no doubt be useful as well, since it provides guarantees regarding the professionalism and skill of people working as volunteers. For all these reasons, and in view of the immense and valuable service that volunteers of all ages perform on a daily basis, I decided to support this proposal in the hope that it will further stimulate this fundamental sector.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Volunteering both in Europe and throughout the world is becoming ever greater in scale. Young people are choosing volunteering for various reasons, both to help those who need help and to expand their horizons and improve their skills, thus improving their future chances of entering the labour market for the first time or returning to it. Unfortunately, bureaucratic or other restrictions do not always allow volunteers to properly exploit their opportunities. It is therefore very important to reduce bureaucratic barriers, which impede volunteering outside a person’s Member State of origin. The inclusion of all voluntary work in the overall period of employment would also be a particularly important step.</p>

      <p sl="sk">After the success achieved in 2011, which was the European Year of Voluntary Activities, the European Parliament decided to continue its legacy. It is important to build a consistent EU dimension for volunteering, which would support the development of this field. It is worth noting that more than 100 million European citizens across all Member States and from all age groups are engaged in volunteering. Volunteering is a great source of informal learning, and cross-border volunteering in particular opens up the opportunity for intercultural enrichment for European citizens of all ages. Volunteering is gradually assuming the role of catalyst for social change and is an indispensable tool in the active support of society. As well as being an expression of active citizenship in all spheres of social life, volunteering is also an important tool for the development of democratic values, human dignity, equality and the principle of subsidiarity. It is for these very reasons that I, together with the S&amp;D Group, actively support this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">European action on volunteering is necessary. We have to support this comprehensive instrument which promotes European values, intercultural exchanges, the learning of languages, youth employment and active ageing. I consider harmonisation of cross-border volunteering in the EU as important as the Erasmus programme for higher education. In order to promote cross-border volunteering, Member states should apply the same approach. Volunteers need European recognition of their experience, of their new skills, with respect to their work. I support measures proposed by the rapporteur to create a ‘skills passport’ and to include acquired skills in the ECTS. Support for volunteering organisations is necessary as well and I welcome the measures proposed in this document.</p>

      <p sl="it">Last year, 2011, was the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. The EU allocated funds and carried out awareness-raising campaigns to develop peoples’ sense of civic duty to engage in this very important social activity. The lessons learnt from this have been brought together by Mr Scurria in a report on cross-border voluntary activities, which has been adopted by Parliament. The aim of the Committee on Culture and Education is to promote the establishment of an EU portal dedicated to cross-border volunteering, which will not only carry material on jobs and social integration, but will also act as a stimulus for the creation of a qualified, organised humanitarian aid corps, a proper professional body of volunteers serving people in difficulty.</p>

I am pleased to see that all the initiatives organised for the European Year of Voluntary Activities in 2011 have helped to demonstrate the importance of volunteering, a phenomenon involving around 100 million Europeans, who are able to contribute 5% of European GDP. The times in which we live and the need for fiscal consolidation are endangering the financial sustainability of many non-governmental organisations, making it necessary to ensure adequate and stable funding and to simplify administrative procedures. As such, Parliament is urging the Member States to contribute to that end. I would also highlight the call for the Commission to negotiate easier visa regimes for non-EU citizens wishing to enter the EU, and to establish a centralised EU volunteering portal.

I would say that it is Europe’s duty to promote and raise the standing of this activity among our citizens. In terms of the creation of social capital and cross-border development, I must stress that by promoting volunteering, the European Union can grasp a precious opportunity to assert and give form to the solidarity and socio-economic cohesion that inspired our founding principles. To that end, I agree with the creation of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and the introduction of instruments providing for greater recognition of the professional skills acquired.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In recent times, European citizens have become more aware of the importance of voluntary activities. This awareness is evident in the increasing numbers of citizens involved in these activities, which not only provide personal development and cultural learning, but also contribute to strengthening civic values, solidarity and participation in democratic life. As such, Member States are called on to implement the provisions of Council Directive 2004/114/EC on the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchanges, unremunerated training or voluntary service. In the same vein, simplification of the procedures for the granting of visas to those wishing to undertake voluntary activities as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy should also be promoted. As such, it is hoped that there will be greater cooperation between volunteers from the European Union’s Member States and third countries, in particular, in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. In addition to the primary benefits associated with volunteering, democracy and the rule of law can be promoted in third countries. I voted for this report for the aforementioned reasons.</p>

Voluntary activities can help prevent social exclusion. It is therefore strange that these activities are still difficult to implement and finance at European level. The measures proposed in the report would help us to strengthen the effects of voluntary activities right from the outset.</p>

The skills passport could therefore become an essential tool in Europeans’ working lives or in their training.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, national, regional and local authorities are urged to ensure stable funding and to provide tax incentives for the organisations involved in volunteering work. Priority should be given to small organisations with limited resources and to cross-border volunteering work by facilitating access to European programmes and to funding.</p>

I voted for Mr Scurria’s report as it proposes concrete actions to promote cross-border voluntary activities in the EU; for example, the creation of a European portal that would allow for more effective cooperation between organisations active in the field of volunteering and encourage the dissemination of best practices, or the creation of a European Skills Passport, which could be very useful in that each volunteer would have EU-wide recognition of their qualifications gained through volunteering.</p>

The figures show that there is a ‘body’ of 100 million European citizens working in various voluntary activities, who are able to contribute to the production of 5% of European GDP. Eighty per cent of citizens consider volunteering to be an important element of democratic life and a significant means by which each individual can participate in society. The need to continue to differentiate clearly and unequivocally between the value of volunteering, provided free of charge, and profit-making activities, still remains. So, too, does the essential need to emphasise the role of volunteering in promoting the principles of identity and common European values, such as solidarity and social cohesion, within the EU and beyond. The report sets out many good initiatives that should be followed up and continued in future EU Years. The sets of recommendations are quite reasonable and easy to apply in the Member States as they stand today. But still, on the ‘danger watch’ side, one of the key issues should be to identify the fine lines between ‘volunteering’ and ‘working for free’!</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the wake of the European Year of Volunteering, I think it is vital that the European Parliament also takes steps forward to make volunteering European. Indeed, volunteers contribute so much in their cultural or environmental activities, their social and local work, that the need to support them is undeniable. Yet, they still face many difficulties. Three out of four Europeans believe that there should be more volunteer programmes. I therefore supported this report, as it proposes the creation of an ambitious European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, which will train volunteers and send them to do local work. On the other hand, we call for the creation of a European Skills Passport so that volunteering receives proper recognition. Encouraging European volunteering means encouraging European growth, in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy, and combating youth unemployment. This is because the technical and human skills that they acquire are all assets on the job market or for getting onto certain university courses. Lastly, volunteering can strengthen the sense of citizenship and European identity in all of us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Voluntary work, which accounts for 5% of Europe’s GDP, improves the quality of people’s lives, provides considerable added value and adds to the training of young people, who can then look forward to a better career. There are currently 100 million European citizens working in voluntary activities; this is a fundamental expression of active citizenship and an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth. Voluntary work does entail costs, however, even though it is not paid, and there is therefore a need for tax exemption.

In European border regions in particular, volunteering organisations face administrative and tax law-related difficulties if they seek to operate – in the European spirit – in multiple EU Member States.

Volunteering contributes to tolerance between people, helps the poor and those who are socially deprived or sick, but also, without volunteers, it would be impossible to organise many sporting and cultural activities.

Volunteering is an activity which instils core values in citizens, namely, the promotion of solidarity and equality, which draws out the individual’s more humanist side, through active participation in society at all levels. It is thus essential not to forget the importance of the Year of the Volunteer and the application of support measures. As such, the rapporteur proposes the creation of ‘a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ which works with already existing institutions and structures; a portal centralising all volunteering-related information inside and outside the EU; tax incentives, especially to smaller organisation with scarce financial resources; the creation of a special status for organisations which facilitate cross-border volunteering; and the creation of a European Skills Passport, which validates voluntary experience as part of informal training. Volunteering constitutes the purest form of active citizenship and a key element of citizens’ personal development. It deserves to be supported and developed.</p>

Volunteering is an informal learning experience suitable for persons of all ages, offering benefits in terms of personal development, civic values, social solidarity and participation in democratic life. We call on Member States which do not have a clear and adequate legal framework for volunteers to put one in place and devise national strategies to promote volunteering activities, including recognition for volunteers’ rights, as well as to focus on this sector when devising future policies, programmes and funding. National, regional and local authorities and the EU must pay particular attention to disadvantaged young people, especially people with disabilities, so that they can participate in volunteering activities and receive appropriate educational and financial support. We propose setting up a centralised EU portal, in cooperation with organisations and associations working in this sector, to include a database of volunteering best practice and a section on cross-border volunteering.

      <p sl="lt">The percentage of people undertaking voluntary activities in Lithuania is much lower than in other EU Member States. According to a European Commission report, less than 10% of Lithuanians volunteer from time to time, compared to 40% of Austrians, Swedes and Britons. The majority of Lithuanians who volunteer are mostly aged 15-19 and this is connected with school activities. The Lithuanian rate is also much lower than the EU average (23%). In some cases, the difference is huge – more than 15% of Irish and Finnish people volunteer in sport. In Lithuania, the rate is just 0.1%. Why is the rate of volunteering so low in Lithuania? This is partly linked to the poorly developed voluntary sector in Lithuania. A Vilnius University survey revealed that 26% of Lithuanians do not know where and how to participate in voluntary programmes. Lithuanians lack guidance and structures from those running the country who have neglected civil society. I believe that voluntary opportunities are important for Lithuanian society as an expression of citizens’ participation in all areas of social life. Voluntary activities are important for the development of democratic values, human dignity and equality.</p>

Voluntary activities allow citizens to acquire skills which make them more employable and help boost economic growth during the ongoing economic crisis, for example, by effectively limiting unemployment. It is also vital for a clear legal framework to be established at EU level regulating voluntary activities. At the same time, however, it should not be possible for volunteers to be exploited by being asked to perform tasks which could be carried out by a paid employee. In addition, it is particularly important for the Member States to adopt appropriate regulations ensuring legal security and certainty for volunteers in respect of insurance issues, since this would undoubtedly act as an added incentive for people to volunteer.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Volunteering activities face a number problems, both for the volunteers and the non-governmental organisations promoting volunteering, in particular, difficulties with funding, bureaucracy, and a lack of recognition for activities carried out. Those problems must be resolved and this report suggests some solutions. However, we cannot help but disagree with exceptions that view volunteering as an opportunity for ‘employability’, which encourages companies to promote volunteering among its employees and which supports the recognition of volunteering as a ‘professional experience’. Voluntary experience should be carried out on one’s own initiative, not due to a lack of employment. Furthermore, it should never replace jobs and job creation.</p>

      <p sl="sl">I am pleased that the vast majority of members today supported the report by the Italian MEP, Marco Scurria. Such broad political support indicates that the various political groups are well aware of the exceptional importance of volunteering to social development. Volunteering contributes to solidarity and social cohesion, to boosting civic activities, and is one of the most important forms of informal learning, as volunteers gain new knowledge and skills from the work they do. Last but not least, it is an expression of compassion for our fellow human beings – the value of which is often overlooked in the world today. Last year, which was dedicated to volunteering, also connects to this year’s European Year for Active Ageing and Intergenerational Solidarity. I agree with Mr Scurria that volunteering and solidarity are quietly taking on the role of catalysts for the social change that we need so badly. I was also pleased to endorse the report in order to support specific measures, such as the European Skills Passport and the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps. These and other measures will facilitate the work of 100 million European volunteers, bring further recognition of their contribution to society and attract new volunteers to their ranks.</p>

It urges the European Network and Information Security Agency to coordinate and implement annual ‘EU Internet Security Awareness Months’ every year. It recommends that the Commission propose binding measures designed to impose minimum standards on security and resilience and to improve coordination among national computer emergency response teams. The report also suggests that the Commission launch a public pan-European education initiative, geared towards educating and raising awareness among end-users about potential online threats.

      <p sl="pl">Technology plays an ever-increasing role in all areas of our everyday life. Millions of Europeans work using the Internet: they study, communicate and go shopping online, they do online banking and manage their domestic finances online. As online activity increases, so do threats to Internet security, which has become a priority for EU policy. Today, over 75% of households have Internet access and 36% use the Internet for banking. The issues of appropriate safeguards and building trust in online services must therefore be treated seriously and must be regulated at EU level. The 2008 directive on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the creation of the European Cybercrime Centre, which will begin its operations in January 2013, provide a solid basis for further action to improve the security of our citizens in cyberspace. The European Commission estimates that every day, about 1 million people become victims of cybercrime and losses caused by this illegal international activity reach a staggering USD 388 billion. Abuse of the Internet is a common phenomenon and, even though we are talking about a virtual world, the effects are very real. For this reason, we should treat this matter as a priority. The Internet is an inseparable part of our lives, which is why regulations concerning online behaviour should catch up with the real world as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document because nowadays, with the increasing use of the Internet and computer-based technologies, the security of the Internet stands as one of the highest political priorities for the European Union and the rest of the world. The increasing use and deployment of innovative technologies, such as fast and ultra-fast fixed and mobile Internet and cellular networks, smart grids, but also Internet services, such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things, all rely on one simple, but crucial aspect – security, resilience and trust. It becomes obvious that the Internet is a critical infrastructure, and that Internet disruption might lead to substantial losses and security risks, affecting a very large number of European citizens and businesses. Furthermore, the rapid development of technology requires that prevention of the Internet attacks, remedial reactions and the resilience of the global net should be based on a comprehensive, reactive, flexible, innovative and long-term framework. This framework needs to assure an efficient interaction between governments, businesses, individuals and all other stakeholders. Last but not least, increased resilience of the Internet is only possible when an efficient system of international cooperation and international norms is in place.</p>

That is why I support the implementation of critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP) and any policy designed to ensure greater security and privacy for the sensitive data circulating on the web, so as to make the web a virtual place where one’s actions are increasingly protected by the safeguards of the real world.</p>

      <p sl="de">‘Towards global cybersecurity’ is certainly a topic worthy of a great deal of discussion, in order to achieve a sensible solution. It is of great importance for all of us, particularly in current times. Every person who uses the Internet must be protected against attacks. The ‘global security’ approach is the right way to go, as attacks from cyberspace are global in nature and do not just affect individual countries. It is therefore important to achieve consistency with international law, which will be very difficult. This is where I see the main problem. I also believe that all major databases that contain sensitive personal data, such as those of the EU and Member State governments, or those of financial and health care institutions, should be regarded as part of the critical information infrastructure, and that the protection of such data must be ensured according to the highest possible standards. Furthermore, it is also important to take the necessary steps to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, and to provide funding therefore, in order to prevent access to critical information infrastructure.

At the same time, I would like to remind you that this protection must be proportionate to other values recognised and protected by the European Union – above all, the protection of personal data and privacy.</p>

The report brings confusion: confusing critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP), cybersecurity, and the security of networks with the fight against cybercrime – and beyond.

The report therefore inserts inappropriate references to infringement of IPR. This is contrary to the Internal Security Strategy Resolution (lead: Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, voted in May 2012, rapporteur Borsellino) which explicitly states that IPR enforcement is NOT a part of cybersecurity (e.g. measures on road safety cannot and should not address the problem that cars can be misused for bank robberies).

      <p sl="lt">Cybercrime is a big problem for Lithuania – not just for our public institutions but also for ordinary citizens. The cyber attack carried out against the Bank of Lithuania a few months ago demonstrated that Lithuania has failed to learn from previous attacks on our institutions four years ago, which temporarily paralysed the government and industry. More than 55% of Lithuanians use Internet banking services and shop or plan their holidays online. As Internet use increases in everyday life, so does organised crime in Lithuania, and such crimes have an impact on the whole of Lithuanian society. According to data from a study carried out by Yahoo, Lithuania has one of the highest rates of Internet fraud in the world, alongside Nigeria, Colombia and Romania. Another new report revealed that organised crime groups sell credit card details for EUR 1, and bank account details for EUR 60. This is not just Lithuania’s problem. Around a million EU citizens become the victims of computer crimes every day. The anti-virus software manufacturer Norton estimates that cybercrimes cost almost USD 388 billion each year. As the rapporteur notes, the perpetrators of cybercrimes are invisible and often go unpunished. Only coordinated action will help stop the perpetrators and reduce cyber dangers.</p>

I believe that our aim should be to create an effective mechanism to counteract these negative developments by way of international cooperation and that rapid response teams should also be set up by individual Member States to react to specific incidents in order to minimise the effects of attacks that pose a risk to Internet security and also to provide effective protection against the unauthorised use of information and communications technology that is used by the state administration and the military.</p>

Nonetheless, we strongly disagree with adding the points made here to a set of security-oriented strategies and policies which are profoundly detrimental in terms of employment, restricting freedom of expression for these same populations. A strong link is established between these European External Action Service measures, through which it seeks, ‘on a permanent basis, to include Internet security issues in the scope of its external relations, inter alia , when designing various financing instruments’, aligning political orientation and action in legal matters with ‘US counterparts’. Moreover, it advocates coordinated positions in international forums under the aegis of the promotion of ‘core values’, in which NATO, the United Nations and the World Bank are involved, among others. Regarding these ‘core values’, it must be said that so-called ‘global cybersecurity’ is part of a new strategic NATO concept, planning to orchestrate war after war alongside and in tandem with the US, its main partner, justified by a range of political and geostrategic arguments.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report because the European Union needs to successfully achieve the task of diversifying sources and transport routes to guarantee energy supply security. With this aim in mind, coordination and consistency are required between external, energy and trade policy. Romania thinks that the Black Sea offers major potential in achieving energy security in Europe, providing a gateway to Central Asia and the Caspian region. One specific example of this is the AGRI interconnection project for transporting liquefied natural gas, as well as the cooperation on energy initiated with Turkmenistan. At the same time, my country supports major projects such as the Nabucco gas pipeline and the Southern Corridor because their implementation will enable not only the European energy market to become diversified, but also the current level of dependence on certain energy sources or routes to be reduced. Romania also attaches particular importance to the interconnection of energy grids with neighbouring states.

Fracking, which is the only technique used to date, does indeed pose irreversible problems and global threats to the environment, in particular, to our water supply. However, this paragraph calls for the development of new strategic partnerships in view of the development of new, unconventional energy technologies – in other words, a call to take advantage of the opportunities for exploring shale gas, a target which I do not approve of when establishing a European energy strategy.</p>

It is noteworthy that the EU imports more than 60% of its gas and more than 80% of its oil, facing increasing competition for fossil fuel resources, including from emerging countries and energy producing countries. Moreover, the EU’s dependence on energy imports is likely to increase over the next decade as its own fossil fuel resources are depleted. Experience has shown that bilateral energy relations individually established between Member States and third country suppliers and transit countries may result in the further fragmentation of the internal market rather than strengthening diversified energy supply and competitiveness. As such, I believe a fully integrated European energy market functioning on the principle of solidarity and addressing the challenges of energy supply is vital.

In addition, the EU’s dependency on energy imports could increase, in turn, in spite of the efforts to achieve energy efficiency and utilise renewable energy sources.

It is clear today that this excessive dependency constitutes a significant strategic weakness and that without a consistent, joint response by the Member States to the challenges they face, they will most likely remain restricted and further subject to external pressures. Some Member States’ excessive dependency on a restricted group of suppliers increases their exposure and weakness. The increased diversification of internal and external energy sources and the composition of national and European ‘energy mixes’, which group together energy from a large number of sources to allow for competition, should be encouraged. Such is the importance of the energy issue, which should increasingly be viewed as one of Europe’s greatest priorities. As such, effectively pursuing a common policy in this area should be encouraged.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The rapid technological development that we have witnessed in recent years has led to a significant increase in global energy consumption. In spite of a growing focus on the exploitation of renewable energy sources, the truth of the matter is that we continue to be very much dependent on so-called ‘fossil fuels’. Ms Herczog’s report deals with ‘Engaging in energy policy cooperation with partners beyond our borders: a strategic approach to secure, sustainable and competitive energy supply’. While our energy partners to the east and the south are important, the European Union must not stop buying from other markets and demanding compliance with EU criteria, especially regarding the exploitation of raw materials and environmental protection. These partners must have as comprehensive an approach as possible to guarantee stable energy flows. I voted for this report, as I am aware of the importance of the role of energy in all of these areas. I therefore hope that the EU will speak with one voice on energy and will support technological development in the area of renewable energy and installing the necessary equipment, thereby contributing to revived economic growth and job creation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This entire report is based on the idea of implementing and strengthening the internal energy market, the undeniably negative consequences of which have been exacerbated, in particular since the creation of the Energy Community in 2006, which established the internal electricity and gas market. This path cannot be disassociated from the liberalisations and privatisations which have taken this important, strategic sector of the economy away from the public sphere, with all the resulting constraints, in particular, for countries with weak economies such as Portugal. Against the current background of EU energy dependency and the trend towards population growth and consumption over the coming decades, this document does not hide its concerns about future energy supply. As far as the powers of the EU and its large corporations are concerned, it is vital to ensure this supply, not for reasons of essential public interest, but for the reason which determines its options, and indeed its actions: to continue capitalist accumulation. As such, it does not disguise its unrestrained imperialistic ambitions at the service of those who want to continue furthering the interests of the European Union and its external policy, as they have always done, and now to do so using the important instrument created by the Treaty of Lisbon: the European External Action Service.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Europe is a major purchaser of energy on global energy markets. In addition, there is a realistic assumption that global energy demand will increase by 40% by 2030, mainly in non-OECD countries. The EU’s dependence on energy imports will rise significantly over the next decade, mainly due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources. This will happen despite increasing input from renewables, energy efficiency and research into energy technologies. Global competition for fossil fuel resources from emerging economies will therefore logically intensify. I therefore believe that when defining European energy policy, it is important to focus on the pursuit of a common approach and extend our sphere of influence beyond Europe, particularly in the field of energy market rules. There is a clear need for a well-functioning internal market, and we should be promoting convergence with our neighbours, especially in the field of regulation. I firmly believe that the EU’s high and increasing import dependency calls for a policy that fully reflects this current development. This policy must be based on solidarity, strategic cooperation and on the promotion of indigenous renewable energy sources.</p>

As highlighted in the report by Edit Herczog, the EU’s dependence on energy imports is likely to increase over the next decade. In light of this situation, Europe must establish a strategy for cooperation beyond its borders in order to secure its energy supply. Indeed, if the EU as a whole, as a major energy purchaser, defends a common position in this area, it could reap benefits for its interests in the negotiations with border countries. In order to strengthen their geopolitical independence and energy security, the Member States must promote a genuine internal energy market that can withstand external pressures. A secure energy supply also requires diversification of suppliers. In order to diversify its energy sources, the EU must continue to build the infrastructures provided for in the Energy 2020 strategy.

      <p sl="sk">A sustainable energy supply is essential for economic development. Energy is therefore one of the strategic areas requiring tactical negotiations focused on security of supply and sustainability. A proper energy mix, in which renewable sources of energy are beginning to break through, along with energy efficiency and other small-scale solutions, do not, however, form part of a comprehensive response to the issue of energy dependence of many Member States on energy supplies from outside the EU. In my opinion, the European Union should not only cultivate its relations with its traditional partners, such as with Russia, but should gradually establish a deeper strategic energy cooperation with the littoral states of the Black and Caspian Sea, the Middle East, the Mediterranean and Central Asia. Naturally, we must also not neglect improvements to the functioning of the internal market in which, unfortunately, many obstacles to competition remain, thus undermining the attractiveness of the EU market in the eyes of non-EU suppliers and investors. I agree with the view that the EU and its Member States must ensure an internal energy market that can withstand external pressures and attempts to use the supply and price of energy as a tool of foreign policy pressure. For this reason, I am of the view that when planning the EU budget, resources should be increased in relation to projects interconnecting the energy markets in the EU and for improving European gas and electricity infrastructure networks.</p>

Collaboration in the subdomains of energy policy, for example through joint procurement, in order to obtain favourable conditions, could certainly make sense, yet on principle, I cannot vote in favour of further national competences being handed over to Brussels. This is all the more so the case since – as the past has shown – the EU has a tendency to acquire competences via the back door. It is also impossible not to get the impression that the liberalisation of the energy market has not brought with it anything like what the EU promised. Not only do the subsidies vary sharply, in the energy field in particular, as the Member States favour different energy sources – some favour environmentally friendly technologies, others nuclear power – there is also a sharp variation in respect of different focuses when it comes to energy infrastructure.

This impact is also felt in EU Member States. When cooperating with third countries, it is therefore important to aim to ensure that they comply with the relevant environmental standards. Above all, I am talking about nuclear energy, the environmental impact of which can be catastrophic in the event of an accident. One of the most important issues of the EU’s cooperation with foreign partners in the field of energy is therefore the guarantee of a high level of nuclear security that satisfies EU standards when new power plants are constructed, or existing ones are renovated or simply operated in third countries.

      <p sl="en">Against. A general problem is that the report fails to acknowledge the need for the EU to take a different approach to energy security. It is instead enforcing the somewhat mistaken point of view that the EU (now and in the future) is a heavyweight on the international energy market and that the solution to increasing concerns regarding security of supply should be handled by securing fossil imports through diversification of sources and routes via the expansion of import infrastructure and a convergence towards more EU-coordinated contract negotiations. The serious problem of the EU’s increasing dependency on fossil imports and the necessary means to avoid this negative development is only briefly focused on in the report. Specific proposals from the Greens to address these issues by focusing on a strategic alliance on green technologies with nations in similar import-dependent situations and/or with a green agenda was blended in the compromises into poor wording on cooperation on clean coal, CCS and nuclear and fusion research (there is also a specific paragraph welcoming ITER, of course). In addition, the suggestion that more room and resources should be given to renewables, energy efficiency, smart grids and energy poverty in the Energy Community Treaty Secretariat was rejected in the vote.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Union is one of the largest energy importers in the world. I believe, therefore, that if it coordinated the various negotiating positions with third countries, it could increase its bargaining power as a major purchaser. It needs to adopt a common approach in this area so as to extend its sphere of influence beyond the borders of Europe, especially in terms of the energy market. What the European Union needs in this respect is a market that can create competition among its external partners and promote convergence with its neighbours.</p>

      <p sl="it">Having taken part in the working groups engaged in laying the foundations for a common energy policy, under the guidance of the previous President of this House, Mr Buzek, it is only natural that I support this own-initiative report on energy policy cooperation. If the European Union could coordinate energy purchases, including oil and gas, and represent the buyers in dealings with third countries, it could get much more favourable terms and more guaranteed supplies. The important point is that the decision to grant the EU such a role must be made independently by the Member States, which, under the Treaty, are entirely responsible for energy supply. Ensuring reliable and competitive access to energy supplies is fundamental for Europe’s competitiveness and for maintaining the best possible bargaining position with regard to third countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">The subject of energy security is vitally important in the policies of the European Union. The EU spends over EUR 400 billion on energy imports every year, and so its dependence on third countries is self-evident. Coordinating the Member States; diversifying energy suppliers, routes and sources; extending Europe’s sphere of influence beyond its borders; sharing information on energy data and projects in third countries; and developing partnerships with suppliers and international organisations are the key points on which the new European energy policy should be based. If we put these guidelines into practice alongside everything the European Union is doing in terms of energy efficiency and developing new forms of energy, we will be in a position to achieve a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy. Much remains to be done before we have a proper common energy policy, but there is no doubt that Parliament intends to move firmly in that direction.</p>

      <p sl="it">Energy is a shared asset of the citizens of the Union, amongst other things, but, in the last decade, it has become a foreign policy tool. Europe’s dependence on the global markets for its energy supplies puts it in a weak position but, at the same time, provides it with bargaining power. If the whole Union used this role in a coordinated manner and took a firm, common negotiating position with third countries, we would nearly always be in a good bargaining position on the demand side. By adopting this report, we are underlining the importance of finding a common approach in our dealings and dialogue with countries beyond our borders, not only in terms of competition but also in promoting regulatory convergence with our neighbours in line with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In September 2011, the European Commission presented a communication on security of energy supply and international cooperation entitled ‘The EU energy policy: engaging with partners beyond our borders’. I am voting for this report, as I believe that the EU must adopt a strong and effective position on the international stage, ensuring the energy it needs for the economic activities in which it is engaged. At a time when Europe imports more than 60% of the gas and more than 80% of the oil that it consumes, better internal coordination and efficient cooperation with its various international partners is important. In order to increase energy sustainability and reduce Europe’s dependency on certain international actors, I consider it important to diversify suppliers and sources of energy supply to the EU and it will also be necessary to promote new forms of energy exploitation, with a special emphasis on renewable energies.</p>

I also called for partnerships to be established with countries facing similar energy challenges, with the aim of promoting technological, research and industrial cooperation, and for common standards to be set for renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, electric vehicles, new and unconventional energy technologies and safety of offshore drilling operations, as well as for nuclear safety and non-proliferation. I should emphasise the geostrategic position of the Black Sea region in terms of diversification of sources and routes, and renewable energy potential. In this context, I should highlight the importance of the Southern Corridor, the Nabucco project and the Trans-Caspian pipeline, as well as other smaller projects.

      <p sl="bg">I voted in favour of Edit Herczog’s report and of reinforcing the consistency and coherence in the EU’s external energy relations, as well as of strategic and political harmonisation among Member States in negotiations with powerful energy suppliers from third countries. I support the EU having a strong, united voice in external energy relations, enabling it to defend the interests of European consumers and our economy’s competitiveness. We need a well-connected internal market which can, united as one, withstand external pressures and attempts to use energy supplies and prices as a means of exerting political pressure. Diversification of supplies enhances energy security, but only if accompanied by competition between supply sources, which includes increasing the share of liquid gas. Competition needs to be increased in the internal gas market and the price of gas must be decoupled from oil prices, which is hampering the normal operation of the gas market and is a factor sustaining the artificially high price of natural gas. I welcome the setting up of an information exchange mechanism for intergovernmental agreements with third countries in the energy sector, as well as the role of the views of the Commission on these agreements, which will guarantee uniform compliance with European legislation on the internal energy market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The EU’s energy security is a strategic and vital issue. Lacking natural resources, the Union relies heavily on its foreign partners for its supply. I therefore voted for this report, which underlines the need for extensive energy infrastructures that are interconnected with neighbouring networks. That is the goal of the future trans-European energy networks. I also believe that the EU must encourage and support cooperation with its partners on innovative projects, such as the Mediterranean Solar Plan and DESERTEC. Strengthening coordination with our partners, promoting a more diverse energy mix, in terms of both its composition and our suppliers, and ensuring energy sustainability are some of the ways in which we can guarantee a policy that meets the needs of European citizens and businesses. Our partnerships with third countries are crucial and I supported the creation of the Strategic Group for International Energy Cooperation. We must now develop an ambitious cooperation dimension, especially in order to ensure the environmental transition. If we want to ‘green’ our economy, but our energy depends on our partners, we need to convince them to develop clean, renewable energies. Those partnerships will thus benefit Europeans, third countries and our planet.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Energy security is one of the most important aspects of the European Union’s economy. At present, EU countries import about 80% of their oil and 60% of their natural gas requirements. This situation demonstrates the enormous degree to which the European Union is dependent on its suppliers from outside Europe. Unfortunately, ‘green energy’, which is becoming ever more popular, has not so far contributed to any decrease in the dependence of EU Member States on outside suppliers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, joint action by all EU Member States is essential in order to make the European Union as independent as possible in this respect, in the shortest possible time. For this reason, all EU political parties should support any initiative that concerns the Union’s energy security. I believe that there are two projects in particular that should receive our support. The first is the Nabucco pipeline and the second is the somewhat overlooked Sarmatia pipeline. Stable financing plus, as I said earlier, political support for these investments would certainly help to diversify European Union energy supplies and would also ensure cheap energy for the Union for many years.</p>

      <p sl="lv">The report on ‘Engaging in energy policy cooperation with partners beyond our borders: a strategic approach to secure, sustainable and competitive energy supply’ should definitely be supported. Its main objective is to improve coordination among Member States in energy policy relations with third countries, facilitating in this field the application of the common EU principles – market liberalisation, diversification of energy supply, and a single EU energy market. These goals are particularly important to the Baltic States, which, in terms of energy infrastructure, are still an isolated island, separated from the rest of the EU. The report pays great attention to the special situation of the Baltic States, particularly underlining their excessive dependence on Russian gas supplies, which account for almost 100% of the gas consumed in the Baltic States. Also important is the reference in the report to the need for each region to always have access to at least two different sources of energy supply. This principle is stated in the European Commission communication on Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond. The utmost support should also be given to the call included in the report for the EU and Member States to ensure a connected internal energy market that can withstand external pressures and attempts to use energy supply and prices as a tool of foreign policy pressure. That is why emphasis is placed on the need to increase financing for projects interlinking energy markets in the EU and to complete the European gas and electricity infrastructure networks by the end of 2015, in particular, the Baltic interconnection plan.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The facts speak for themselves. Europe imports its energy security from beyond its eastern and southern frontiers – this is the simplest way to describe our current energy policy. It is a policy that divides the European Union and makes it weaker. At some point, we shall have to start work on achieving the goals that have been set, goals that are among those mentioned in the report that was put to the vote. At present, European Union Member States import about 80% of their oil and 60% of their natural gas requirements. In itself, this is no bad thing, except that the resources exist to reduce these high levels (shale gas in Poland, the United Kingdom and Romania) and that the Union is totally dependent on imports from Russia. This fact is clearly identified as a problem in the report, particularly for Central and Eastern Europe. The solution is simple: EU energy solidarity that results, inter alia , in extra funding for projects such as the Nabucco or Sarmatia pipelines that are of strategic importance for our energy security.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This entire report is based on the idea of strengthening, analysing and implementing the internal energy market, the undeniably negative consequences of which have been exacerbated, in particular, since the creation of the Energy Community in 2006, which established the internal electricity and gas market. Against the current background of EU energy dependency and the trend towards population growth and consumption over the coming decades, this document identifies ‘solutions’ based on more of the same: more internal energy market and its full implementation as the centre of all action. It also advocates squaring the circle, by ‘ensuring and promoting security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability in a cost-effective way’, continuing the policy of exploiting the energy resources of the EU and third countries, which will be taken care of by the European External Action Service, ensuring that ‘all the EU’s multilateral and bilateral agreements [ …] fully comply with EU internal market rules’. These kinds of solutions have been exposed for what they are by those suffering their disastrous consequences, such as people who constantly see their electricity bills rising and, consequently, have increasing difficulties accessing energy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, despite the financial crisis, I do not think we should forget that the European integration project is based on values: peace, understanding, harmony, reconciliation and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are part of the genetic code of the European Union. Not only are they part of the genetic code of the European Union, but they are also laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Among the institutions, surely Parliament is the one that is most committed to defending rights and fundamental freedoms and has a total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature. Parliament has therefore given a Vice-President the responsibility for monitoring human rights; it has a body, which is the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET); it has created a new working group on democracy and electoral observation and there is always a section in its order of business dedicated to resolutions to defend human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Obviously, Parliament has distinguished itself by awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which, as you know, was founded by a person who left a legacy promoting peace, respect, tolerance and peoples living together peacefully.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, in this context, I am delighted to present this report which, in the form of recommendations, discusses the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and I would like to thank members of my political group for the prior work they have done and also thank the other political groups for their work and support.</p>
      <p sl="es">An important aspect, Baroness Ashton, is the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The representative must work to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, international justice and humanitarian law; to promote the abolition of the death penalty; and in all areas aimed at defending the causes of human rights’ defenders, fighting torture and impunity, defending women’s rights, child protection and the rights of minors, peace and security and, of course, the rejection of all forms of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="es">The EU Special Representative must work very directly with Parliament and other international bodies, and must work in a context of visibility, flexibility and coherence with the historical aspects that I mentioned at the start of my speech, Madam President. The representative must be a person of broad experience, proven ability, international prestige and, of course, sufficient professional experience in the field of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Obviously, Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Parliament does not seek to hijack the decision-making process for appointing this person, as it is up to the High Representative to make the proposal to the Council. However, in this context, I would like to highlight the particular importance of this appointment and the desire that, based on the trust and the mandate represented by the resolution that Parliament is going to adopt, you make the right appointment. This person is going to have a huge profile in defending this cause which, as I said, Parliament sees as a total and permanent commitment to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, can I say that I agree with Mr Salafranca that this is in our DNA, and I am really pleased to have the opportunity to speak again in this House on the subject of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members know, this is one of my top priorities, and I really value the opportunities to continue our discussions. May I also formally thank Mr Salafranca for the work he has done on his report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recommendation that is before this House today is a welcome contribution to the preparations for the appointment of a Special Representative on Human Rights. I give absolute credit to Parliament for championing this idea since its report in 2010. We have now reached the point where it commands a broad consensus across the political spectrum. I congratulate Mr Salafranca for delivering such an overwhelming vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).</p>
      <p sl="en">The broad consensus is the result of broad consultation. Over the past few months, my services have been canvassing opinions from this House, from Member States, Commission services and from NGOs, and that has helped to ensure that the thinking of this House is reflected in the draft mandate which I presented to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, the mandate will be broad and flexible. I want the new Special Representative to work with me to set priorities, to be able to develop the themes that Mr Salafranca has so ably put before us: abolition of the death penalty, combating the use of torture, women’s rights, children’s rights, and to ensure that they are able to do that in the context of working collaboratively with the institutions of the European Union and, of course, to work closely with the European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="en">The mandate will be longer than usual: two years instead of one. It is the first time ever that the European Union will have appointed a thematic EU Special Representative, so I believe it is important that the mandate should be long enough to start delivering on issues that are inherently long-term issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the Special Representative will have significant experience and expertise. I am looking for somebody with an established track record, real experience in human rights and a strong understanding of European Union policy. Member States have put forward some excellent candidates, and I look forward to making a swift appointment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do want to be clear that the Special Representative will be an important interlocutor for this Parliament. You have my full commitment that he or she will be able to brief Parliament regularly, fitting in line with existing arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Special Representative will also add considerable value to our existing work, and that may take the form of leading our human rights dialogues and consultations, where it is obvious that the Special Representative should be a natural interlocutor for our partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Communications and public diplomacy will be key. They need to help us to be more visible and to promote human rights across the whole range of the European Union’s external policies. But just to be absolutely clear, I will remain personally as involved as ever, but with now, in the future, additional, high-level, expert support to work with me and with the team based in Brussels – some of whom are with us today, and to whom I pay tribute for the extraordinary work done over these last few years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Special Representative is part of the bigger package because, as you know, the Council is due to adopt a strategic framework and an action plan on human rights and democracy too. Preparation for this has taken account of input from Members of this House in line with my undertaking to engage this House throughout the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The latest of these exchanges took place today, just before this debate began, when my Deputy Secretary-General, Maciej Popowski, met with the contact group in Parliament, under the chairmanship of Ms Lochbihler. I hope that these contacts will continue and become a regular feature of our interinstitutional discussions on a more effective and comprehensive approach to human rights and democracy. I have always intended this process to be inclusive and to give the opportunity for all stakeholders in EU policy to contribute to defining our future priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I end as I began, with a thank you to Mr Salafranca for his report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the Treaty clearly states: human rights are values on which not only the EU but also the EU’s relations with third countries are based. Continuing this point of view, I should actually mention that Lady Ashton started her mandate by stating that human rights would be the ‘silver thread’ running through foreign policy. At the moment, however, the actions being taken by the EU to promote human rights externally are rather disparate, and criticism has been levelled in this Parliament on more than one occasion at the lack of coherence in this area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The aim of appointing an EU Special Representative for Human Rights is to reinforce the coherence of EU actions in this area, and we obviously must welcome such an innovation. On the other hand, as long as we deal with human rights as a separate area covered by so-called human right dialogues and not at summit meetings between political leaders, I am afraid that our credibility will continue to suffer.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Arab Spring reminded us that human rights are universal, highlighting that every individual would like their fundamental rights and liberties to be respected. This is why I think that, for the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights to be a success, apart from having the institutional framework, we need the main European and national actors to show political will in guiding their actions according to the solemn declarations made in the Treaties.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the appointment of an EU Special Representative on Human Rights has long been a strategic objective of Parliament. That is why we are delighted that the appointment of such a representative is imminent. We look forward to frequent exchanges with the appointee.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is our hope that such a position will help to ensure that human rights feature even more prominently in our external action, and will help further consolidate our credibility in this field.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU Special Representative (SR) will have to find his or her place in a complex institutional setting. Moreover, the challenges in the field of human rights are many and varied, so the appointee will have to hit the ground running.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite the plethora of competing issues, I hope that the case of Tibet will feature prominently among the priority issues to be tackled.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also, in anticipation of this afternoon’s debate, I must emphasise that the human rights situation in Tibet deserves particular attention. Freedom of conscience and belief is very close to my group’s heart. We therefore hope that the EU SR will pay particular attention to the plight and self-immolations of the monks who are subject to the restrictive policies of the Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are worried about the lack of progress and, indeed, worsening repression, and believe that we will perhaps eventually have to consider the appointment of a specific EU SR on Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="de">From an institutional perspective, the recommendation that there should be an EU Special Representative on Human Rights is obviously only one part of the ongoing review of the EU’s overall human rights strategy, where we are mobilising our potential and political will and increasing interinstitutional preparations to become even more effective on the world stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">MEPs from a wide spectrum of political groups desire to work towards some form of joint interinstitutional document, an ambitious and united declaration, much like the European consensus on development, which defines the framework of common principles within which the EU and its Member States implement their development policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to strive towards a European consensus on human rights which will set out our common vision on the promotion of human rights in the world, with concrete steps on how to achieve our goals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only as ethical partners in the field of human rights will we ever be truly effective as a Union. I look forward to working with the different institutions on this in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Lady Ashton, for many years, the European Parliament has been arguing for and advocating the existence of this Special Representative for Human Rights, this Special Representative of the European Union. We have now reached the home stretch of this marathon and there are just two key things missing in order for us to be sure that everything will go according to plan once we have appointed the Special Representative. We have to appoint a person who will be suitable for the initial period; who will be able to live up to the role of Special Representative in this initial period. Clearly, the person appointed – as our rapporteur, Mr Salafranca, said – will have to work and cooperate with Parliament. We also have to finalise their mandate. It is therefore very important, as we all know and as we all agree, to ensure that this person will not create a human rights ghetto, but rather that they will turn EU policy, trade agreements, the Member States’ bilateral relations and multilateral relations with international authorities into expressions of human rights; we agree on that.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the home stretch of this marathon towards the appointment of our Special Representative, I will focus on the areas where I think we still need to reach agreement. I cannot understand why the mandate of the Special Representative, who is the Special Representative of the European Union, still does not include a strict obligation of accountability to Parliament and I would like a clear answer – yes or no – before the mandate is finalised. They cannot be a representative of the European Union without being accountable to the Parliament of that same European Union and that is crucial: they will be accountable to the other institutions but not to Parliament. It is crucial. We want to see the Special Representative here in Strasbourg during human rights emergencies and we want to see them – this is my final question – in the Working Group on Human Rights. The second question is whether it will be possible to formalise this group and get something in writing to that effect. My thanks, Lady Ashton, for expressing your support for the existence of this working group. Now we need something in writing to that effect.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my apologies to the House and also to the Vice-President/High Representative, as I was slightly delayed at the start of the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome, and strongly and warmly support, the moves that the Vice-President/High Representative has made towards appointing an EU Special Representative for Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I am sure the High Representative said today, and as she has said on other occasions, this is the first ever thematic Special Representative to be appointed in connection with Europe’s common foreign and security policy. So when we say that we take human rights seriously and regard it as a priority, this is a very concrete instance of doing what we say. It also represents a strengthening of the commitment to human rights compared to the excellent work of Ms Riina Kionka, Mr Solana’s former Personal Representative for Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new Special Representative will deal on behalf of the High Representative with the Council, the Commission and – I am sure we will make adequate arrangements for this – with Parliament itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do want to repeat today in the debate, as we said in the resolution and in previous debates, that I would like this post to be a very high-level, visible representation of the High Representative and of the European Union, with a representative who is able to be a big player for Europe with third country governments, in the UN Human Rights Council and in discussions involving the International Criminal Court. I see this as an extremely important means of giving us much greater strength and ‘clout’ in delivering messages on human rights than we have had in the past. I see the Special Representative’s role as something that, for Europe and the European Union, will be akin to the work undertaken by the Under-Secretary for Human Rights in the United States Department of State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see this appointment as a very important opportunity to achieve that aim. If I may repeat today what I have already said in private to the High Representative: I want this to be not just another political appointment, but the appointment of someone who is eminent in their credentials on human rights and human rights law. I do not think we as a Parliament should intervene in the process of selecting candidates; I think that should be left to the High Representative, and the High Representative alone. I would, however, like someone who has a serious and unparalleled record of working in human rights and human rights law, with high-level legal qualifications in human rights, to be appointed to this post. I invite the High Representative to give that the highest priority when she makes the appointment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, promoting human rights is one of the tasks that we undertake when we become Members of the European Parliament. In our political cooperation with many countries, we often come up against problems involving breaches of these rights and this appears in various different guises. The situation takes on a special significance in relations with our nearest neighbours, which are frequently countries with European aspirations. Our overriding objective should be to move in the direction of ensuring civil rights in countries that have direct links with the European Union. A leading example of this is Belarus, which, for many years, has been governed by an authoritarian regime that brutally suppresses political opposition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We also see treatment of citizens that is contrary to international norms and standards in many other post-Soviet countries. Generally, these are the remains of a bygone era. There are also examples of abuses of power by democratically elected authorities. It is the responsibility of European diplomacy to act efficiently and effectively to improve political standards in countries where there is a common sphere of interest. The appointment of a special representative may simplify this work. However, such a person must work closely with the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and under the control of the European Parliament. This is an important condition in order to ensure a cohesive foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to point out that human rights must be promoted throughout the world in a way that respects the right to live in a traditional family and protects the values in which people believe. It is equally important to combat instances of violence against women and girls and this also applies in situations where such violence is carried out on the basis of mistaken religious beliefs preached by certain faiths.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, human rights or no human rights, will the Special Representative still get the 12 weeks’ paid holiday a year which is standard in the shambles that is the External Action Service?</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that what the EU calls human rights has the consequence that we in the UK cannot protect ourselves from Abu Qatada and his kind. Abu Qatada’s so-called human rights are sacrosanct. In the meantime, you could not care less when it comes to the victims of the European Arrest Warrant. I would cite the case of Andrew Symeou, who, at 18, was held in Greece by means of the European Arrest Warrant for almost three years, 11 months of which were in the notorious Korydallos prison. After the three years, he was let go. It had been a case of mistaken identity all along.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Arrest Warrant has caused the surrender of over 700 UK citizens or residents to harsh and alien legal systems in continental Europe. We are all at risk. I would suggest, calmly and politely – although this is a subject that makes me angry – that on human rights, you get your own house in order before posturing elsewhere. As I was about to say before I was inappropriately interrupted, in March 2010, the High Representative, like the Bourbons, has forgotten nothing and has learned nothing.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights can, and must, prove to be a beneficial move, provided – of course – that certain steps are taken. The most important is his accountability to the European Parliament. A second important point is his freedom of action or, even more, the freedom he will acquire during the performance of his duties. The European Union can, and must, highlight human rights as a question of crucial importance to the future of mankind. However, in order to achieve that, I must emphasise that we need to be firmly convinced that political expediencies will have no voice or place in the representative’s activities in connection with the vital issue of human rights. Other important points are who will undertake this job, how accountable he will be towards those who appoint him, how accountable he will be, as I said earlier, to the European Parliament and the degree to which he understands that human rights must be respected everywhere in the world and in the European Union itself. I should like to close by saying that I wonder if the representative in question will be entitled or obliged to look at the blatant violation of human rights in Member States of the European Union by countries seeking to join the Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I did actually ask a question. If I used the words ‘does my colleague agree with me’, that usually begins a question. Now for my speech.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 1776, Thomas Jefferson institutionalised the concept of human rights in the US Declaration of Independence, and today’s US Ambassadors around the world have the responsibility for projecting that concept wherever they may be. In my country, Great Britain, human rights matters come under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, but these models are apparently not good enough for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur calls for a Special Representative for this policy area, complete with his or her budget lines and dedicated staff. It is not, of course, within the realm of possibility that the existing EU overseas delegations could shoulder this responsibility. Might that eat into their four-day weeks and prolonged holiday entitlements? There are incidentally 119 such delegations. Surely, at a time of EU-enforced austerity, in situ apparatus should be used, rather than creating new, expensive departments.</p>
      <p sl="en">One aspect of the report I do agree with is that if a Special Representative for Human Rights should be appointed, they should have the necessary professional qualifications, extensive experience and a proven track record in the field of human rights, as well as personal and professional integrity and an international reputation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High Representative may feel a little embarrassed at this valid point as these criteria were clearly overlooked in her appointment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Human rights issues have been among the key issues in Parliament for a long time. Therefore, in this report, we are addressing several recommendations to the Council. I truly hope that they deserve the support of Baroness Ashton as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, the new Special Representative should have an independent and flexible mandate, allowing him or her to act swiftly and effectively. This should contribute to the enhanced visibility and effectiveness of the EU when it comes to the EU’s human rights policy. The EU’s Special Representative will also need to ensure coherence and mainstreaming of human rights issues across various policy areas. The Special Representative for Human Rights should be a high-level interlocutor for his or her counterparts in third countries and at international organisations. He or she should be able to represent the EU in multilateral fora and engage with the UN as well as with relevant regional organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to stress that Parliament will be keen to play its role in the appointment procedure, especially with regard to the hearing of the candidates, as well as overseeing the mandate during its entire term.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, despite the efforts of the European Union and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, for which we are grateful, the gap between formal recognition of human rights and their effective implementation cannot be missed. In the Howitt report which was recently adopted, we emphasised that the Union’s policy as regards the protection and promotion of human rights must be not just consistent, but exemplary.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights will strengthen democracy, the rule of law, freedom and the situation of those who defend human rights. The scope of the representative’s responsibilities should mirror the Union’s human rights policy. Of particular importance are issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, stopping the use of torture, combating violence against women and children as well as all forms of discrimination, including discrimination against disabled or LGBT persons, protection of freedom of speech – which includes the Internet – freedom of religion and beliefs, and conducting a dialogue on human rights with third countries. In connection with the increasing importance of respect for human rights in business, I support the amendment that extends the mandate of the Special Representative to include the provision of support to the High Representative and to EU institutions in disseminating UN guidelines concerning business and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, the Special Representative should work with the UN, with the Council’s Human Rights Working Group, with non-governmental and regional organisations, with representatives of every level of civil society and with experts. They must have a strong, independent and flexible mandate, and obviously appropriate funding, in order to be able to carry out their duties properly. Much will depend on the person themselves, their qualifications, experience and the trust they have gained in the international arena. The person that takes this position should be a specialist in international humanitarian law and international judicial procedures.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the European Union is the region that actively promotes the protection of human rights on a global scale, and it is a positive thing that we will now soon have an EU Special Representative for Human Rights to support this work. It will not be an easy job, either bilaterally or multilaterally, to assume a position here and to rebuff the attempts, for example, to wear down and erode the universality of human rights and produce a strong and proactive human rights policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have before us an excellent recommendation from the rapporteur, in which the many duties of the special representative are outlined, including that of making better human rights policy within the institutions of the European Union. I can assure you that we in the Subcommittee on Human Rights will assist and support this work to the best of our ability.</p>
      <p sl="de">The mandate proposed envisages enabling the Special Representative for Human Rights to brief the European Parliament. I would like to see this more clearly worded, so that the Special Representative would regularly keep Parliament informed and be available for discussion. That is a very important concern for me and my colleagues in the House.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Baroness Ashton, I wish you good luck in selecting the EU Special Representative for Human Rights.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the appointment of a Special Representative for Human Rights provides opportunities, for example, to pay more attention to a human right that is essential, but one that is under great pressure, namely religious freedom. In many countries, this freedom is rapidly disappearing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In Indonesia, the government is doing little against radical Muslims who are terrorising the Christians and Ahmadis. In Northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram terrorist group throws a bomb into a church almost every week. Unfortunately, we could name countless other examples, which is why we urgently need to pay attention to religious freedom.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Special Representative has also laid down obligations alongside those opportunities. I am thinking of human rights, of them being taken seriously in Europe’s relationships with other countries. That should be specifically reflected in our trade agreements. In India, 40 million people are trapped in a life of slavery. We cannot therefore have a trade agreement between Europe and India without a strong and effective human rights chapter.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, today’s debate is not just an idea that someone came up with in private; it is a primarily a debate about recommendations to the Council, and arises from the provisions of Article 27 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union concerning the promotion of human rights and democracy as well as Article 33 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union concerning the appointment of a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights. It is also the result of interinstitutional activities such as, for example, the debate of December 2011 on an effective approach by the entire Union to human rights and democracy. This was the outcome of our reflections on what happened following the Arab Spring.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The appointment of a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights should, above all, increase the effectiveness and consistency of European Union policy in the area of human rights, as we know that such consistency is often lacking, while ensuring an appropriate role for Parliament in the procedure for appointing the representative and in supervising the mandate that the Special Representative will have. The Special Representative should also chair high-level meetings on human rights and be a partner to third countries and international organisations functioning both on a regional and global level. The future European Union representative should be a person who commands a great deal of authority in the area of human rights among organisations and institutions working in this field. It should be a person who is recognised both in Europe and throughout the world, as only a person of this calibre will be able to ensure that human rights are given their due worth in the Union’s relations with our partners.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, there can be debate, and all kinds of views, about European foreign policy, but it is possible to say that there is one area in which the European Union has always performed excellently, including in its foreign policy, and that is in standing up for human rights around the world. Given that this is the first time that the European Union will be appointing a topic-specific representative, it is truly symbolic that it should be for this particular topic. In this area, it is not just about functionality; it is also about the signal sent out to the outside world, and this is sending a positive signal.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to functionality, clearly we do also have to discuss what the Special Representative is able, allowed, supposed or in a position to do. It is important that the mandate should be given the broadest possible form, that it is not constricted, that it is not just about issues that would occur to anyone in respect of human rights matters, but that the Special Representative should have the freedom to really decide what subjects he or she wants to concentrate on. I also approve of the fact that the mandate is relatively long, although I believe that it could be linked to the half-way point of the European election cycle, with two and a half years being a reasonable period, allowing the Special Representative a longer spell in which to dedicate himself/herself to human rights matters. The Special Representative also needs to be adequately equipped and have sufficient staff and I would like to see all that taken care of.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important to me that there should be an obligation to report to the European Parliament. The word obligation here is the right word, as we obviously have to monitor what is happening and what is taking place. I also consider it particularly important – and I have now reached the end of my speech – that the Special Representative should also not just be concerned with broad topics, but that also, for example, there could be monitoring of what European companies sometimes do outside of the European Union – for instance, in relation to human and social rights. That is also a subject that would be very interesting.</p>

For this reason, I shall vote in favour of this report. There are, of course, certain things in it that I find worrying: the concept of sexual freedom has been confused with freedom from torture, with being free, with freedom of assembly, which is what I understand as human rights.

      <p sl="de">For that reason, we have, for a long time, advocated an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The Special Representative should not be bound into tightly defined subject areas but should pursue a comprehensive approach to promoting human rights, democratic efforts and the structures appropriate for states under the rule of law. This comprehensive approach must also be discernible in the way the Special Representative for Human Rights collaborates with other actors. The success of the office will depend, to a critical degree, on cooperation with political leaders, but also, in particular, with the representatives of local, regional and national civil society and with regional and international organisations. Only with the intensive involvement of local and regional actors will it be possible for us, jointly, to durably improve the human rights picture in this world of ours.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament must live up to the role envisaged for it in appointing the supervision for the special rapporteur's mandate. I therefore expect the Special Representative for Human Rights to regularly report to us on his/her activities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the appointment of a Special Representative for Human Rights should constitute progress towards an EU external policy guided by its founding values and principles of promoting human rights and democracy, not just within Europe but universally. The Special Representative should have political experience, credentials in the field of international humanitarian or human rights law or of international justice, and should be capable of acting as an intelligent and strategic advocate of human rights, democracy and the rule of law the world over. He or she should speak on behalf of the European Union and be directly accountable to this Parliament wherever necessary, and should ensure, in coordination with the High Representative and the Member States, that guidelines, toolkits and action plans in this area are actually put into practice. He or she should be someone unafraid of speaking up and of loudly condemning human rights violations in any state, including those with which the European Union has privileged relations, thereby genuinely establishing an honest, transparent and strategic dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot continue concluding agreements and offering financial support, consequence-free and with impunity, to regimes that systematically display contempt for the fundamental rights of their peoples. Our security, trade and development, and energy policies must ensure concrete results and democratic reforms in third countries and, to that end, our external action must prioritise investment in capacity building for civil society. This means that we should work alongside civil society in each country in order to develop the human rights strategy for that country, and the specific priorities and goals of these strategies should be made public.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I hope that the Council and the Member States will commit to ensuring full cooperation with the Special Representative and will facilitate the task of coordinating the voices confronting him or her. I am sure that you will make the right choice, High Representative.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I consider it a major achievement that the post of EU Special Representative for Human Rights can finally be created, and I hope that it will not remain simply a post, but will grow into a quite significant institution. We all agree here in Parliament that the creation of this post in the EU has long been overdue. Parliament has been urging it for years.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am pleased to note that in the current draft of the Council conclusions, the originally proposed one-year period has been replaced by two years; this was, after all, one of the main points of our European report: the extension of the duration of the mandate. It takes time for the work of a new representative to produce noticeable international effect.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Furthermore, when creating this new human rights post, it is essential to define an appropriate, flexible and effective mandate, and to provide all the means necessary to allow for its implementation, as well as to ensure that there is an opportunity for the person holding the post of representative to respond to Parliament’s questions over the course of his or her mandate. The adoption of this human rights package by the Council will represent another step towards the creation of an EU human rights strategy, which I hope will promote effectiveness in this field.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms lies at the heart of the European Union; this is being proven once again by creating the position of Special Representative for Human Rights. We are living in times of great change in many countries with which the Union wishes to maintain good relations. Therefore, we need to protect and promote our values, namely, respect for the individual and human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, now more than ever.</p>
      <p sl="el">The appointment of the Special Representative will help the European External Action Service to become more effective in the human rights sector, as the Special Representative will be able to act quickly and directly. He therefore needs to be given clear instructions for his field of action, so as to avoid confusion between the relevant services of the institutions in terms of who is competent. Similarly, it must be possible to extend the Special Representative’s term of office, if he proves to be up to the job. The person selected must have a track record in the human rights sector that proves that he will be a credible interlocutor on all counts.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Treaty on European Union provides a legal basis for appointing a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights, since it states: ‘The Council may, on a proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, appoint a special representative with a mandate in relation to particular policy issues’. Right from the start, the European Parliament was in favour of taking advantage of this possibility. We have called, on many occasions, for the appointment of a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights, for example, in Parliament’s 2009 and 2010 resolutions on the annual reports on human rights in the world and the European Union’s policy on the matter. For this reason, we give our unequivocal support today to the recommendation to the Council drafted by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights and we do this wholeheartedly, as this has long been Parliament’s position.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, the fact that we are to have a Special Representative for Human Rights is extremely positive. Purely as an aside, I would be so bold as to say that it would be good if every individual country had a special minister with the title of Minister for Human Rights and Freedoms. We must nevertheless acknowledge that we have sometimes prioritised stability over human rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We also have to acknowledge that, whenever we have talked about democratisation, we have been eager to talk about multiparty systems instead of bringing up respect for human rights and freedoms in particular. There is no doubt, I am sure, that this representative will have a huge amount of work to do and will really have to tussle with one country or another. However, let us hope that this representative will truly be able to change the lives of some individuals, even if it might be difficult to tackle huge countries like China and India, for example.</p>
      <p sl="sv">After all, this is ultimately what we mean when we talk about human rights and freedoms: the rights, respect and dignity of each individual. I am convinced that a great deal more can be done, and if there is something that this Chamber ought to be known for, it is precisely the fact that political decisions should be based on human rights and freedoms in particular.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, may I first of all thank Baroness Ashton for her courtesy and the courtesies of her staff, which were extended to Members, and say how much I regret the ungentlemanly behaviour of Members of this House who use privilege to hurl abuse. It is not the role of Parliament to do that in a debate where people are not in a position to respond themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I say also that I disagree with those colleagues who put forward the view that the Special Representative for Human Rights should be a lawyer. I think the person who is appointed will have plenty of advice available to him or her, and what I want is a person who has a good heart, who is impartial, who has courage, who will show good judgment, who has energy and, above all, who is not politically correct; a person who will pursue the truth. Human rights are indivisible; they are not just conferred by law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Consensus on Development calls for the issue of gender equality to be a core part of all policy strategies within the European Union. We have missing from the world’s population today 100 million women – 100 million females – terminated by infanticide or abortion on no other basis than the fact that they were female. I do not hear anybody mentioning this in this House. I am quite appalled that it has not been mentioned in this House. I want somebody who has the courage to come to this House and talk to us about this issue in an impartial, fair, direct, honest, open way, and who will equally pursue all human rights issues because human rights are indivisible. They apply to all persons by right, and are not conferred by our prejudices or our bias.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on his excellent report, which summarises perfectly the challenges involved in creating such a post and the strict conditions that must accompany it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The appointment of a special representative is the logical continuation, on the one hand, of one of the legal pillars of our institutions, notably Articles 21 and 33 of the Treaty, and, on the other hand, of the significant progress represented by the EU’s accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If it adopts this report, the European Parliament will also be taking the opportunity to monitor the activities of the Special Representative and, thus, part of the EU’s new external policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that the roles played by the Union and by Parliament will also be strengthened as a result. However, the importance of this position is not so much the creation of the post itself, which must be held by someone honest, qualified, dynamic and determined, but the political message it will send to all third countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This message covers several levels. On the one hand, the EU’s international commitment to promoting human rights and democracy will be strengthened and consolidated. The shared responsibility of the EU and the Member States to protect and promote these rights will become stronger because it will be embodied by the Special Representative. The common security policy and the common external policy will become more coherent, effective and visible. Finally, the Union’s role as an advocate of human rights will be consolidated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I would like to stress that this post must not be a mere honorary position or the umpteenth empty shell, but a powerful mandate to move towards a freer world in which the dignity of all human beings is respected and in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that this appointment is an extremely important event or that the European Union should look after the weak and the vulnerable if it wishes to be even more real, authoritative and charismatic. There can be no doubt that choosing a Special Representative for Human Rights is an extremely valuable thing to do. My congratulations of course go to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on the outstanding work he has done.</p>
      <p sl="it">Solidarity, accountability and cooperation: the Member States that put these qualities into practice need to be consistently supported, and we also need to impose conditions favouring those third countries that show particular interest in, and pay attention to, the protection of fundamental rights. That is with regard to trade relations.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the subject of immigration, we still have a number of unresolved issues concerning the protection of fundamental rights for people who flee their native countries because they can see their interests and needs being trampled on there. We need to treat these people with great respect as well. It is a question of natural rights, rights that are inherent to the individual and closely linked to the growth of his or her personality.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union must therefore ensure that this role is fulfilled as effectively as possible. The person who is chosen must have two qualities: charisma and courage, and must believe wholeheartedly in the job he or she is appointed to do.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, action to defend and protect human rights underpins the functioning of democracy, social peace, cohesive development and smooth international relations and is therefore rightly the cornerstone of the Union’s foreign policy. The means at our disposal to date – political dialogue and trade agreements with human rights clauses – have proven to be inadequate. I therefore welcome the initiative to appoint a Special Representative for Human Rights and I support Parliament’s recommendation to the Council. I think that it will give our policy visibility and cohesiveness.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Special Representative for Human Rights must be able to acquire independence of action and the facility to cooperate smoothly with the competent services, civil society and other international and regional organisations. At the same time, he or she must be able to analyse the situation on the ground in the different countries, as reports of the real circumstances often do not reach us here in Parliament. That is why I believe that the right selection will be made. We understand the importance of protection for human rights in the Arab States to good relations and peace in the world. They are suffering, en route to democracy, from a lack of protection for human rights; the persecution of Christians is a typical example. I therefore believe that the time has come for us to give a cohesive and effective response and the appointment of this new institutional person is a step in that direction.</p>

Occasionally, it happened that when we raised a problem in the official Committee on Foreign Affairs, let us say, concerning economic cooperation with China, someone on the committee always remembered to point out that there was a special sub-committee for handling the subject that we were discussing. Moreover, the purpose was obviously not to make human rights an area that is ghettoised, passed over and excluded from the official political agenda. On the contrary, the purpose was for human rights issues to receive the attention that they deserve and actually to raise their profile.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Baroness Ashton, I was extremely happy to hear you express your wish to commit to cooperation and actually insist on it. If it were not for this approach, it would not be worth our considering the appointment of a Special Representative for Human Rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, human rights have never been more important and have not led to so many changes of government as is happening at the moment. The events in the Middle East and North Africa have demonstrated the strong link between human rights and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union obviously needs to change the way in which it responds as the states in the Middle East and North Africa are interested in seeing which solutions are applicable to the transition to a democratic state, to a state structure which also includes protection for human rights which had been affected in the regimes existing prior to the Arab revolutions. This is precisely why the future representative for human rights will have to have a robust mandate, be a key spokesperson for NGOs and minorities, cooperate with the United Nations and have consultations with third countries regarding human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the areas of responsibility of the future EU Special Representative for Human Rights are many – from the abolition of the death penalty to gender-specific issues. In my view, there are too many subject areas here for a single individual to focus on. The Special Representative must concentrate on his/her core responsibilities. Just those in human rights-recalcitrant Turkey could actually merit a special representative of their own: Sharia, the oppression of minorities in the country, the lack of religious freedom, right down to torture. According to Amnesty International, there is also no progress to be detected over the last year.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, Baroness Ashton, if you really want to achieve something, it would be a more sensible idea to concentrate on the core areas rather than attempting to be master of all trades and losing yourself in a great many details or trying to score points through pseudo action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Many Member States prosecute and imprison people for publishing heretical opinions in speech, written word or in electronic form. The freedom to express oneself is important, but not as important as the freedom to hear or read what has been said or written by others. The British Government is currently proposing a law – the Communications Data Bill – which will provide the security services with access to all of the Internet sites visited by everyone in the United Kingdom. If somebody in a sensitive government job were, just out of curiosity, to log onto a website disapproved of by a party, that person’s job would be at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">Freedom of association is mentioned in the report, but there have been bans or attempted bans on parties in Belgium and Germany. In the EU, human rights are for export only. Perhaps the person appointed as a special representative will pay attention to these matters.</p>

      <p sl="en">May I refer those who have looked into internal issues to Mr Salafranca’s report to the mandate of the Special Representative, and indeed to the mandate that I hold, which is an external mandate. I do try, wherever possible, to answer all the questions that honourable Members put forward and to follow up in writing those that I have not managed to address in the course of what is always a short winding-up speech.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am extremely conscious that, in the course of this debate, many attributes have been suggested for this paragon of virtue – the candidate who will become the Special Representative.

That is set out not only in the Treaty but in the political declaration that has been made, and it will be an important point.

It is important that we are able to review developments and respond to Parliament on that.</p>

      <p sl="es">I was personally very pleased by the speech made by Mr Mitchell regarding the profile that this person should have, which brings to mind the anecdote sometimes told about when, in fourth century Athens, after the age of Pericles, Aristotle was walking with his pupils of the Peripatetic School and one of them made an observation that displeased his teacher. When Aristotle answered, the pupil said to him, ‘that is not my observation, but that of your teacher Plato’. Aristotle’s response has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day and our technological and Internet era: ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. I believe that the Special Representative must be an integral part of the institutional structure of the European Union, report to the High Representative, have a link to Parliament and the Member States, but that what must be more dear to him or her must be the cause of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, so that human rights and fundamental freedoms, as Parliament wishes, can take hold in the 21st century across the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, our second topic today, as you said, concerns the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World in 2011. This report, which, I am pleased to say, is now on the Council website, is set to be adopted in two weeks’ time. I am very happy to present the outline of this report to the House – on time – this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The annual report shows how the EU really can make a difference when and where it matters most. The report covers 2011 but, if I might, I would like to give some up-to-date figures to illustrate what I mean. Since the beginning of this year, we have made 36 declarations or statements on behalf of human rights defenders or country situations of concern. Of course, that does not include the countless number of démarches we conduct – for obvious reasons – behind closed doors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since January, we have also conducted 14 in-depth human rights discussions with countries around the globe, with another 22 still to come this year. From Jordan to Vietnam, from Ukraine to the United States, from Argentina to Pakistan, the European Union sits down in the spirit of partnership to see how we can, together, improve the human rights situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The annual report details all of this action in 2011. But it does more: in line with the wishes of Parliament, the report contains a section on freedom of religion or belief, which is so essential to the development of free societies. 2011 saw worrying developments in this connection, with intolerance spilling over from discrimination into violent attacks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, for the first time, the report contains a section on international humanitarian law, which was the subject of various EU initiatives in 2011, culminating in the seven pledges made in November to the 31st International conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.</p>
      <p sl="en">As in previous years, the annual report catalogues our work across the whole range of thematic issues, bilateral and multilateral. It encapsulates the tremendous challenges to human rights and democracy in 2011, and how we responded.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, just a few examples to show that we stay consistently active:</p>
      <p sl="en">In Bahrain, we have been working since the events of February 2011 to encourage all sides to engage in national reconciliation. I personally expressed support for the independent commission of inquiry and the implementation of its recommendations when I met with his Majesty the King and with the Foreign Minister. We have kept a close eye on the case of Mr al-Khawaja and I have asked my officials to meet him in prison; this took place just before he ended his hunger strike. The EU is also following the fate of Mr Nabeel Rajab, who has just been arrested yet again.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Mongolia, the EU has been following the situation since the arrest of former President Enkhbayar on corruption charges, his hunger strike and subsequent release. We are determined to support the democratic process in Mongolia ahead of the elections on 28 June.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Pakistan, the EU intervened in the case of Mr Behram Khan, who has been on death row since 2003. Following the rejection of several appeals, he was due to be executed on 23 May, but after several EU appeals to the Pakistani authorities, the execution was put off. During my visit last week to Pakistan, I raised the issues of the need to protect and promote the rights of women, to abolish the death penalty and to make good on the promise of legislative changes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the package concerns human rights and democracy. Our election observation missions remain an essential tool to support democracy and accompany political change, as in the case of the historic elections in Tunisia, the creation of a new state in South Sudan, the important parliamentary elections in Algeria – with the first ever EU election observation there – and Peru, where the observation mission contributed to strengthening our bilateral relations, and, of course, many other places across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank Members of this House for their participation in these missions, adding visibility and enhancing the political commitment of the European Union. On a related note, I am happy to confirm that we are making good progress in preparing the draft statute for the European Endowment for Democracy, including on the basis of the Lambsdorff report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope you will consider the annual report a useful resource. The recent Howitt report expresses expectations that the report should evolve, and I am certainly open to exploring that idea – in cooperation with this House – to make sure that the report continues to be as relevant in the future as it is now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as the shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group, I would like to thank the Vice-President for her presence here today.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the spirit of the guiding values of the UN Charter, we take this report very seriously, and it is our priority to cooperate with the EEAS for a comprehensive strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking back at the past year, however, in spite of all our commitment, we have to face reality. Regular and systematic human rights violations continue. People face repression around the world and innocent people die every day. Yet, there is reason for hope. In spite of the aforementioned violations, we also witness increasing demand for human rights coming from the people, from brave individuals, inspired to action by the principle of human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Millions poured out into the streets to demand justice and freedom in the Arab world; courageous people in China continue showing the world that they are not afraid. They want accountability, just as those Tibetans who choose to sacrifice themselves in peaceful protest against China’s communist rule.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights defenders and lawyers continue protecting those who want to practise their freedom. We are witnessing increasing non-violent resistance, reflecting self-consciousness among people – just as Liu Xiaobo wrote in 2006 in his essay ‘Changing the regime by changing society’.</p>
      <p sl="en">His words are still of great inspiration today. Our solidarity with entire communities that rise up in spite of intimidation is crucial. We cannot force change from the outside. It needs to come from the inside and we have to stay committed in order to catalyse this change now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the High Representative for her kind words about my own report as the previous annual rapporteur on human rights. I will be working, of course, with our next rapporteur on human rights, Mr Donskis, who will speak next. With him, I know that the High Representative and her services have made a major effort to get the timetable back on track and to ensure that she herself is present to deliver this annual human rights report to our plenary. I would like to sincerely thank her and her services for restoring this important action.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to place on record that I agree with many of the conclusions of the report. This was indeed a momentous year for human rights and democracy building in which we have all – the EU included – had to step up to the task. I agree that this report, in a sense, will be the last of its kind, as next year we will be able to report and debate on implementation of the strategic review on human rights. In this context, I applaud, for example, the EU’s action to protest against the arrest of bloggers exercising their freedom of expression, the new consensus the EU has now forged in EU institutions on freedom of religion and belief, the unanimous support of EU members of the Human Rights Council for the groundbreaking resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity, the new common position on the international criminal court, and, as the High Representative has said herself, the successful EU observation missions. I would like to thank her for what she said this afternoon about Nabeel Rajab, who I know, thanks to this wonderful world of social media. I would be grateful if, in her response, she could comment about the four ICC staff who are currently detained in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, although I have been proud to contribute personally to the work of the mandate holder leading to the guiding principles on business and human rights, I would like the High Representative to charge an identified person within her services to spearhead their implementation within the European Union and to follow up the recommendations of the Edinburgh Study detailed in her last annual report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World is always a unique opportunity for the European Union, its politicians and human rights activists to give a vision of a world for which liberal democracies are ready to fight ideological battles, which would bring us closer to reality, in which cooperation and partnership between countries is based not just on economic strength, rich natural resources, security interests and wise compromises between historical and modern differences, but, above all, on the universal recognition that the value of human life, dignity and rights are crucial and fundamental criteria of a country’s civilisation and credibility and that human rights are not, and cannot be, up for negotiation or held hostage by economics.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We have had an historic opportunity to convince ourselves that the pursuit of freedom and dignity is not just an invention of the modern Western world, but that it is a universal goal of humanity, spontaneously and momentarily, even without any refined policy or philosophy, bringing humanity together throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This was the Arab Spring, the aspiration of freedom and democracy that broke through with great force, which can rightly be compared with such momentous events in our recent history as the Eastern European nations’ struggle for freedom and the great human rights movements from Andrei Sakharov and his companions in Russia to Solidarity in Poland. As future rapporteur, I will have the difficult task of trying to evaluate the lessons learnt by Europe thanks to the Arab Spring and analyse the consequences of these lessons for common European Union human rights policy in the future.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Both the Arab Spring and the other events of last year increasingly reveal the power of information technology and the importance of expression, the media and social media for democratic revolutions and democratic progress.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In my report, I therefore cannot fail to mention the important events of last year in Belarus and the very poor human rights situation in Tibet, which is a concern both for my group and, I believe, Parliament as a whole, and which must be raised at European Union level.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the Annual Report on Human Rights and the European Parliament’s cooperation with you must become an opportunity to look boldly into the future of Europe and the world because, let us be frank and let us not hide it, retrospective talk in the report taking into account the situation in the world in 2011 is tantamount to talking about the world’s future and humanity strategies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to begin by saying that I was not very satisfied by the answers you gave regarding the questions during our previous debate on the Special Representative. The full title of the Special Representative – Special Representative of the European Union – shows that they are not the special representative of the External Action Service or the special representative of the Council, and nor are they your special representative or personal representative. If they are a Special Representative of the European Union, they must be accountable to the EU institutions and be a special representative for the Union. That is my constitutional reading on the basis of the Treaties and if, as you told us, High Representative, it is already laid down in the Treaties that they will be accountable to the EU institutions, including this House, which is one of those institutions, I really cannot understand why their mandate does not include the obligation to appear before Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards the annual reports, I defer to my colleagues, both Mr Howitt and Mr Donskis, on the work they have been doing and their very praiseworthy work on monitoring the situation this year. I should like to add just one matter for our consideration. Last year was not just a momentous year in human rights terms; it was also a very important year for the European Union: it was the year when the European Union was at its weakest in terms of economic and political power; it was the year in which many of our Member States received representatives from China, Angola or other countries with human rights problems and asked them for money to pay their debts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards the strategic aspect of reflecting on how we will act as regards human rights, it is very important that Europe starts by putting its house in order and by thinking it is necessary, not just to imagine a better world, but also to come up with a more streamlined way of acting in terms of external policy. Clearly, one of the most important things – and here I am returning to the start of my speech – has to do with cooperation between our institutions, which should be reliable, documented and structured.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the Council’s Annual Report on Human Rights in the World can only be considered to be a step in the right direction in the context of the previous reports on this issue. Finally, after many years of pressure from Members of this House, as well as from many Member States, the Council’s attention has been drawn to the urgent issue of breaches of religious freedom in almost every part of the world. I very much appreciate the role that the High Representative has played in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Religious freedom is currently the most frequently breached human right in the world, with extremely serious consequences. Seventy-five per cent of such cases – from restrictions on access to schools to dramatic cases of murder on religious grounds – affect Christians. Despite this, the Council’s report avoids naming victims and instead surrenders to a false sense of political correctness. A refusal to name the victims is, in effect, yet another blow, another form of discrimination against people who are already suffering. To hide the fact that today it is Christians who are the most frequently attacked religious group weakens our position and it is a continuation of the former policy of turning a blind eye to the undermining of religious freedom.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report rightly refers to the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in February 2011. Why then is it taking a step back with regard to Christianity? Has someone forgotten that even then, some Member States did not agree with this shameful practice of deleting victims’ names? The formulation adopted at the time, stating that, I quote: ‘a growing number of acts of religious intolerance and discrimination as epitomised by recent violence and acts of terror in various countries against Christians and their places of worship, Muslim pilgrims and other religious communities’ was a good compromise. Why is this compromise being rejected today? The Council’s conclusions were adopted immediately following the bomb attack on a Coptic church in Alexandria in which 23 people died and 97 were injured. Does our solidarity with persecuted Christians last only a few weeks from the date of a tragedy?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, firstly, I should like to express my regret that this 300-page report tabled at the last minute exists in no other linguistic version than English. These are not good working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report is still a long list and was, without doubt, a compulsory exercise. There are some positive points; a number of improvements have been made, but there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For example, there are still many double standards in the examples provided, as well as some rather distorted perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why is there no mention of the human rights violations in all Latin American countries?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why are the murders of trade union representatives in Mexico and Colombia and the impunity granted to their killers not condemned?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why is the discrimination against Kurds in Turkey not condemned? Sakharov prize winner Leyla Zana was recently severely sentenced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why is the freedom not to believe not granted the same level of attention as the freedom to believe? Non-believers are, in many cases, the first victims of religious fundamentalism, yet this is not included in the statistics.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, there is the Arab Spring and the example of Tunisia. The EUR 150 million of extra aid is a derisory amount given the challenges being faced and when we know that Tunisia has a colossal debt of EUR 17 billion – a large part of which is odious debt – and that the country reimburses over EUR 300 million annually, a large part of which goes to the European Union. Millions of euros worth of Ben Ali’s assets remain frozen because they were paid for with public money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, just EUR 2 million of these funds were intended for local development, when this is, in fact, the crux of the problem. Local development is where Tunisian needs are the most colossal and was the main cause of the Tunisian revolution. Economic and social rights are just as important as civil and political rights.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, we are going to have a Special EU Representative for Human Rights, yet another new agency with its own staff, its own budget, etc. Yet another new figure who will be Europe’s spokesperson abroad. What the European Union needs is credibility, credibility that can only be achieved through consistency.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Because, how is it possible, for example, to negotiate about the accession of a country like Turkey, which is violating human rights on a large scale? How is it that a partnership and cooperation agreement has been reached with a country like Vietnam, a communist country where the human rights situation is precarious and where we cannot seriously even speak about human rights. The same applies to our relations with China. And what is the European Union doing for the Afrikaners in South Africa? I have the unfortunate impression that the European Union is blind in one eye.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will be brief, as I know we have many debates to complete this evening.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I first of all thank all honourable Members for their comments. All of them are important.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, can I say that I was clear, I thought, in my response that the European Union Special Representative (EU SR) will report to the institutions as defined in the Treaty. I made the point because – exactly as honourable Members are right to point out – it is important that we stick to the obligations that we have. In addition, I pointed out that the political accountability statements I have made also give the opportunity for Parliament to engage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Far from running away from it, I was making the point that we need to stick to the obligations that have been made, and I know that any Special Representative on human rights will wish to ensure that they have a strong relationship with the European Parliament, as indeed they will wish to have with the Council and, of course, the Commission and across the services. But I do draw honourable Members’ attention to Article 33 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, on the specific point on what is happening in regard to the ICC (International Criminal Court), you will not be surprised to know, Mr Howitt, that we are in touch with them on the ground through our delegation and, for the moment, we are working with them closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the representations that honourable Members have made about the issues and countries of greatest concern, I have taken note of all of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that we are consistent. It is important that we speak up seriously and properly on the issue of human rights. I have said many times that the only criteria for human rights to apply to any one of us is for us to be human and here. We have to make sure that that is the principle that we carry forward in all of the work that we do.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Annual Report on Human Rights is impressive. The European Union and the High Representative undertake very many initiatives in the area of protecting and promoting human rights. It cannot be denied, however, that there is still a gap between the recognition of human rights and their effective implementation of these rights. The rights of millions are breached as a result of poverty, wars, occupation and autocratic regimes. On many occasions, we have called for a more consistent, transparent and effective EU human rights policy. The appointment of a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights may breathe fresh life into these efforts. Whether or not this will be effective will depend, inter alia , on the mandate that the Special Representative is given, his/her experience, and whether or not EU institutions are willing to cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For the EU to speak with one voice on human rights issues, we need synergy between European Union institutions as regards the drafting of joint ideas and the undertaking of specific actions. We should also support international human rights institutions and mechanisms at national and regional levels. We must build global alliances in order to be effective in counteracting human rights violations. It is important for our reports to be verified and for conclusions to be drawn for successive years. Let us remember that throughout the world, it is women who are still the principal victims of discrimination, inequality, degradation and violence. For this reason, their rights should be treated as a priority.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today, the international trade in weapons is one of the least regulated sectors of international commerce. Armaments can be very easily diverted to the illegal market, can fuel conflicts and can be used in serious violation of human rights and international humanitarian law, and contribute to international crime and to terrorism. Weapons that fall into the wrong hands can have a devastating effect on regional and international peace and security. I would argue that international action is urgently needed to address this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the negotiations of a legally binding Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), we have the opportunity to set the highest possible standards to regulate international trade in arms. Such a treaty can make trade in arms more transparent, or accountable, and prevent the diversion of weapons.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has been at the forefront of this initiative from the beginning. We strongly believe that the Arms Trade Treaty has the potential to improve the lives and security conditions of hundreds of thousands of people around the world, by ensuring that weapons are traded in the most responsible way.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament has also played a major role in this campaign. The resolution of this House adopted in 2007, at the outset of the process, helped to gain political momentum in support of the ATT initiative. I welcome today the adoption of a new European Parliament resolution ahead of the UN conference in July, when the treaty will be negotiated.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a collective effort. EU Foreign Ministers will also agree in June on comprehensive Council conclusions on the ATT, setting the priorities for the negotiating conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">To have real impact on the way arms are traded at international level, we need to make sure that the treaty we negotiate in the United Nations will be as strong and robust as possible. The treaty should make sure that not only exports of weapons, but also transit, transhipment and brokering are controlled. There should be a shared responsibility by all players involved in the arms trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, we should make sure that all types of conventional weapons are controlled, and not only major military systems. Transfers of large quantities of small arms can have a much more destabilising effect than the transfer of a limited number of large military vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should make sure that the treaty contains clear and strong parameters, against which arms transfers can be assessed. This should ensure that arms are transferred and used in full respect of human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>
      <p sl="en">A treaty should also include a credible implementation mechanism, requiring State parties to put in place national control systems to control the transfer of weapons and to penalise transfers that have not been properly authorised. Finally, the treaty should contain a credible and clear transparency mechanism to increase accountability in the global arms trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The unity and coherence of the EU as a block will be put under pressure during the negotiations. But we must remain united. That is why my services are putting a huge amount of time and resources into coordinating our negotiating position, so that we are ready to defend them strongly at the negotiating table.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also proactively engaging with the major stakeholders in the remaining time. The treaty has been raised by the EU in all of our recent high-level meetings with third countries, including China, India, US, Russia, Pakistan and Mexico. On top of this, we have been conducting a major worldwide outreach campaign since 2009 involving ten regional seminars covering almost all of the countries in the framework of two Council decisions. Our work will not end with the negotiation of the treaty. In order to have real impact on international peace and security, the treaty must be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore stand ready to play our part, including through the provision of assistance to those countries that show willingness to establish effective arms transfer controls, but will need support to do so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I welcome the fact that the EU is taking on the important topic of the United Nations negotiations for a forthcoming Arms Trade Treaty. I also welcome the fact that, in the past, the EU has supported third countries in order to enable countries, via a subsidiary approach, to put in place more robust monitoring of the arms trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">I take the view that it is necessary not to lose sight of the following objective in the upcoming negotiations: we need a more comprehensive treaty that provides the scope for a monitoring regime that is realistic and capable of taking action. This treaty needs to be comprehensive with a view to the widest possible participation of all states and coverage of a broad spectrum of conventional weapons. A future treaty must thus prove itself to be capable of producing action, as it must succeed in actually curtailing uncontrolled and criminal trade in arms. Moreover, the treaty must be legally binding to a large extent so that international human rights provisions and international law are observed all around the world. You were right to highlight small arms, which are also easy to transport, as a particular problem in many areas, much more so than weapons of mass destruction sometimes. I am therefore pleased by the realism that you are displaying.</p>
      <p sl="de">Political realism is something that we also need in the evaluation of the demand from many sides for total transparency and accountability, including towards non-parliamentary bodies. I believe that each government must report to and provide disclosure to its national parliament, as the national parliament is the central site of political decision making and supervision. The vigilance and reporting of non-governmental and civil society organisations should be seen as an important, but supplementary function. I therefore hope that we succeed altogether – the EU and its Member States in the United Nations – in bringing about a control regime for the arms trade that really is realistic and capable of taking action.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow, the European Parliament stresses that ‘political accountability’ and ‘legally binding’ are key terms if the arms trade treaty is to protect humanity from a trade that feeds conflicts in the most vulnerable regions of the world. The European Union and its Member States should do more to support the UN action plan against the illegal trade in small and light arms, so it must strategically commit to a robust arms trade treaty that prevents the continued diversion of legally exported, imported or sold arms and military technologies into overthrowing democratic governments, exploiting peoples and fostering war. Transparency in the dissemination of all information on the export, import and transfer of arms and military technologies is crucial if governments are not to continue being accomplices of the dealers of death who traffic arms. An effective arms trade treaty must be binding on the State parties, using red lines and mechanisms for monitoring compliance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As Lady Ashton said, the European Union has to speak with one voice in next July’s negotiations, doing everything to ensure that the bar is not set lower than its own position on arms exports and that the treaty will be founded on international human rights law and international humanitarian law.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, at present, there are no rules on the arms trade that apply globally. Hopefully, there will be after the conference in New York in July. It is important to achieve a comprehensive treaty, to which not only the Member States of the European Union, but also China, India, the United States and Russia are party. The EU countries now have common rules for the trade in arms with third countries, but that is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I wish to raise a couple of key issues. Firstly, comprehensiveness is important, but alongside it I want to stress the importance of supervision. We need to have an effective, workable and binding system of supervision that also contains penalty clauses. Without transparency and effective supervision, the treaty threatens to be mere empty words. This has to be taken seriously – the idea that supervision should function successfully – and the United Nations is the best and most reliable body for that.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Secondly, I would like to mention the matter of respect for human rights and international law. This might seem odd, because, after all, war does not really concern itself with human rights, but I would nevertheless hope that the parties to this treaty will undertake to ensure that weapons are not supplied to countries and regions where there is a risk that they will be used for purposes of genocide or for some other truly appalling acts of a similar nature. War in itself is obviously appalling.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Baroness Ashton for her excellent levels of cooperation and for having taken this issue effectively forward, although it is of course now that the work is only just starting. I wish you every success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the ongoing crisis in Syria shows why we need a global arms trade treaty. China, and especially Russia, are exporting massive amounts of weapons to the Assad regime, thus contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children. A global arms trade treaty would put Russia, China and other arms-exporting countries in a much more difficult legal and moral position.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know that the EU is a proponent of a global ATT (Arms Trade Treaty). Now is the time for Member States and the EU delegation to push hard for this in New York. I consider the report we are going to vote on tomorrow helpful in reaching this goal. To make it even stronger, we have tabled several amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first calls for dual-use goods to be included in the Treaty. This is important as the distinction between military and civil items can no longer be made. They both use the same high-tech components. I know the Netherlands Government will take this up, and I welcome this very much.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, at committee level, colleagues in the EPP Group voted against my amendment which made reference to the need to have a strong anti-corruption mechanism in the ATT. This does not correspond to our common EU position, and I think this reference should be included. I hope that colleagues in the EPP Group will support this in the voting tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final aspect is the question of wider public access to, and information on, the arms trade. This also contradicts the existing practice in the EU, where NGOs and think tanks cooperate freely with EU working groups. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendments to keep the ATT implementation open to the wider public in the spirit of cooperation we enjoy at home.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I commend Ms Jäätteenmäki on this resolution which is, on the whole, a helpful and positive assessment of a very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the Arms Trade Treaty is just that: a trade treaty, and not a disarmament treaty. Over the years, I have been much involved in the campaign to ban anti-personnel landmines. That was different in that it was about eliminating a certain very specific weapon, often used indiscriminately and with terrible consequences, mainly by terrorist and insurgent groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were those that constantly sought to widen the scope of the resultant Ottawa Treaty into other fields, so it is important that we are clear about the limited purposes of this Arms Trade Treaty, which would not interfere in the right of a state to decide nationally on its arms export controls in compliance with internationally agreed criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK has a special interest in these matters. It is, of course, Europe’s leading arms exporter. It was also, by the way, one of the co-authors of the UN General Assembly resolution of 6 December 2006 that called for an internationally agreed arms trade treaty to be drawn up. I am pleased the resolution has not misunderstood or diminished the important role that defence industries play in terms of national security and in our economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, in discussing these matters, we are entering into important and sensitive areas of national sovereignty and it is unfortunate, therefore, that the resolution, perhaps inevitably, bows in the direction of what I would term ‘EU federalist competence creep’. For example, I do not understand why a coherent and consistent EU approach is crucial for this Treaty to be adopted and effectively implemented at a global level, or indeed why there is any point in the involvement of an EU delegation separate from Member States in negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is more important is that we put diplomatic effort into ensuring that countries such as China, Pakistan and Russia are signed up to the highest possible standards, rather than wasting valuable time harmonising European positions that are already very similar.</p>
      <p sl="en">Attention is focused on abuse too often, and I saw this over the Ottawa Treaty negotiations. We in a democracy indulge in debilitating self-flagellation, while the real abusers just carry on.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there has been significant opposition, especially in America and Canada, to the UN Arms Trade Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the control and regulation of international arms trading is necessary, there is a distinct lack of recourse to discrepancies in public opinion internationally with regard to this particular debate. Many households in America have handguns and a great number of families in Canada use guns for hobby and hunting purposes. However, in the UK, few people have access to small firearms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those who use guns for illicit purposes are unlikely to be swayed from criminal behaviour by the introduction of new legislation, although pan-national cooperation to restrict the availability of arms on the black market is something I vehemently support.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU may have broad-reaching control of trade in Europe, but designating a single European stance in this area represents a sizeable foray into the realm of foreign affairs and thus encroaches upon the prerogatives of both NATO and national governments. By doing so, the EU is effectively mounting a subversive campaign against public opinion across the Atlantic.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, over recent years, the international arms trade has grown further, and the countries of the European Union can once again claim a dubious success: at 34%, they have the leading share of the trade. Many of these exports go to countries with – and I word this carefully – a dubious human rights record, and into conflict areas. That is why there needs to be a complete ban on arms trading, especially in relation to conflict regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current negotiations at UN level on an Arms Trade Treaty represent a step in the right direction. We continue to hope that the treaty will not later turn out to be a paper tiger as toothless as previous agreements. For that reason, following a successful conclusion of the treaty, implementation needs to remain on the political agenda consistently. The constructive, cross-group cooperation on the current resolution is a good sign, and one that I am pleased about.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore all the more disappointing that we were unable to avoid the positive reference to the arms industry in paragraph 2 of the resolution. Aside from the moral aspects, I would like to point out that studies have concluded beyond doubt that the influence of military expenditure on jobs is very low in comparison with other public spending. Rather than jobs, it is mostly about ensuring the profits of this branch of industry, the more so given that disarmament and conversion could promote sustainable development, growth and jobs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to start by saying thank you for the presence of the High Representative as well as the many people in the audience. I know that it is not easy to focus on a treaty on the arms trade when the eyes of the whole world are focused on football pitches.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to say how glad I am that, as the High Representative has just said, the European Union has played a particularly active role in these bilateral talks. The arms trade is something that we do, of course, have to deal with in the European Union, but we will not be successful if we do not work with other countries such as the United States, China and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are, of course, aware that trading in arms has been, and continues to be, a controversial issue. The European Union is an arms producer and exporter. There are several hundred thousand people working in arms manufacturing in the European Union. There are cuts in defence budgets. It is, of course, natural that companies involved in the arms trade should try to find external markets and export weapons. However, as has been noted by several speakers, this must be within the law. As Ms Lösing said just a moment ago, we must avoid selling arms to conflict areas and we must ensure that these weapons are not used against civilians or in a way that breaches human rights.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the legal vacuum and anarchy prevailing due to the absence of an arms trade treaty are having tragic consequences, causing human misery and undermining the European Union’s promises to promote the rule of law, human rights and peace in the world. We therefore strongly advocate the need for an integrated, legally binding and strong treaty covering all aspects of the conventional arms trade, including, small hunting firearms and ammunition.</p>
      <p sl="el">One important point that needs to be covered by the treaty is the transparency of the entire process. Without transparency, it will be impossible to guarantee the application of the treaty in practice or progress in stamping out corruption, which often goes hand in glove with the arms trade. The initial text of the resolution that we are debating today contained proper reference to this; however, it has been eliminated in amendments by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We trust that plenary of the European Parliament will review that position and send out a strong message of support for a binding arms trade treaty; a message of critical importance in light of the crucial UN conference next month. Although the signs are not there, that conference can and must be crowned with success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have two questions to ask Baroness Ashton as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I do not understand what the EU role is in this United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Here is a very welcome agreement concluded by the intra-governmental United Nations with 193 nation states involved – only Zimbabwe voted against it – so nation states and the UN are at one. Why, then, do we need a supranational trespasser, in the form of the EU, to muscle in on the action?</p>
      <p sl="en">A second related question is what role does the European Defence Agency (EDA) have, given its arms export control policy? At least EDA, again, is international, not supranational. But why did it allegedly take you from 1 December 2009, when you were appointed as Head of the EDA, to January 2012 – two years – to actually visit its premises? It is only 15 minutes from your Brussels office. Is it actually so low priority?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to commend our colleague on preparing an excellent report. I can only agree with the High Representative that it is the least regulated sector of economic activities that we have to deal with. It is an irony that global arms exports have been spared the economic crisis. Instead, they have flourished.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU Member States are responsible for about one third of all arms exports; of the ten leading exporters of arms, six are EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Uncontrolled trading in arms continues to be a constant challenge, not only to international peace but also to democracy. Therefore, our ideal should be a legally binding and comprehensive Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has a special responsibility for the overall improvement of the situation because if we cannot take the lead in showing determination and coordination, then what can we expect from others? Therefore, we call on the Member States to provide their full support to the EU delegation taking part in future negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Job creation is a reality that cannot simply be set aside, but it should not become an excuse for evading a clear commitment to UN standards, transparency and a united European approach. The justification given for selling Mistrals to Russia was the preservation of jobs in the French shipbuilding industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clear provisions for regular reporting by all future parties to the treaty on all arms transfer decisions, including the disclosure of recipients of military equipment, will be of key importance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is my last speech of the afternoon. With apologies to the High Representative, since the detail of this debate is important, I just want to say in one minute that we are on the verge of an historic achievement. We have had the EU Code of Conduct on arms exports stopping irresponsible transfers of arms to those who would use them for oppression or human rights abuse. We now have the chance to enshrine this in a global convention and prevent what are estimated to be half a million deaths each year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we must be self-critical about bad decisions in the past, including the supply of arms from the European Union that were subsequently used against unarmed protestors, for example, in Libya, Bahrain and Yemen. But we should also celebrate the leadership given from Europe for this treaty: the European Parliament’s own leading role in consistently calling for a legally binding treaty; that EU countries have been unanimous in their agreement of Amnesty International’s rigorous golden rule within the treaty text; and I hope you do not mind if I also draw attention to the former British Labour foreign secretaries, the late Robin Cook and subsequently David Miliband, for their personal contribution to what I end by repeating will be an historic achievement.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, arms play an important role in safeguarding security and in the defence sector but, at the same time, they can fuel conflicts, violence and instability. This is why I maintain that clear regulations are needed on the arms trade at a global level. I also tabled an amendment in which I emphasised the benefit of having specific provisions on marking arms. I also highlighted the need for additional measures to ensure traceability from the manufacturer to the end user. This features in paragraph 9 of the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Adopting a multilateral legal instrument will allow higher standards to be applied and ensure greater transparency in this area. However, to ensure that the new treaty achieves its objectives, it must include specific provisions on the accountability mechanisms. I should point out, in this context, the need to focus greater attention on preventing and combating illegal arms trafficking. In 2001, EUR 1 398 billion was spent globally on arms, according to SIPRI, which is equivalent to 2.5% of global GDP. Indeed, a recent report from Oxfam indicates that countries subject to embargoes have managed to procure weapons to the value of USD 2.2 billion in the last 12 years.</p>

I simply wish to express my satisfaction with the support for a United Nations treaty that is seeking to bring order to a trade system that is out of control.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to increase control, regulation and transparency in the manufacturing of, and trade in, arms. This does not mean being against the manufacturing of arms for a specific country. My country has a significant arms industry, but we nevertheless have other contradictions: for example, a minister who has been a top executive in the production of arms, missiles and anti-personnel mines now being in charge of the department. This contradiction is a reason why we need the greater transparency that we are going to have in the international community and in the European Union, speaking with one voice rather than each country speaking alone.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the international community devotes a great amount of time and resources to the issue of weapons of mass destruction that have a very small chance of being used. Countries are invaded and wars are fought for a threat that is largely improbable. At the same time, conventional weapons and small arms kill tens of thousands of people every year and this issue is almost unnoticed.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this Arms Trade Treaty is welcome. The Socialists and Democrats regret that the EU Member States continue to sell large amounts of weapons to dictatorships, authoritarian regimes and countries whose leaders use weapons to suppress dissent. The same Member States, on the other hand, declare their support for democracy and human rights every day. But the conventional weapons and small arms often sold by them are the material instrument of the most blatant crimes. These small arms and weapons have been extensively used in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya against peaceful demonstrators. So, any instrument like this treaty that goes in the direction of resolving these unacceptable paradoxes and contradictions is welcomed by us.</p>

I am very pleased to hear that the European Union is actively involved in the preparation of a UN treaty on the arms trade. What is needed is a global treaty in this difficult area. I would, however, also like to point out that we must think very carefully about the nature of this treaty. The arms trade does not just mean the import and export of weapons. In my opinion, our future efforts should be more focused on the re-export of arms and on technical assistance in modernising old weapons. These instruments are frequently used to get round the law and result in the wrong people obtaining weapons. I would therefore argue for more attention to be given to the re-export of arms and to the technical modernisation of old weaponry.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, whilst I appreciate the efforts of the European Union to regulate the arms trade and seek more effective control mechanisms for the transit and sale of arms, it seems to me that we could maybe try to establish a more sophisticated mechanism for the distribution of new weapons and weapons systems which would exclude the institution of sale, whereby, following a transaction, the manufacturer and supplier would lose their grip on the future use of such goods. Perhaps we could create a more effective system for controlling the use of weapons and weapons systems if, under the auspices of the United Nations, we were able to adopt a philosophy whereby a manufacturer and distributor would have purview over the use of heavy weapons in particular and weapons systems throughout their lifespans by means of exclusive servicing and supply of consumables; the weapons and weapons systems would not then become the property of the end user, but would only be owned on a leasehold basis. In such a case, the owner and weapons manufacturer would still retain control over how the weapons and weapons systems would be used in the future, and this would then allow us to have an input as to their use.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the recent commotion about the supply of German submarines to Israel is, to some extent, whimsical, it seems to me, as Berlin has long been a world leader in global arms exports. Moreover, we should be clearly aware that a country like Israel will not be dictated to in respect of whether and how it fits and refits weaponry supplied to it. Of course, voices will be raised once again in this regard, calling for total bans on arms exports. Demands of that kind are not efficacious, however, if you think that there is a gigantic black market for the arms trade in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">The forthcoming United Nations conference about an international arms trade control treaty may also be useful for the construction of a system that improves compliance with weapons embargoes. However, it will not really be able to put a stop to the illegal arms trade, and I believe it is against that trade that we need to take stronger action, instead of bullying arms manufacturers and dealers and millions of sport shooters and hunters in EU Member States with new regulations, especially with regulations that do not actually provide any safety benefit.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I believe that on this day, when we are negotiating the UN arms trade treaty, we should also take a serious look at ourselves. We make a pretence of being world champions in the protection of human rights and the protection of lawfulness; meanwhile, European firms, manufacturers and particularly retailers also give their systems to third countries, and even to those countries where they should not be going at all. This sorrows me greatly, and I am appalled by the fact that another major player on the world stage, Russia, continues to supply Syria with weapons systems which it uses for the destruction of the natural democratisation in its country. The transit and sales of arms cannot be so difficult to control, and I believe that this is a wonderful example of how toothless we are in the absence of a system of sanctions against those who violate this treaty.</p>

I wish to thank all these and the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their excellent and fruitful cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, given the situation in the region, let me begin with the crisis that is unfolding in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not have to say how appalled all Members of this House and all of us are by the sickening violence that we continue to witness in Syria. Security forces and militias have bombarded cities with no regard for citizens. There have been massacres and point-blank killings. We have seen this last week in a village near Hama, and the week before in Houla, where security forces and militias killed men, women and children. Those responsible for these crimes must ultimately be held to account and we must focus on doing everything we can to stop this bloodshed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are at a critical moment. The situation is deteriorating day by day as the regime’s behaviour reinforces the most radical elements on all sides. And yet most ordinary Syrians long for the transition that would avoid bloodshed, keep the country together and respect minorities. If the descent into further militarisation continues, it will spell terrible disaster not only for the people of Syria, but also for the broader region – I am thinking especially of Lebanon – where developments are extremely worrying.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have discussed with Kofi Annan – over recent weeks and most lately on Friday – we must spare no effort to avoid a catastrophe. Assad has no place in the future of Syria. His regime fails to comply with its own commitments and every day underlines its lack of legitimacy. The implementation of Kofi Annan’s plan is certainly not easy and its viability has been questioned. But despite all the challenges, it remains today the best way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to act decisively to prevent further bloodshed, while avoiding fuelling the flames of sectarian violence. The only way forward is first of all to reinforce Kofi Annan’s leverage with the Syrian regime and to try to make the mission more effective. No other option has been able to gather together any kind of international support. I do pay tribute to Kofi Annan for his extraordinary efforts in exceedingly difficult conditions. He has the support and legitimacy of the international community through the United Nations and, of course, through the Arab League. Secretary-General Ban-Ki moon told the General Assembly on Thursday that this plan must remain the centrepiece of our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">But that alone is not enough. We need to do much more to further isolate the regime, build real and operational international consensus, strengthen international sanctions and press the government towards compliance and transition. As Kofi Annan himself has made very clear, all concerned – and, in particular, the Members of the UN Security Council and those who have influence on the regime and on Russia and China in particular – must unite and apply more effective pressure to move forward to a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we need to agree on a road map that reinforces Kofi Annan and the plan and that involves, I would argue, three key priorities: firstly, a more effective contact group that includes Russia and China, to coordinate support for Kofi Annan and exert influence on the regime. I therefore welcome the idea of a contact group of key actors on the Syrian crisis announced by Kofi Annan last Thursday in the UN Security Council. The international community has to show unity in this critical moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, united action by the UN Security Council to add more robust and effective pressure, including the reinforcement of sanctions under Chapter VII and, thirdly, international consensus around a political process and transition.</p>
      <p sl="en">With those three priorities in mind, I have engaged with Kofi Annan and other leaders to try to seek a new consensus, including meeting last week in Istanbul, where I attended a special meeting on Syria, and at the EU-Russia Summit the weekend before.</p>
      <p sl="en">Work on the political process cannot wait. It is crucial for the credibility of the international efforts and to show the people of Syria that there is a path leading to a better, rather than a more fragmented, Syria. But for this to happen, the opposition must finally come together and put its differences aside. Frankly, new leadership is not enough. A stronger and more united opposition that represents a credible alternative for all Syrians is essential.</p>
      <p sl="en">We discussed ongoing efforts with Turkey and we are coordinating closely with the Arab League. We continue to meet the different factions and groups in the opposition. Now we are working on two seminars that will feed into the Arab League plans to organise a larger meeting with them.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to our sanctions, diplomatic efforts and support to the UN Mission, which are appreciated by the UN, humanitarian assistance remains a top priority for the EU. Innocent civilians and children are paying the price of this crisis. I am working closely with Commissioner Georgieva to use all the tools we have at our disposal to deliver our assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already allocated over EUR 28 million to address the humanitarian needs inside Syria and its neighbouring countries. We need the Syrian Government to implement the agreed comprehensive humanitarian response plan without any more excuses or delays.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, the Commission approved EUR 23 million in special measures – I had previously announced that in this plenary and it has now been approved – to support civil society within Syria and neighbouring countries who are supporting Syrian refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I was in Istanbul last week, our Crisis Coordinator engaged with the Turkish authorities and visited the camps on Turkey’s borders. We offered further help to Turkey, as needed. I believe that Turkey is doing a great job in dealing with the refugees, and they can count on our support as they continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will continue to call for accountability and support UN efforts in this regard. This is something that we owe to the victims. The UN is investigating the latest massacres and the Human Rights Council – with our full support – is setting up a Committee of Investigation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some Member States have decided to withdraw and expel Ambassadors. Our Delegation in Damascus will remain open for as long as possible. This has been the request of many honourable Members and, more importantly, of the Syrians themselves. They are our ears, eyes and hands to help on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I might, I will now turn to the Middle East peace process where our objective remains the same. I have been very clear from the beginning of what we call the Arab Spring or Arab Awakening that developments in the region make the peace process and a negotiated solution even more urgent and important, not less. While we have to pay – and should pay – great attention to events in Syria, Egypt and elsewhere, ending the conflict remains a key priority and a fundamental European Union interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and the Quartet continue efforts to facilitate contacts between the parties, to resume direct and substantive talks, in line with the statements the Quartet has made, both in September last year and April of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have already mentioned in this House the work of Jordan and, in particular, I thank His Majesty King Abdullah II and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Judeh for their good offices in fostering the conditions to try to see the resumption of these negotiations. We are working closely with them to do everything we can to facilitate the process and I hope the 14 May Foreign Affairs Council conclusions demonstrated to all the strong and principled position of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have welcomed the recent exchange of letters between the parties and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s statement that the new Israeli Government will try to advance ‘a responsible peace process’. We want the parties to build on positive exchanges and resume direct talks.</p>
      <p sl="en">We remain unequivocally committed to the security of Israel, including with regard to vital threats in the region. We have condemned all forms of violence against civilians, including the rocket attacks from Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the truth is that while the Middle East peace process is not making the progress we all want, the prospects for a two-state solution are being undermined by developments on the ground. Proposals for new settlements around East Jerusalem, the lack of Palestinian involvement in Area C, the growth of settlements in the West Bank, settler violence and the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority all threaten the viability of a two-state solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU Foreign Ministers at the last Foreign Affairs Council expressed a clear and strong consensual position in our conclusions, forging a common EU approach to developments on the ground. This was an important step forward. Insisting on the need to respect international and humanitarian law is absolutely consistent with our friendship with Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">Settlements remain the key and most serious concern. Only last week, I deplored the Israeli Government’s plans to build over 800 additional settlement housing units. Settlement expansion has to be condemned because these are illegal under international law and put current peace efforts at risk. I want to reiterate my call on the Israeli Government to exercise the highest sense of responsibility by reversing these decisions, in full respect of international law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, unless they are agreed by both parties. Plans for major settlement expansion around the city’s southern flank risk cementing this, and the prospect of Jerusalem as the future capital for both states is being further undermined.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards settlement products, EU Foreign Ministers underlined the need to work with the Commission to ensure EU legislation is implemented effectively and with as much transparency as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will follow up on the Council conclusions, also seeking progress with regard to Area C for the benefit of the Palestinian population – a pressing issue that was the focus of our discussions at the last Ad Hoc Liaison Committee I hosted in Brussels. I believe development of Area C is critical to the viability of a future Palestinian state. Israel needs to help and facilitate this with concrete and pragmatic steps. We are also really concerned by recent and increasing incidents of settler violence, which we all condemn.</p>
      <p sl="en">The precarious state of the Palestinian Authority’s finances is an issue. I have been engaged with them from the beginning of my mandate, working closely with Foreign Minister Støre of Norway. I want to thank Parliament again for its principled and constructive position with regard to the EU budget as I continue to urge countries in the region, and others, to share the burden and increase their support.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the humanitarian front, of course, the most pressing situation is in Gaza. I have visited three times since taking office, so my message and our support are clear. We need to open the crossings in Gaza as the best way of improving the well-being of the people and to see goods and people move freely. On the political front, I recognise the concrete progress on the reconciliation which President Abbas has engaged in.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I want to stress again that the EU’s involvement in the region is also defined by its commitment to human rights, which must be respected by both parties. We will continue to address these issues in the context of our bilateral relations at all levels. I have been really concerned at reports of Palestinian Authority restrictions on freedom of speech and have urged both sides to deal effectively with acts of incitement. The extensive use of administrative detention is a key concern we raise at every opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish by reiterating our stated policy, which is a negotiated two-state solution. A one-state outcome cannot be the solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated last week his support for a two-state solution, and I hope we will see those strong words of his supported by action from both sides to move forward to a negotiated settlement for the people of Israel and the people of Palestine.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus on the case of Syria. We have run out of adjectives to describe the deterioration of the situation there and the growing number of victims, including executed women and children. The words that best describe the way the international community feels are indignation and, of course, a feeling of frustration and powerlessness.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that Kofi Annan’s plan has failed spectacularly and that we will need to think about other options. Keeping a minute’s silence – as occurred recently at the United Nations – and applying economic sanctions are hardly ways to overcome this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Secretary General of the United Nations has said quite clearly that the President of Syria has entirely lost his legitimacy and that we cannot become accustomed to massacres being a daily occurrence. This situation and this conflict are dragging on too long, in my view, with the complicity, in particular, of a permanent member of the Security Council and of the Iranian regime.</p>
      <p sl="es">Baroness Ashton, a moment ago in this House, we had an extensive debate on the European Union’s role in defending rights and fundamental freedoms in the EU. Above and beyond our presence in the various contact groups, which is entirely justified, the EU has an obligation to put forward initiatives to bring an end to this situation and prevent the President of Syria from continuing to buy more time and massacring the opposition.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also clear that the Syrian National Council must cooperate, and we hope that its new president, elected in Istanbul the other day, can unite the internal and external opposition. However, given the failure of diplomatic measures, there are not many options left open: humanitarian intervention, which is currently not possible due to the vetoes by Russia and China in the Security Council; political agreements with President al-Assad, which are continuing to result in him buying more time and cruelly repressing the opposition; or other mechanisms that would ultimately result in a civil war being sparked, which is already practically the case.</p>
      <p sl="es">Experience in neighbouring countries has shown us that, in order to try to bring an end to this situation in the short term, we need to seek political solutions to transfer power in the medium term. In this context, this solution is very difficult without a military presence and international troops.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are my questions, Baroness Ashton: do you ultimately think it will be possible to provide a military presence in order to try to respond and stop the dreadful conflict currently taking place in Syria? Who would be responsible for supplying those troops?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to join my fellow Member, Mr Salafranca, and Baroness Ashton in expressing how powerless and horrified we feel by the images coming to us from Syria. Nevertheless, I do not completely agree with Mr Salafranca’s idea today of military presence, or at least, we would need to agree upon what we call military presence in the sense that there are currently observers in place whose mandate could possibly be extended.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I think that the temptation of military intervention in this part of the world is so great – given that on one side of Syria you have Lebanon, half of which is in support of Bashar al-Assad, that you have Iran close by, with Iraq next door, and given the destabilisation and terrorism which will undoubtedly occur in the region – that we are truly faced with a dilemma. For the time being, aside from the extremely strong political pressure and aside from the humanitarian pressure with regard to which some progress has been made today, I believe that the impact of military intervention would be much more disastrous.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, Baroness Ashton, I should like to ask you some questions. Part of the solution, or part of the problem rather, lies with Russia. An EU-Russia Summit was held: what was Russia’s response? They proposed that an international conference be held on Syria and that Iran be included: what is your reaction to that? What was said in relation to arms and Russia? That, after all, is one of our main areas of concern with regard to Syria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the moment, aside from the Annan plan which has been strengthened with deadlines and the handing over of power, even by leaving Bashar al-Assad in the shadows, I personally fear a proxy war, as we would say, that is to say, foreign forces battling in a religious war. Moreover, I would add, unfortunately, that while Bashar al-Assad is illegitimate in our eyes because of the crimes he has committed and for which he will be held responsible, he is still not perceived as illegitimate by at least 50% of the population, if not more. We must today be wary of the support for Bashar al-Assad, whether this be down to conviction or down to the fear of chaos and a religious war.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards Israel and Palestine – and I see that I have gone over my time – we must address the issue at another time, during which we will discuss the colonies again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we completely share the High Representative’s indignation and horror at what is ongoing in Syria, and all the frustrations at the difficulties we encounter. The sensitivities, or rather the temperaments, of some of my colleagues in my group might be different, some more inclined to intervene more quickly, others more aware of – well everybody is aware of – all the complexities of the situation, but according to our temperaments, some might or might not demand quicker interventions.</p>
      <p sl="de">My personal hopes are, High Representative, that the course you have chosen brings improvements and contributes to halting the horrors which are ongoing and that we finally see the departure of a leader who certainly, morally, has become completely illegitimate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say a few things now about the Arab Spring, or what we call the Arab Spring. Of course, no two situations are alike and the situation in each of those countries is different. Myself, being a special friend of, or having a special tender feeling for Morocco, I am sometimes a little bit concerned that it might be overlooked because everything is going too smoothly, so to say, and that would be a pity. But that is not the most important thing right now.</p>
      <p sl="de">Right now, what I would like to warn against is excessive pessimism. The elections might not have given all the results we would have hoped for, but at least in most of the countries where they took place, they have taken place in rather satisfactory circumstances, although there are question marks about the way things have gone in Algeria. I believe that the people in those countries deserve our continuing support, and one of the worst things we could do is turn our backs on them because they have not one hundred percent voted the way we would have ideally liked them to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, on the Middle East, there are two short things I would like to say: first of all, it should be clear to everybody that my entire political group is excessively committed to the possibility for Israel to develop in a secure way. At the same time, we are just as committed to seeing a two-state solution and very worried at seeing how this is becoming, on the ground, more and more difficult.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to welcome the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The picture we get from Syria every day is more and more desperate. Let me reiterate that any leader who treats his people in this way – no matter how big his support might be, and I even doubt the 50% – can have any legitimacy in our view.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three issues we would like you to tackle.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, strengthen the local and internal opposition to pave the way for political transition. As you have mentioned to some extent, we need to support the internal opposition, the local committees – many of whom are working towards and form the diversity of the opposition movement – to help them build stronger links and, if necessary, to arrange meetings outside Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, of course, we need a political solution based on such an increase in internal coherence. I think you were right to mention the contact group; you mentioned Russia and China. Can I also ask for Iran to be included? I know there are some opposing voices inside the UN and US, but I think we need them to be a part of this if we want to have a solution, because they are part of the problem right now. We need to rethink our position there.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you find such a contact group and possibly a solution, I think we need to back that up much more strongly than with the current UN mission. We need not hundreds, we need thousands; we need a full UN peacekeeping mission and I think it would be high time to prepare for it now. We know how long it takes for it to be effectively deployed on the ground. Ms Ashton, I call on you to prepare this now; to get it ready, so that in time of need, we can deploy it rapidly and have a full-on mission on the ground, and not just a few hundred.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear, I am not calling for a UN mandate for international intervention as is the case in Libya, but for a peacekeeping mission inside Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">One final point. You were talking about Russia. Are we ready to put all the incentives and sanctions on the table that are needed to convince the Russians to allow for the downfall of Assad? What is it that we are really putting on a table? What price are we willing to pay to get Russia on board?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group utterly condemns the barbaric atrocities perpetrated against innocent civilians, including women and children, by the al-Assad Ba’athist regime in Syria. Damascus has turned its paramilitary thugs against its own citizens. The so-called ‘shabiha’ are beyond control and are increasingly acting with total impunity. Their atrocities have actually shocked the international community and are reminiscent in my view of the unspeakable atrocities of the Balkans 20 years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Considering the rapidly deteriorating situation, it is clear now that the Annan Plan has sadly failed, so Russia must now step up and use its unique leverage on Damascus to effect change and reverse its Security Council veto, thus unblocking the path for robust international action on Syria to prevent further bloodshed and pave the way, hopefully, for a democratic regime change with al-Assad well gone.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia must be aware that its credibility now is seriously at stake in the Arab world. China will surely follow the Russian lead. Clearly, the international community must now look to the Arab League for guidance, but I am not sure about Saudi Arabia and Qatar alone, because they are not entirely credible in my view as they are not true democracies and they are far too close politically speaking, and even arming the salafists. The Syrian National Council must now be more united. We must work on that, so all options are open to the West, including now an arms embargo and even limited military intervention to protect further civilian atrocities. All this must remain on the table to avert further descent into an all-out sectarian civil war, or even Rwanda or Srebrenica-style genocide.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also consider proposing a fresh resolution in the Security Council to indict al-Assad and his henchmen before the ICC. Turkey, of course, is a key player and, ultimately, is a democracy with the military might to intervene, if it so wishes, at its borders, to impose a humanitarian safe corridor if necessary. Iran, which is dragging its feet, as you well know High Representative, with the EU and the IAEA over nuclear negotiations, will do everything it can to support its Damascus ally and its proxy Hezbollah, but the EU has no interest whatsoever, Ms Brantner, in supporting either of these two brutal regimes. Iran does not belong in the contact group, I am sorry.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, more Christians have been murdered in Syria this year than in neighbouring Iraq between 2003 and 2011. I was told this shocking fact earlier this week by a good friend, a knowledgeable Arabist, who is stationed in Damascus. Meanwhile, the Alawite minority in Syria, approximately 3 million people, fear outright genocide if the current Assad regime is overthrown. This is not a figment of my imagination, because hate preachers, such as Adnan al-Arour, have openly been calling for this from Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Baroness Ashton, how does the European Union assess this Syrian nightmare? At the same time, I would ask you, if you have not done so already, to challenge Saudi Arabia about the spreading of inflammatory language through satellites from Saudi territory. I was told yesterday by reliable Syrian sources that Salafist rebels are now so heavily armed that they control whole neighbourhoods and even entire towns.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This has been conclusively documented for the Christian neighbourhoods in Homs and the towns of Rastan and Qusair. Following Homs, some 10 000 Christian citizens from Qusair, having had to abandon all their possessions, were last week expelled by armed rebels. Are you equally familiar with this piece of information and, if so, has this sad expulsion led to any action or response on the part of the EU?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, as regards the situation in Syria, we condemn the violence and crimes directed mainly against the civilian population. All sides need to apply the Annan peace plan and allow room for a political solution that provides a peaceful exit from that situation, which is threatening the country with civil war and fragmentation. At the same time, we are against any military intervention. The situation is putting the entire region at risk of catastrophic repercussions, as we are already seeing from events in Lebanon and, together with the Israeli Government’s plans to strike Iran, is taking on nightmare proportions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Israel is still destroying on the ground in Palestine any chance of the two-state solution to which the international community is committed. The recent decision to erect 800 new units for settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories is the last in a series of such acts. We condemn the persecution of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, which is designed to change the demographic make-up of that town. We condemn the demolition of houses, the continuing long-term imprisonment of Palestinians and the continual human rights violations. We call on the European Union to recognise an independent Palestinian state that will secure a peaceful future for Palestinians and Israelis and contribute to the stability of the entire region.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Syria is clearly becoming more and more of a witches’ brew of conflicts. Alongside those opposition activists who are demanding reforms, there are others who will clearly only be satisfied with the fall or removal of President Assad. In addition, ultra-religious factions are increasingly getting involved, and they now sense an opportunity to found an Islamist state. The fact that Syria plays an important strategic role in the region makes things more complicated still. The multi-religious tensions are being intensified by ethnic conflicts. These are carried over into already unstable neighbouring countries by refugees, and the result could be the development of something like a conflagration.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a failure of the peace plan is, I would argue, conceivable, it is important, at any event, to keep turning up the pressure on Syria. A military intervention, however, could cause more harm than good, in my view. This is because, unlike in Libya, there is no clear front between the regime and the rebels that could be defended. Rather, the whole thing is slowly sliding into a mass slaughter in individual city districts.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that there is no unified political opposition is a further cause of confusion. The example of Libya has shown us that a fall of the regime would not necessarily lead to an improvement in the human rights situation. If radical Islamists get into power after the fall of the regime, there could be a real threat of bloodbaths, given the prevailing ethnic tensions, and that is something that, from the European Union’s side, we should definitely prevent.</p>

Lady Ashton, I must say I was very pleased with the Council’s conclusions of 14 May, because the parties involved are saying that they should refrain from actions that undermine the credibility of the peace process and they are also voicing their concerns regarding the developments on the ground that are making the two-state solution impossible, such as the Israeli settlement policy, which is in violation of international law. They are also really making themselves heard on the subject of the poor living conditions of the Palestinians in Area C.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is also something that I am missing in the Council conclusions because, if the two-state solution is not achieved, what will happen next? What lever will we have if these diplomatic and practical initiatives do not lead to an effective peace process? What are we going to do as the European Union? How can we enforce a solution? How long will the commitment of a credible mediator still be credible if the parties do not comply with the agreements made?</p>
      <p sl="nl">We and, in particular, the European Union, must do everything to bring political pressure to bear on the parties. We are Israel’s most important trading partner, but we are also the largest sender of aid to the Palestinian Authority. I believe that it is definitely time that we started using the levers because a community of values like the European Union can no longer afford to rely on a hands-off approach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning briefly to Syria. What are we doing and what will the European Union do to persuade Russia, and China, too, to a lesser extent, to collaborate with the embargo? It seems to me to be the only way to ensure that we can prevent the civil war that all of us can see coming.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the images we get daily of men, women and children savagely massacred in Syria leave us short of words to express our horror and our solidarity with the Syrian people. Bashar al-Assad and his henchmen and women, if they survive, will have to face international justice for crimes against humanity and war crimes against their people, but ominous responsibility also lies with their backers, Russia and China in particular, who continue to sell weapons to the regime and block action in the UN Security Council to stop the bloodshed, thus boycotting, in practice, the Annan Plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The incapacity of the UN Security Council to call for the international community to exercise their responsibility to protect the Syrian people is making the bloody conflict become a civil war, dramatically impacting a region already plagued by conflict. Lady Ashton, I fully second your words urging the Israeli authorities to stop the illegal settlement activity and move towards genuine peace with Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iran, Saudi Arabia and Qatar should also be warned by the UN Security Council, and certainly by the European Union, about their interference in instigating the sectarian bloodshed by conducting their own proxy war in Syria at the expense of the Syrian people.</p>
      <p sl="en">To the brave Syrians resisting at home and abroad, I can only, in all honesty, say that they must not wait for international action, should guard themselves from being used by extremists and terrorists and must lose no time in getting united under a platform for national salvation to overthrow the tyrant regime and move towards a new era of democratic conviviality among all ethnic and religious segments of the Syrian people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is a popular saying which says that all that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing. I am not suggesting that the EU has responded inadequately to the Syrian crisis, but rather that in the light of recent events, we simply have to do more.</p>
      <p sl="en">The crisis that has lasted for the past 15 months has turned Syria into a genuine battlefield, where thousands of innocent people have been killed. The reluctance to initiate a ceasefire or, more specifically, meet the conditions of the Annan Plan, show there to be no indications of these killings stopping.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the international community has the obligation to step up and consider all possible measures that can put an end to this horrific power struggle. The targeted sanctions, including travel bans and financial penalties against the regime, must be further implemented. More importantly, the EU should urge all countries to adopt an embargo on the supply of arms to the Syrian regime, starting with Russia.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, many members have already focused on Syria, and rightly so. I fully support that focus, but I want to say something in addition about the Middle East. The European Union has, indeed, been the biggest sender of aid to the Palestinians for some years but, time and again, we have seen our efforts cancelled out by actions from the Israeli side.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Like Ms Oomen-Ruijten, I, too, am pleased with the latest decisions from the Foreign Affairs Council on the Middle East. They have really touched on the heart of the matter given Israel’s subsequent prickly reaction which means that we definitely hit the right spot. Obviously, these words look great on paper, but I keep asking myself the following question: what should the EU do to really contribute to the peace process?</p>
      <p sl="nl">On this subject, I have a very specific question about the Quartet: what do you think about the proposal put forward by the Arab League to include them in the Quartet and make it into a Quintet? I know that the United States are blocking that move but what does the EU think? Perhaps this could provide new momentum! And, better still, perhaps the UN Security Council should again be directly charged with managing the peace process given that we did not get anywhere with Mr Blair’s mediation mission.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the behaviour of President Assad should come as no surprise to anyone. He is a dictator and he is behaving in exactly the same way as any dictator would to maintain his power and keep his money, irrespective of the ideology – be it right-wing, left-wing, nationalist or religious – that is used for this purpose. History has shown that any dictator of this kind will do everything he can to stay in power. President Assad is going further than some of the bloodiest dictators. To stay in power, he is murdering innocent children and civilians. I believe that the right place for President Assad is in front of the International Criminal Court, as it must now be said loudly and clearly that President Assad is a criminal who has committed crimes against his own nation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, the issue that we should find the most worrying is that a country that is an important partner for the European Union and is our neighbour, namely Russia, is supporting the Assad regime for entirely cynical reasons. Let us ask ourselves the question: what are the values that guide the Putin regime, if they are not shaken by the sight of murdered children?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank Baroness Ashton for the information she has given us. Indeed, the terrible crimes against the civilian population attributed to both the Syrian Government and the opposition, need to be rigorously and impartially investigated in order to convict those responsible. Those crimes should not, however, give rise to military intervention such as in Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya. Those three military interventions made the world much less safe: the proof of the pudding is in the eating. An example of this is Afghanistan, which we do not know how to get out of, and where the Taliban have no less control than they did before the intervention.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is not, therefore, the time to wage war. It is a time to promote the use of diplomatic channels. I welcome the conclusions of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, in which its Member States, including China and Russia, are calling for the use of diplomatic channels to be encouraged, and for an international summit – as suggested by Russia – on Syria and, therefore to encourage the use of diplomatic channels in all respects.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Syria is, at this moment, experiencing a terrible period in its existence. A civil war is a war that divides communities and makes enemies of neighbours. Most of the time in a civil war, it is evil versus evil, just as it is in this case.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the one hand, we see a dictator and his friends who are clinging onto power. On the other hand, we see Islamic fundamentalists who have no desire to establish a proper democracy, but only to further spread political Islam throughout the region.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this is a time of significant change in the Middle East. I will briefly discuss three points: Changes are afoot in Egypt with the forthcoming presidential elections. I would like them to be clean, to take place without incident, and for the parties and society to accept the results. I would certainly have liked the Egyptian authorities to have invited European observers. Egypt is a key country in the Arab world. It is important for a multi-party system to be consolidated there in which the prosperity and freedoms of the Egyptian people are the main objective. Living together in tolerance, rather than radicalism or polarisation, will allow all Egyptians to exercise freedoms, including religious freedom. What are your hopes, Baroness Ashton, for these elections?</p>
      <p sl="es">In Israel, I would like the broader base of the new government to favour the opening of negotiations with the Palestinians, but I am sceptical about the launching of negotiations this year due to the continuing problem of the settlements, which you referred to along with the regional and international context, including the electoral outlook in the United States. Another reason I am sceptical is the way that Israel is focusing on the Iranian nuclear programme. However, I do not think that the deadlock is helping anyone. I do not think that the changes that have taken place in the region are going to provide Israel with a more favourable context in future for resuming the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will end by discussing Syria. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, things are not improving there, as has already been stated. Kofi Annan’s plan is not succeeding. The violence is only increasing, and is even seriously affecting children, and Kofi Annan’s plan is not supporting the opposition. I am afraid that President al-Assad’s government thinks that it can crush the revolution by force, and that in the end, the international community will accept it. It is essential that Russia and China place more pressure on the Syrian authorities to change their attitude. I would like you to tell us, Baroness Ashton, whether, at the recent summit with Russia at the weekend, you were able to glean whether there is any desire in Moscow to adjust its position.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be enough for political and institutional leaders to show their rightful indignation at the horrors unfolding in Syria, and I think you, Baroness Ashton, are aware of that. What is happening beyond our borders requires an appropriate response capacity, and frankly I do not think even the European Union as a whole has sufficient response capacity to meet the challenges facing us. How long must we stand and watch the massacre in Syria?</p>
      <p sl="it">We can understand all the current difficulties resulting from the fragile balance of power in the region; we can understand, yet not agree with, the positions of Russia and China, who will not allow the United Nations to take more incisive action; and we can also understand the mistrust in certain spheres in Europe towards the forces opposing Bashar al-Assad, not least because of their sources of funding. However, we cannot tolerate what is happening any longer. The European Union should go beyond its current activism and take a stronger lead. We have to disprove the idea that the Assad regime can do what it likes because the international community has shown itself to be impotent and that the European Union is too tied up in the economic and financial crisis to allow itself the luxury of intervening in the events in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="it">The decision to create a humanitarian corridor has not been put into practice. I think, though, we should make a fresh start on that and back up that decision with all the means at our disposal, bar none – and I stress, bar none – because that is a vital prerequisite for initiating the transition process and the transfer of power. We now need to turn our words into actions, and that is a task that is clearly yours to shoulder.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the High Representative spoke of the situation in Syria, which should concern us all. A ghastly human tragedy is unfolding: in Haffa, in Houla, in Hreitan, women and children are being shot at random, and children are being tortured – and allegedly even used as human shields. Violence is rife and, despite her attempt to revive its corpse, the Annan Plan is dead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, Syria has air defences much stronger than those of Libya; true, the opposition there is weak and divided, and nowhere in control. Indeed, troops will be needed on the ground. High Representative, this is no longer a time for seminars. The right to intervene and the responsibility to protect are part of UN doctrine. Ban Ki-moon can call on NATO or others to intervene, and on the International Criminal Court to investigate. You should urge him to.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, your words are hardly of any reassurance to me regarding the European Union’s capacity to take action. To be honest, it is calling on the opposition to unite for the umpteenth time, listing the risks that the situation presents for the umpteenth time, risks that have already been proven and are still very much present: regionalisation, militarisation, communitarisation, etc. These risks are also the result of the international community’s inability to have provided its support in good time to a people’s uprising against a dictator.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also believe that the situation is now so complicated and so difficult that there is no correct solution any more. However, inaction will cost us even more dearly. In other words, in three months’ time, we will be having the same old debate and you will be telling us how militarisation, communitarisation and regionalisation have been exacerbated further. Yes, we need to act then but there is no correct solution. Faced with the need and duty to protect the people, we are practically faced with the dilemma of having to choose whether we should violate international law by bypassing the Security Council. Yet we have to put all the options on the table.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I heard Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra talking about a force being present on the ground. I also heard what Ms Brantner had to say. These options need to be looked at. This is absolutely urgent. We then need to put pressure on Russia because Russia, I can assure you, is in a very comfortable position. Today in France, the largest arms-producing company is currently showing at the international exhibition of weapons, in Villepinte, with total impunity. I have not heard anyone in Europe or in France, or you yourselves, dispute this fact. I therefore think that Russia does not feel under any threat whatsoever. We all know it is about the carrot and the stick with Russia. What have you dangled in front of them in your discussions?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a BBC journalist reporting from Syria concluded sadly, but accurately, that what happened in Houla at the end of May is terrible but is not unique.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only yesterday, another one hundred people, many of them children, are estimated to have died across the country in this conflict that is sliding right into outright civil war.</p>
      <p sl="en">The origins of the uprising in Syria as a genuine popular movement against the al-Assad police state and against the rule of the crooked elite have been increasingly forgotten by all of the dominant forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sectarianism is deepening and there is a real danger of a conflict based on sectarian lines spilling over into other countries in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">As always, it is working people, the poor and children who suffer the most and the crocodile tears of sympathy from the imperialist powers, in my opinion, are deeply sickening, deeply hypocritical considering that the day after the Houla massacre, a NATO drone strike in Afghanistan killed eight members of one family.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, the US is using the failure of the so-called six-point peace plan to threaten action outside of it. One thing needs to be very clear: any military intervention, regardless of how it is dressed up, regardless of how it is disguised, will not ease the suffering of the Syrian people. The answer can only be a movement that unites working and poor people in Syria, regardless of religious and ethnic background, which can meet the aspirations of the participants in the uprising of March 2011.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, there is an oft-quoted saying that the problem with the world is not so much all the bad, but the silence of the good. Although the international community has not been entirely silent, frustration and powerlessness must be the words that best describe its feelings regarding the situation in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is distressing that all we can do is read the reports by UN military observers on the ever-growing numbers of civilian victims, and the continuous bloodshed and human rights violations. They report that Syrian Government troops are carrying out planned attacks on civilians. In other words, the purpose is to kill civilians.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now, for the first time, the United Nations has added Syrian Government troops to the list of those who recruit, kill and exploit children in armed conflicts. It is quite clear that the EU must use all the influence it has with Russia and China. However, the Arab countries also have a crucial role to play, especially Jordan.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The situation in Syria is causing growing uncertainty throughout the region. In Lebanon, for example, the army has now managed to end the violence against religious groups. The Alawites and Sunnis have been fighting one another, and it is particularly the supporters of al-Assad and his opponents who have been involved.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is estimated that 78 000 people have fled to neighbouring countries.

      <p sl="en">However, the window for a two-state solution is closing rapidly as the peace process is faltering. Israel continues to develop and construct illegal settlements – illegal under international law – on the West Bank. Planning and zoning laws have been used with impunity to dispossess the Palestinian people of East Jerusalem and destroy infrastructure throughout the West Bank, often built with EU funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mining and quarrying activities deemed also to be illegal under international law are continuing apace at a cost of 720 000 to the Palestinian authority.</p>

How can we preserve East Jerusalem as a future capital of two states? How can we ensure that there will be a cessation of evictions and demolitions in Area C? How can we prevent the spread of illegal settlements? And can we ensure the release of administrative detainees unless they have actually been charged with criminal offences under law?</p>

The crisis exit strategy is not effective, despite the concerted efforts of many countries and international organisations.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have just been reminded of the tragic figures; Syria is being martyred while barbarity is invited to the table of a regime clinging on to power. Bashar al-Assad no longer has any hesitation now in using children as human shields. This was established in a report published this morning by the United Nations. In the face of this, words and declarations are no longer enough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our diplomatic tack has clearly failed. We must go further, change tack, more than likely with an international peacekeeping force, so that all these innocent victims have not died in vain, and so that one day the Syrian regime will be put on trial for its crimes, so that the European Union admits that, at present, there is no possible compromise with the Moscow-Damascus-Tehran axis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I join Mr Millán Mon, Commissioner, in asking: what resources do we have, how can we force its hand so that the European Union finally invests more in preventive diplomacy and brings to bear all its influence to reduce the risk of war spreading across the region – and I am thinking, obviously, about Lebanon? Ms De Keyser has already mentioned this and I share her concerns completely.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it is right that we have highlighted the dreadful human rights situation in Syria and that we have expressed the fear that the conflict there could turn into a civil war. I believe that it already is a civil war. The attacks on the civilian population and on women and children are absolutely unbearable.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we should be aware that we need a policy which enables us to isolate Assad from his own people. We must make it clear not to him, but to his followers, that he has no future. This is always what is needed to ensure that a system implodes. The specific task and the responsibility of China and Russia lie in this area. They must make their position clearer, so that Assad does not believe that he has a refuge there and that he can continue to hold out as he has been doing. It must be made obvious to his followers that they should distance themselves from him if they want to have a future, so that a peaceful solution can be reached within Syria, which is not possible with Assad in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I also think that Qatar, Saudi Arabia and many other Arab countries have a specific responsibility in this area. They are obviously supplying weapons and selectively funding the opposition, as they did during the elections in Egypt, with the aim of encouraging the Islamisation of the country.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is essential that we make countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which always presents itself in an official context as a liberal state, publicly aware of their responsibilities, that we no longer accept the game that they are playing, that they take a specific responsibility in this area and that, in this way, we enable the Arab League to play a more effective role. In other words, we must involve the United Nations, China and Russia in order to achieve our first objective and make it clear that Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other countries have a responsibility. If we in the West decide to take military action, we must understand that the situation is quite different from that in Libya, both in terms of the population and the country’s geography. However, we should also make it clear that the rights of minorities must be safeguarded under all circumstances. The Christians in Syria are worried because they feel threatened by some parts of the opposition. We need to take this into account if we are to find a sensible solution.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Lady Ashton, the debate today is rightly dedicated in the main to the terrible situation in Syria, but I would also like to call your attention to the situation in Egypt. Several weeks ago, a delegation of ours visited Egypt and we were able to see the complex situation there for ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You are aware of the fact that, next week, in a second round of presidential elections, the Egyptian people will be asked to choose between two extremes: on the one hand, the old regime in the form of Mr Shafiq, Mr Mubarak’s former Prime Minister, and, on the other, the Muslim Brotherhood, whose position is becoming stronger as the party has already won the first round of the elections some months ago.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Obviously, this is frustrating and it is a very difficult dilemma for those who had hoped for a real change. Meanwhile, state coffers are lying empty and it is not clear how much real power the future president will have, because Egypt still needs a new constitution. All of this shows that the transition process is sluggish. Many people are looking at Egypt and wondering if they really will be able to pull it off. Probably, a great deal will depend on improving the economic situation for the average Egyptian because there are many people who are waiting for their situation to improve.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lady Ashton, I would like to know your view on the situation in Egypt and the additional developments there, especially given the scepticism of a considerable number of political actors towards the ‘more for more’ principle.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it was only on 8 June that you condemned settlement building in the occupied territories. Today, you referred for the umpteenth time to the fact that settlement building is illegal under the terms of international law. Furthermore, on 14 May, the Council reaffirmed in its conclusions on the peace process the fact that we must maintain the viability of a two-state solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it is incomprehensible that we in the European Parliament are now being asked to vote in favour of the additional protocol to the association agreement with Israel on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA). I think it is particularly important to make the following point. We have not yet had a clear explanation of the precise way in which products manufactured in the settlements are handled in the agreement between the EU and Israel. These products are still finding their way onto the EU market. Before we conclude any further trade agreements with Israel, we need to resolve this problem. We must investigate whether there are any effective mechanisms for monitoring this which can be introduced and implemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the meantime, Israel continues to disregard its obligations under international law. More settlements are being built, enlarged and even relocated as Israel sees fit, while the EU stands helplessly by. A two-state solution is quite literally being buried under the settlements.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I will, of course, once again start with football. It is difficult to sit and watch football matches while knowing that every day, dozens of people are being killed in Syria and that it is not just soldiers, but also civilians, including women and children. I think everybody here has now realised that President Assad long ago ceased to be the hope of Europe or America as regards improving the human rights situation or democratisation and economic development in Syria. We are all aware of the fact that President Assad is, quite simply, murdering his own people. I expect that we also realise – I think that this is something of which we are becoming increasingly aware – that the time may soon be upon us when the only solution will be military involvement. I am not talking about what kind of involvement, its scope or the when and how, but merely that it could happen. Naturally, the agreement of the UN would be required for this, and for this reason I would like to address a question to the High Representative: what are the possibilities for a change in the Russian and Chinese positions? I also have another question, as I believe that there is another country in this region which is extremely significant and interested in a positive resolution to the Syrian situation, namely Turkey. I would like to ask if the High Representative is undertaking consultations with the Turkish authorities on this issue?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am going to make a different proposal from supporting a plan that, as has been said here today, is as dead as the Syrian children. I am sure you have heard of Rosoboronexport , Baroness Ashton. It is the Russian arms trade agency that is backed by the State, for which it makes thousands of millions in profits. It is also the main supplier of arms to Syria, and its other main clients are the United States and India.</p>
      <p sl="es">Perhaps Russia – and I do not know whether you raised this issue during the recent EU-Russia Summit in St Petersburg – will adjust its position in the United Nations Security Council if, through the influence that we should have on India and other clients of this Russian state company, its profits from the sale of arms are threatened.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, perhaps also the European Union – as part of the international community – as well as the United Nations, Kofi Annan and his plan, which has failed, will save ourselves from being condemned by the international community for failing in our duty to help the Syrian people, as I believe that is already the case.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Madam High Representative, the entire international community is watching the events in Syria, which are now spreading beyond the country’s borders and affecting its neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to join my colleagues in firmly condemning the repeated bombings and attacks which have been responsible for the death of thousands of civilians, and in denouncing the attitude of the Syrian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dialogue, pressure or sanctions have shown their limits and proved unable to put an end to the unacceptable acts committed in Syria. We all know that only concerted action within the framework of the United Nations can lead to a solution in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know which countries are so far blocking any conclusion or demands for action at Union level – namely Russia and China.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam High Representative, I would therefore ask one question: could you present us, in detail, with your views and approach towards China and Russia when it comes to the situation in Syria and, more generally, concerning the latest developments in the Middle East?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are talking about Syria and we are saying that there is too much talk and too little action. I agree with my fellow Members, as it is fortunately not often that we talk about such terrible things here. We should not be sparing with our words of condemnation, and not just for Assad but also for all those who support him, because those governments that are supporting President Assad are also committing a crime. We are faced with an appalling and terrible dictatorship in this very day and age. I also agree with all those who have said that we must use all available and acceptable methods to save people from death and suffering and to save the wonderful Syrian culture from destruction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Yet Syria has a neighbour, a country that is prospering, democratic and developing very well, and this neighbour is Israel. I heard a speech by President Perez where he spoke of assistance for the development of democracy, for economic growth and for the construction of a modern society in neighbouring countries. He was speaking in the context of the Arab Spring in North African countries. This would be the dream. I imagine that Palestine, the inhabitants of the West Bank, they too could provide assistance to neighbouring countries. Yet the failed and stalled peace process between Israel and Palestine constantly draws our attention away from these terrible events in the region. We talk about settlements, we talk about trade agreements and we talk about the destruction of humanitarian aid instead of speaking about how these two communities could provide added value in stabilising the region. I would thus call on the governments of Israel and Palestine to sit down at the negotiating table, as peace in your region is what is needed most.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, before I say something about Syria, I would like to thank you and the members of your team, who have done such a good job on the ground, for all your efforts. We no longer know where to begin when dealing with the problems of the region.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is going on in Syria is already a civil war. We should not be under any illusions. Children are being used and abused as human shields and house-to-house fighting is already raging. When people call for military intervention in Syria, it is important to remember that this is not the same situation as in Libya. Nothing can be achieved there with a no-fly zone. The conflict involves house-to-house and street-to-street fighting and I do not believe that any army in the world would be prepared to go in there and take this task on.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must make it clear to Assad and his clan that there is no solution left for him. He cannot survive as president. He must be summoned before the International Criminal Court. We must ensure that the Syrian regime becomes increasingly isolated and the key to achieving this lies in Russia and China, but also in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. We need to increase the pressure in these areas. The international community must make its views clearer and give its support to the UN. We would like to call on you to do this and we will be happy to continue supporting you.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this discussion simply shows how helpless we are and how little we are really able to do. Immense changes have taken place in this exceptionally troubled part of the world and a huge amount of chaos has followed these changes. It is possible that, at some time, something great will come out of this chaos, but at present, the chaos also involves great risks. Someone has switched off the magnetic poles. When they are working, we usually know which way is north and which way is south, we know who is good and who is evil, who is the aggressor and who is trying to defend themselves. Today, we cannot tell. The old world of Arab regimes has gone. It has gone and this last regime, the Syrian one, is also going; it is just a matter of time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this situation, can we do any more than support all those who are working in favour of democracy, who are creating some sort of foundations for peace? Can we do any more than support democrats in Israel and Palestine? Can we do any more than strive to make sure that parties to peace treaties, such as treaties with Egypt and those between Israel and Jordan, keep their promises? Let us remember that this is a time in which something that is stable, democratic and predictable is a value in itself.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would warn all those who believe that Israeli settlements, which I do not support, are a threat to peace. These are the same people who are blind to the rockets fired into Israel from Gaza or to the Iranian military programme. This is, quite simply, a mistake.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, clearly the topic of today is Syria. Every day, we hear of new horrible things, such as children being used as human shields. It shows the weaknesses that exist in the UN system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue which demonstrates this is the long lasting Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We in the EU remain committed to a two-state solution, as confirmed in recent Council conclusions on the Middle East peace process. However, current trends are deeply worrying, especially concerning the use of administrative detention by the Israeli Government, which is used to imprison Palestinians without charge or evidence against them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many prisoners are kept in isolated cells for 23 hours a day. Despite declarations from the Israeli Government to end administrative detention, this practice is still going on. This is unacceptable in a country claiming to uphold the rule of law. Ms Ashton, have you brought this issue up with your contacts in the region?</p>

      <p sl="de">The Israeli Government claims that it is in favour of a responsible peace process and a two-state solution, but the reality looks rather different. The Gaza Strip is still an open-air prison. The EU and the United Nations are constantly providing more money to feed the people in Gaza and the Israeli army has destroyed aid projects set up by the EU in occupied Palestinian territory in recent years which cost EUR 50 million. The aim of these aid projects was to provide better living conditions for the Palestinians and they included schools, infrastructure and education projects. We owe it to our taxpayers in the EU to make it clear to the Israelis that this situation has to change and that Israel’s settlement policy must finally come to an end.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Syrian crisis is horrifying, not only because of the sheer brutality and scale of the violence, but because there is no silver bullet solution. No single policy or action, whether a military intervention or a diplomatic solution, could halt the massacre and ensure a peaceful transition of power.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should keep up the oil embargo and intensify sanctions, encourage Turkey to be more active and support all constructive proposals put forward by Kofi Annan, including the contact group idea. Above all, the EU should draw Russia, which, after all, is our strategic partner, more closely into the process, and not just put pressure on it to change its position, but allow Moscow to play a positive and constructive role in Syria.

The Syrian Government, however, is not the only guilty party: the armed forces of the Syrian opposition have recruited children, at least for assistance. I support the sanctions imposed by the Council on the Syrian authorities and Syrian companies, but now really is the time for the international community to begin thinking about what will work and what will not.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Syrian civilians have now suffered too much and, as children and young people have become political pawns, it is time for the international community to wake up to the seriousness of the situation, even if not everyone is involved. Kofi Annan will not make it through the negotiations without political support.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would also hope that the regular Quartet talks will get back on track.

The Libyan crisis was a typical crisis that can only be solved through international intervention, with the Blue Helmets and with a large mandate to separate parties and to stop violence that comes mostly from tyrannical governments that will one day have to answer for these crimes to the international courts.</p>
      <p sl="en">In tandem with this, we have violence by rebels using heavy armaments who are funded by foreign countries and who are armed through covert operations.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, it is true that we are all horrified by brutal attacks, but these brutal attacks that are angering everyone are, unfortunately, one of the practices that armed terrorist groups have been carrying out in Syria. As is well known, documented and discussed, these same groups are financed, supported and armed by the United States and by various fundamentalist dictators, in a campaign of aggression, intervention and destabilisation that has been going on for more than a year. These are terrorist groups that form part of al-Qaeda, as Ban Ki-moon himself has admitted. The same al-Qaeda that served as the pretext for the US invasion of Afghanistan, and is now paving the way for the Member States and other client states to be able to invade Syria.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The campaign has not, it must be said, taken a particularly original form. Humanity has already witnessed the use of falsifications and conspiracies several times – Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya – to justify bloody wars of aggression and occupation.

I would like to ask this question: in the light of the lack of clarity concerning the situations in Egypt and Iran, what does the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, think about greater activation of, and involvement with, the Arab League in order to resolve the crises and problems in the Arab world that we have to deal with now and with which we shall have to deal in the future? There has been a proposal to form a quintet instead of a quartet. What is your view on this? I believe that this could be a way to reach into the heart of Moscow, as it would appear that Russia does not find the sight of all these murders convincing or encouraging enough to cooperate in resolving this crisis. Perhaps a commitment to activate the Arab League would be a way to get through to Russia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Baroness Ashton for her part in securing the Council conclusions on the Middle East peace process of 14 May because I think they are a good illustration of how strong support for Israel’s security and close engagement with Israel – as well, of course, for the two-state solution – is entirely consistent with outspoken criticism of illegalities and human rights abuses by Israel, such as illegal settlement, forced transfer of Bedouins, home demolitions and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is my own position, which is why I support approval of the ACAA (agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products) Protocol on recognition of pharmaceutical products, while feeling entirely free to reproach Israel on some matters, as well as Palestinians on some others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could I ask, in the context of the High Representative mentioning her condemnation of administrative detention in Israel, whether she will call for Mahmoud al-Sarsak and other prisoners on prolonged hunger strike to be admitted to civilian hospitals for specialised medical care, and whether she will call on Israel to release administrative detainees unless they are promptly charged and brought to fair trial?</p>
      <p sl="en">I should add that we also need to be outspoken about what the Carnegie Endowment has recently called the unaccountable and authoritarian Hamas Government in Gaza.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is a fact that more than 300 000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and this situation cannot, and should not, be reversed. It is also a fact that Palestinian settlements are funded by the EU. However, in 2011, the Israeli army destroyed more than 60 Palestinian structures in the West Bank which were built using EU money. These included houses, wells and agricultural facilities. Infrastructure projects subsidised by the EU must not be destroyed under any circumstances because actions of this kind naturally give rise to reactions on both sides. The recipe for peace and stability in this region consists not of more money, but primarily of dialogue and mutual respect. The EU must once again put pressure on both sides in the conflict in this regard. This does not mean that the EU should be throwing large sums of money at this area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, there have been several crisis areas in the Middle East recently. However, we must not overlook relations between Israel and Palestine because they have an impact on stability in the entire region. I would like to stress once again that the EU’s policy in this area must be constructive and avoid, first and foremost, heightening tensions. It must demonstrate balance and reaffirm the support for the solution with the two states coexisting in peace and security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to ask you, Lady Ashton, whether there has been any dialogue with Israel following the critical conclusions reached by the last Council on the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, I am interested in learning your view on the reforms initiated peacefully by Jordan. Do you think that they may also have a positive influence on other states in the region?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to ask you not to let all the speeches calling either directly or indirectly for military intervention make too much of an impression on you. It is significant that none of these Members mentioned how many soldiers would be provided by Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom and all the other speakers’ countries for house-to-house fighting, which is what would be facing these troops in Syria. They also failed to say how much military equipment would be needed and what costs these countries would incur, some of which are currently in the process of making use of the rescue package. No one has said anything about who should pay for all of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is highly characteristic of the entire debate. Furthermore, no one has referred to the fact that Syria is not on the Hindu Kush and that a war or an open military conflict in Syria would have quite different effects on the neighbouring regions, in particular, on Israel and Palestine, than is the case in Afghanistan. This is all simply warmongering and I would ask you not to take it too much to heart.</p>

    <intervention id="2-473-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Catherine Ashton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am conscious that there are seven debates this evening, of which this is the fourth, but it is one where so much has been said that I feel I need to give a fairly detailed response. However, I shall try to do so briefly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whatever frustration and concern you feel, I promise you that that is magnified by the conversations which go on every hour of every day between ourselves – the Member States, with other countries in the region, with Kofi Annan, with Ban Ki-moon, and with all of those who are really desperately trying to find a way through in Syria. A way through that will enable the people to achieve first of all peace – a ceasefire – and then a transition to a government that will have their interests at heart, and that they have chosen.</p>
      <p sl="en">Everything that we do is designed and geared to try to achieve that, so I understand your passion, and I share it. I understand your frustration, and I share it. But we really have got to think very carefully about how we try to achieve that outcome as swiftly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we have been debating, we know that a group of observers in Syria have been met by stone throwing, and it appears that they have been fired on and have retreated from an area in Syria. All the time that we are speaking, we are very conscious that the situation on the ground is as bad as it possibly can be.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to try to address three or four key areas that honourable Members have raised and give my response to them, while bearing in mind that finding solutions is extraordinarily difficult.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first is on sanctions. Every day, we look at what more we can do to continue to put the economic pressure on the regime that prevents it from doing some of the things it would like, that demonstrates international concern and commitment, and that shows to those in Syria who may not yet have realised it that this regime is going to go, and that the international community and the EU are united in their response to the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also true that we are supporting the arms embargo. We have asked all countries to observe this, and are working closely with the UN under Chapter 7.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the Opposition, we speak to everybody at all levels – the Syrian National Council, the National Coordination Committee – and we are supporting the efforts led by the Arab League, and also what Turkey is doing to try to bring the opposition together. We have talked about umbrella groups, we have talked about representative groups: all manner of ideas to try and get some kind of cohesion and unity between the different groups about what it is they are trying to do. It is very challenging, and yet it is so necessary to be able to demonstrate and bring leadership for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the Kofi Annan plan: well, you can declare it dead if you want to, but Kofi Annan has a mandate from the United Nations. He is trying to find ways to bring about his six-point plan and to think of alternative ways to bring the international community together, and I will continue to support him in those efforts until he says, or the United Nations says, that we have stopped doing that and we are moving on. That does not mean that he or I do not realise how difficult it is. I have had the good fortune to speak many times on the phone with him, and I know his frustration. I know how hard he is trying to make things work, but what he has asked us to do is to support him in the ways he is trying to bring everyone together, and I will do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it comes to the contact group that Kofi Annan is proposing to set up, he has not yet quite determined what its membership will be. So I do not know what is going to happen precisely, or who will be there. I will be there, and I know that Russia will be there; it will take place in Geneva on 30 June, and in between times, Kofi Annan is trying to build support to stop the civil war from getting worse and to try and at least achieve some unity of purpose to ensure influence in the region is targeted at trying to prevent that outcome. I think we should support him in that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have to make a really strong distinction between observers and peacekeepers: they are not the same thing. What we have on the ground are observers. They are not peacekeepers. Their mandate is limited to observation and, as we have just learned, they put themselves at risk in so doing. Kofi Annan worries a great deal that we do not make the distinction clear enough. If we are going to move to do anything involving peacekeepers, then we had better be absolutely clear what mandate it is that we are giving them and who is mandating them to operate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Syrian army is 200 000 to 300 000 strong and well-armed, so talk of military action needs to be thought through extremely carefully in what is a very complex situation on the ground. We have to work step by step, and carefully, to try to resolve this situation peacefully. We have to put pressure on the regime; we have to get those who have influence to put pressure on the regime; we have to get the opposition to unite; we have to get a ceasefire that will hold – because until you have a ceasefire, you cannot keep the peace, because there is none – and we have to be clear and sure about what it is we are trying to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, of course, raise this with all partners. At the EU-Russia Summit we talked about Syria, and we have expressed over and over again our desire to see Russia join the Security Council. That, again, is what some of the meetings I attended last week in Turkey were about, and what many of the dialogues are aimed at: getting us to the point where the maximum pressure is successfully brought to bear on trying to stop the violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Middle East process, I agree with much of what has been said. There is no request that I am aware of concerning the Arab League wanting to be a member of the Quartet, but the Arab peace initiative follow-up committee has met with the Quartet on a number of occasions and I have no doubt that it will continue to do so. But I do agree that regional involvement is very important. It is why we have been very clear in support of what Jordan has been trying to do, to act as broker between the two.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do raise the issues of administrative detention, both publicly, in our statements, and in all the contacts that we have. Particular cases have been raised. Mahmoud Sarsak – for those who do not already know this – ended his hunger strike yesterday, on what was the 85th day. That has been reported to our delegation by the prison service there. But, of course, there are many people in detention and we have made clear to Israel our view that the issue is disproportionate and we need to have certainty about the future of those people.</p>
      <p sl="en">We talk to Israel all the time. There is a constant flow of information to and from us, and a constant flow of contacts. We do recognise the importance of the security of Israel. We want Israel to be a successful country. We want a two-state solution that includes Israel, and we want to see Israel recognise its international obligations and move forward on the peace process in its own interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is my view, and I have made this clear to all of my Israeli contacts, to all the people I know there, that if you want a secure Israel, solving the issues between them and the Palestinians forms part of that security. That was never more true than now, with all the changes and challenges that are going on in the region, all the concerns that Israel has – not least about Iran – and all the changes too in the neighbourhood, which change the nature of the political and economic pressure being exerted. I believe that is really important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recognise what the Netherlands has done in Gaza. That is important, but we need real trade in Gaza, we need to have the crossings open to allow the import and export of goods to build an economy in which people can invest. That, I think, is something we have discussed many times.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just want to say a very few words about Egypt, and to start with Asmaa Mahfouz. Our delegation is in contact all the time with her and with her lawyers, but there is no doubt that these next days in Egypt are going to be crucial for the transition. Today, we have the revised Constituent Assembly. It looks as if it will be more representative than its predecessor, but the challenges of agreeing a constitution by December are formidable, and the constitution is so important. There will be two important judgments on Thursday about the running of Ahmed Shafik in the second round and whether the parliamentary elections from last November will stand. Then, of course, there will be the run-off on Saturday and Sunday. So there is enormous uncertainty in the country, but I hope that what we will end up with is someone whom we can see has a democratic mandate. We work with all those who share our values and principles wherever they come from, whatever faith they have, as long as they believe in human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the principles and values that we have.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I just want to say that we could have talked about other countries – Morocco is a good example of a country going through change, and which we have not forgotten – but I do hope that honourable Members will stay committed to trying to support the people of Syria in the way that we have witnessed in this House this evening. It is so important that we do everything we possibly can to stop a situation that is much worse than we can even imagine.</p>

      <p sl="en">Nothing has exposed the deficiencies of the United Nations – since the end of the cold war – more than the crises in Syria. The Security Council, namely its structure and veto system, is completely hampered. Every so often, we hear statements from the General Secretary stating the obvious and, in the meantime, thousands die. I may sound pessimistic but the only conclusion I can come to is that the system does not work unless there is complete agreement amongst the main international stakeholders. When this is absent, then the only prior is the hope that time will solve the problem. And, in the meantime, thousands die. If there was ever a misnomer, it is the title of this organisation. It is everything but a union of Nations. It is disunited and far from able to get to grips with problems and, in the meantime, thousands die.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The situation in Syria and its regional and global implications are extremely complex, on a number of levels. Firstly, our duty to respond to the atrocities suffered by Syrians at the hands of the al-Assad regime conflicts with the need for an international political strategy for joint external action and with the general willingness to exhaust all possibilities for a peaceful resolution. Secondly, faced with human tragedy, thousands of people have fled the country, which represents significant pressure on neighbouring countries and demands urgent humanitarian assistance. Thirdly, Syria’s role on the regional stage is crucial for the security situation in the Middle East, in particular, for Israel, which is seeing a growing extremist and anti-Israeli threat at its borders. Lastly, the rise of religious extremism and the strengthening of fundamentalist terrorist groups represent a global threat which we cannot ignore. Baroness Ashton, the EU must be proactive and do its utmost to support the efforts of Mr Annan, but it must also know where to draw the ‘red line’ and encourage all international partners to take the necessary steps, including considering military intervention, if Mr al-Assad continues along this barbaric road.</p>

      <p sl="en">When King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Strasbourg about two month ago, the situation in Syria looked somehow ‘stabilised’, with the regime still in control. The Kofi Annan mission looked poised to bring relief to the embattled people of Syria and both Russia and China seemed inclined to contemplate the cost of sustaining the Assad regime to the end. Two months later, all that is gone. The bloodshed continues at even higher levels, the regime is holding fiercely onto power, Kofi Annan’s plan has become questionable and Russia, in particular, has toughened its stance to the point of preventing any potential external intervention to relieve the Syrians of this nightmare. After all, the international community was able to unite and act – see Bosnia and Kosovo – in situations that were not apparently as bad as that existing in Syria today. Still, with all those shortcomings, the Annan Plan seems to be all that we have got, because, in Lady Ashton’s words, ‘No other option has been able to gather any kind of international support’. Sad, but true, this is how international politics works. The question is, how will we look into the eyes of the ordinary Syrians when all this is over?</p>

      <p sl="it">Many people would like to see a new role for European policy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We all want Europe to promote more effective peace initiatives than have happened so far and to take on a political role more in tune with our financial commitments in the area. To achieve that in such a complicated and difficult situation, the European Union must be seen as credible and unbiased by both parties. Both the Palestinians and the Israelis must be convinced that the Union is only interested in peace and is not prejudiced against either side. Do we really think that the European Union can be regarded as a credible partner by Israel in light of the recent consensual positions reached by the Foreign Affairs Council last May, which totally ignored Israel’s legitimate security demands, surrounded as it is by hostile countries? At a time when the hopes raised by the Arab Spring are being dashed and we see Islamic extremism prevailing in the Maghreb countries, what security assurances can be given by the new Palestinian state if it comes into being, which, by the way, is what we all hope will happen?</p>

      <p sl="pl">The conflict in Syria has been going on for 15 months now, and the number of those killed from the beginning of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad is now over 14 000. The government in Damascus is still using violence against its own people, who should be the top priority in any system and in any country. The present situation has even been compared to a civil war, in which the parties are, on the one hand, the country and, on the other, a regime that is using ever newer methods in its fight against the opposition, struggling to maintain its grip on power at all costs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Moreover, despite the efforts of the international community, this conflict has not yet been resolved, which could significantly weaken the impact of this type of peaceful intervention. Yet NATO is not planning any military solutions; instead, it emphasises that priority must be given to political approaches. What is needed is to reach agreement within the United Nations and to develop a joint plan of action that could stop blood from being spilt and bring Syria out of the paralysing chaos in which it finds itself. The Syrian nation wants to follow a democratic path, as proven by its determination and sacrifices. The assistance provided by the international community should, however, be more decisive and more forceful calls should be made for concrete action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the Democratic Republic of Congo is a country that demonstrates the importance of the EU engagement being long term, if it is to be productive, and where – over time – we can make a difference.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to focus my remarks on two issues: the democratic follow-up after the November 2011 elections and the security and humanitarian situation in eastern Congo.</p>
      <p sl="en">The DRC is a fragile state and a very young democracy. It is still recovering from years of war and deprivation. The road to recovery and stabilisation is not straightforward, but we are determined to persevere in supporting the DRC in consolidating its democracy and accelerating its development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2006 elections were a milestone in their progress towards a more democratic future, but were achieved with huge support from the international community.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2011 elections, by contrast, were primarily funded and organised by the DRC itself. The challenges remained great, the execution may not have been perfect, but this is an achievement that we should recognise. We continue to provide support for the electoral process through a contribution of EUR 47.5 million and by sending an EU electoral observation mission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the commitment and hard work of that mission, led by honourable Member Mariya Nedelcheva. They carried out the work in extremely difficult circumstances and a final report has been well received by everyone in the DRC. They highlighted the fact that the scale of irregularities and fraud weakened, if not undermined, the credibility of the outcome, and that there was a need for significant reforms and improvements in the future. Nevertheless, in present circumstances, all stakeholders have recognised that it would be impossible to recount the votes or organise a new round of elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, our priority is to follow up the valuable recommendations for future reforms that are in the report. This will be an important element of our dialogue between the EU and the DRC Government. In the short term, we expect to see significant improvements for the provincial and local elections that will follow in the coming years. Therefore, we want to engage more closely with the government to ensure that we improve the democratic process and the country’s governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am encouraged by the recent appointment of Mr Ponyo Matata as Prime Minister and the new ministers that will work with him. He has worked closely with the EU in the past and he has a good record as finance minister of the previous government and as a national authorising officer of the European Development Fund. The commitments he made in his inaugural speech are particularly encouraging and they open the prospect for a political dialogue and progress in improved governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our Head of Delegation has already met several ministers of the new government and is beginning to work closely with them. Initial impressions are very positive. But, of course, we want action, not just commitments. We have significant development assistance, which we want to use and we want to use it as productively as possible in facing the challenges of the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, over the past three years, the situation in the eastern Congo has improved. But it is still extremely fragile and, as recent events have shown, there remains a risk of sliding back into war and disorder. Our priority is to work together with our international partners and with the governments of the region to try and prevent this from happening.</p>
      <p sl="en">The mutiny by some elements in the Congolese armed forces – effectively, former rebels returning to the bush – has caused renewed fighting in the Kivus. I am appalled by, and strongly condemn, the recent mass killings by several armed groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">One consequence of this has been a sharp increase in the number of internally displaced people in the last few months. We now have over two million people. Our humanitarian assistance already amounts to EUR 63 million in this year but, clearly, the humanitarian crisis is not over.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are committed to the unity and sovereignty of the DRC. We condemn the rebellion and strongly support the restoration of the authority of the state, and that needs to take into account the legitimate concerns of the DRC’s neighbours. In that context, I am worried about recent reports of developments that might put at risk the positive regional dynamic between the DRC and Rwanda, and weaken their cooperation. That has been so important to underpin the progress in eastern Congo in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clear messages have been passed to all in order to encourage a constructive approach in these circumstances, and we recall the need for all illegal armed groups to lay down their weapons and avoid further violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regional cooperation is essential, too, to tackle a number of the problems of the Great Lakes region, including the illegal exploitation of natural resources – conflict minerals – and the provision of improved energy supplies for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">We support the activities of MONUSCO in the DRC and we welcome the renewal of their mandate at the end of June. The protection of civilians in the east will remain an important mission for them in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there will be no sustainable peace without the rule of law and the application of justice. This is why I welcome and support the arrest warrant launched by the prosecutor against General Ntaganda. This is a clear sign that impunity will not prevail and, I hope, sends a signal of hope for the people who are suffering at the hands of the armed groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our contribution to the reconstruction of the judicial system is an integral part of the wider campaign against gender-based violence in the DRC. Everyone should know that these crimes can and will be punished. But our programme aims equally to tackle the root causes as well as the symptoms of this problem. We have supported action to keep the DRC on the agenda of the Human Rights Council and to encourage the government to cooperate with that council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Security sector reform, too, continues to be crucial. We are contributing through the operation of two missions: EUSEC, which supports military restructuring, and EUPOL, helping to reform the police. I look forward to continuing to contribute to it through the most appropriate instruments, taking into account the UN’s peacekeeping mission’s future mandate. But we can only have success on security sector reform with the commitment of the DRC at all levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I want to reiterate that the EU is committed for the long term to supporting the DRC and the Great Lakes region to escape the conflicts of the past and build a sustainable, more prosperous and peaceful future. It is the people of the DRC we are determined to help, and to do so through a comprehensive approach that tackles the many interlinked problems that they face.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will persevere.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, what you have just said is encouraging, which I welcome, but let us return to the elections.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before I begin, I would again like to pay tribute to the Congolese people, who mobilised on a massive scale for the presidential and legislative elections in November 2011, thereby proving to the entire international community and to their authorities how committed they are to building a true democracy in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU Election Observation Mission, which I had the honour of heading, presented its final report on 29 March this year. One of the responses from the Congolese authorities was to declare that the EU was ‘only pushing an open door’. I assume, therefore, that it is thanks to these ‘open doors’ that the EU mission managed to observe the irregularities and violence which, unfortunately, characterised a large part of this election. However, the recommendations that we have now made involve fundamental reforms. They are feasible and coherent. They need to be put in place, and in the shortest time possible, because the issue is not only that the elections take place, but, more importantly, that they take place under the right conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To do this, we must contemplate restructuring the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Congolese citizens deserve an independent INEC that observes the electoral timetable and complies with electoral law, that manages the election budget with complete transparency, and that respects all the parties involved in the electoral process. The establishment of a Constitutional Court and the transparent management of election disputes would greatly increase the citizens’ confidence in their own institutions, just like ours.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The establishment of political dialogue that includes all political parties and civil society, and that serves as the basis for responsible behaviour by all, is needed to finally work towards the country’s democratic, economic and social development. Respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, tackling the Impunity Law and ensuring the safety of all are challenges yet to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU must carry on shouldering responsibility and focus particularly on monitoring. It is important that the Congolese authorities and citizens know they can count on us, yet at the same time, we must stand firm in our stance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, do not be afraid to put forward the principle of conditionality. Both Congolese citizens and European citizens are behind you. They will thank you for it.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, once again, we are discussing the Democratic Republic of Congo in this House. Despite the fact that we are doing so due to the recently held elections there, we must condemn the fresh period of violence that followed the elections and the barbaric violence that continues in many areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">The violence and human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo must be strongly condemned by the European Union. This violence, the victims of which are always the most vulnerable – women and children – should incite anger in us. Therefore, Baroness, I ask for the fight against impunity to be one of the priorities in our cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo. This fight requires major reforms in the country’s justice system, in the training of judges and in victim support, as well as initiatives aimed at a national reconciliation strategy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to mention the need for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes for former fighters to be kept up, as otherwise we shall not be dealing with many of the deep-rooted causes of the violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you said, the final report of the EU Electoral Observation Mission contains a good number of valuable contributions that will promote transparency and the consolidation of democracy in the country.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to draw your attention, Baroness Ashton, to the fact that the Independent National Electoral Commission, which has been harshly criticised, received financial support from the European Union. For this reason, I ask that efforts be redoubled in order to prevent sectors and programmes that receive EU support from being able to act at their own discretion.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will conclude by stressing the synergetic relationship that exists between development, the protection of human rights and the consolidation of peace and security. The Democratic Republic of Congo is no exception to this. We must continue to work on all three fronts if we want to make progress in that country.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, given that the text of this resolution is rooted in the presidential and legislative elections of 2011, the draft resolution should have been submitted to plenary the day after the election.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, despite this delay, the abuses observed in the running of institutions and in the electoral process are of continuing relevance and require a response on our part to prevent a similar situation from happening again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first test of credibility, in the short-term, will be the provincial, urban, municipal and local elections, to be held between now and 2014. This agenda for these elections was defined and confirmed on 6 June 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament calls on the European Union to link the funding of future electoral processes with the effective implementation of recommendations as defined by the EU election observation missions. We need to stand even firmer in this demand given that the 2011 elections took place in a much less satisfactory way than the previous elections, to say the very least.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is unfortunate in many respects and especially given that Congolese citizens are truly willing to become more involved in the democratisation of their country. The country is regressing while its citizens want to take part in its recovery.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If things remain as they are, Congo, despite making a promising start in the context of transition, would lag behind considerably when it needs to be injecting a new impetus. Many African countries have already shown that democratisation can work. Therefore, the situation in Congo is not an African inevitability, but rather a refusal or an inability to make the most of the assets that this country has.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is obvious, Baroness Ashton, on 28 November, the Congolese Government was elected on a weak basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for what you have just said, I would like to make three specific proposals for our long-term commitment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first concerns the infamous case of the assassination of Mr Chebeya, a human rights activist. I think this case absolutely needs to be appealed. I think we need to clarify whether or not the police were involved and I believe that the release of Thierry Michel’s film on this matter is a sure-fire way of ensuring this clarification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, Baroness Ashton, freedom of the press. Since 28 November, journalists have been intimidated or arrested on countless occasions. It is very important that this is brought up and discussed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly – something you mentioned – is the insecurity in the East. What is happening is very worrying. Violence continues, the mutiny you talked about, involving Mr Ntaganda, is extremely worrying and has further aggravated the situation. It is also said that Rwandan nationals armed with heavy weapons might be operating in this region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, I will go one step further than you: I think that not only should we say something, we should also question the Rwandan authorities as to whether or not Rwanda is either passively or actively involved in the presence of its nationals armed with heavy weapons when there is an embargo on these weapons in the Congo. I think we must also act here not only because we want peace in the region but, more importantly, to check whether or not the Rwandan authorities are involved. We cannot just stand back and not say anything.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are three things that I suggest you implement fairly quickly, regardless of our long-term commitment to the Congolese people – something I want as well as you – as they waited so long for these elections, and are now left so disappointed and facing so many problems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the elections in the DRC last year did return President Kabila back to power. However, the elections themselves lacked the unequivocal legitimisation of being certified as free and fair, due to incomplete monitoring of the ballot, and there were widespread reports of voter coercion and other irregularities that, as of yet, remain unresolved.</p>
      <p sl="en">I applaud the significant contributions the EU and my own country, the UK, made towards monitoring this exercise in democracy, mindful of the vast size and strategic importance of the DRC. Election observation missions are one area in which the EU can bring real value-added to global democracy. I have participated in them myself in the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kabila should now concentrate on ensuring that his administration is fully transparent and works towards recognised international standards of good governance, fighting widespread corruption, promoting transparency in the extractive industries, upholding the rule of law, protecting human rights for all DRC citizens and, in particular, as mentioned, investigating recurrent stories of atrocities in eastern Congo and bringing those in the irregular militias and armed groups to justice.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the resurgence of violence in, and mass exodus of civilians from, eastern Congo grabbed the attention of the European media last week. The war lord Bosco, who has been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2006, featured prominently in all of this news with his new militia M23.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, it is fortunate that this is only one side of the story in Congo, as I heard yesterday in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Dutch aid organisation ZOA, which has a presence there on the ground. This organisation is optimistic regarding the new Congolese Government’s three stated intentions, which cover an effective reform of the army with a single command, strict state control over the country’s mineral resources and diplomatic initiatives in neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda. The recent successful rise of a more disciplined Congolese army in the east of the country fuels hope for better prospects in the future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Does the High Representative share this hope for restoring peace to the Democratic Republic of Congo? And how is the European Union going to contribute to what is, without doubt, a complex process?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the last elections actually took place within a dramatic context, unworthy of a democracy, even a young democracy, Baroness Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Nedelcheva has told us about the EU’s electoral mission. On the whole, I agree with her analysis and, in particular, her tribute to the Congolese people. Provincial and local elections are due to take place soon, and we should consider the European Union’s assistance in this process. If no lesson has been learnt from the excesses of the regime, the EU cannot continue to offer them its support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say one final word about the symbol that Floribert Chebeya has become. Not only is his killer still on the run, but he is an officer in the Congolese armed forces. Mr Chebeya’s family cannot appeal. Democracy is also about justice, the fight against impunity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if we cannot see elections re-run in the Congo, let us at least strive for better governance. The connection between natural resource dependence, armed conflict and weak governance is all too evident in sub-Saharan Africa and what has been occurring in the post-election environment in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a prime example. The trade patterns in favour of hard commodities, due to the growing demand of China and India, set significant challenges for governance and peace-building for both state and non-state actors alike.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, natural resources do not have to be a curse. When European settlers arrived in North America, this curse was avoided. These settlers found a resource-rich continent, good soil, timber, vast reserves of gold, silver, coal and oil, and subsequently, over two centuries, America grew to become a prosperous region and a world leader.</p>
      <p sl="en">Africa can be the America of the 21st century. It has 60% of the world’s undeveloped arable land, reserves of coal, oil and minerals, as well as large amounts of renewable energy resources. For this reason, and in the interests of good governance, new legislation requiring extractive companies to publish payments to governments on a project-by-project basis is welcome. It is a first step in the right direction. Four hundred million of the world’s poorest people live in sub-Saharan Africa. Effective management of their natural resources and investment in health and education must go hand in hand with strengthened democratic structures and good governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we succeed in changing what has caused the resource curse, then Africans should be able to use these resources – their resources – to build stable, democratic societies. The DRC can be turned around. Good governance will be central to this. That is why good governance must remain a key objective of EU policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Chebeya case rocked the international community as did those of other human rights activists in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a way, it has become a means of measuring the country’s democratic health.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, what has happened since the highly publicised trial in 2011? As Ms Vergiat says, the assassins have a name, a face, but some of them are still walking free. General Numbi has never been prosecuted. The body of Fidèle Bazana, Mr Chebeya’s chauffeur, has never been found.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The appeal by Mr Chebeya’s widow has actually been lodged and, after a year, I have just been told today that a date appears to have finally been set for the consideration of this appeal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The film by the director Thierry Michel, dedicated to the Chebeya case, was released in July in Kinshasa, but the Ministry of Justice sent a letter to the President of the Republic, the Security Service and the Attorney General calling for the film to be banned. We should salute the courage shown by the International Humanist Federation, the Carter Centre in Kinshasa, the Wallonie-Bruxelles Centre and the many parishes and churches that have decided to defy the bans and organise private screenings. I will be going myself in early July.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It has been said that the Congolese elections were flawed. It is now up to the Congolese authorities to prove to us that in spite of these electoral irregularities, the project for a truly democratic Republic of Congo still stands. The Chebeya case shows us there is still a long road ahead.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I have always believed – particularly in view of the experiences of my own country, Poland – that we should help others build a democratic society. I know that determination and hard work are required to achieve this goal, and this includes work in the political sphere. Political leaders, Heads of Government, political organisations and responsible individuals must work together, I repeat, together, to build the future in order to guarantee basic human rights, civil liberties and political, social and economic rights and, most of all, protection for every citizen. I have taken part in a number of observation missions for elections that took place in countries that are on the path to democracy, but what I have read about the present situation in Congo has genuinely shocked me. We are living in the twenty-first century, but reading the words ‘If you resist, we’ll shoot you’ in the Amnesty International report, I had the impression that, in many ways, we are still living in the nineteenth century.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Democratic elections are essential, but this is not enough. The conditions must be put in place for an education and democratisation process, which is a much broader and longer-term process than just the organisation of the elections themselves. It is only if this takes place and only then that it will be possible to hold out any hope – and I do still have hope – that the situation of people in the Republic of Congo, particularly that of civilians and women, might undergo any significant improvement.</p>

What is equally important is whether democratic mechanisms are really working.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to thank Ms Nedelcheva for her involvement in matters relating to the DRC, both during and after the elections. There is no doubt that the Congolese authorities and citizens have much to accomplish. We would therefore ask the Congolese authorities to ratify, as quickly as possible, the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. We also ask for the implementation of all of the recommendations in the final report by the European Union observation mission. We ask the European Commission to make sure that these recommendations help to create a dialogue among all the constituent parts of Congolese society. We also appeal to the Congolese authorities to guarantee freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and freedom of expression, as well as the right to security and physical integrity for all citizens of the Congo. Without these steps, no elections will bring about an improvement in this country’s situation.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Baroness Ashton for her excellent and specific answers. In the final report, however, the EU’s election observers state that the election process in Congo collapsed. It was awash with infringements, fraud, deceit and violence – and then Baroness Ashton’s description of it is that its implementation was not perfect. I think this is an understatement at the very least.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Will we really make any progress with such diplomatic descriptions? Do we not need to be considerably tougher ahead of such events as the forthcoming regional and local elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo? The situation is indeed very serious: conflicts, mass murder, acts of sexual violence towards countless women and abductions are taking place and there is persecution of the political opposition, journalists and human rights activists – and it is rare for anyone to be brought to justice.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Congo has a responsibility of its own, but the EU also has a responsibility for the situation in Congo and its vicinity. We need to be much clearer and much tougher, not only in the long term, but also right now.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have a broad base for our activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Baroness Ashton referred to our two security sector reform missions: EUSEC and EUPOL. Measures like these will enable us to achieve a great deal, if the government also has the political will. In my view, we must continue to provide these missions.</p>

In Tunisia, there was a strong man who very much wanted to remain president and there were also groups which had an interest in the situation staying unchanged.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at the facts that we have gathered and the recommendations based on these facts, which will allow us to make a better job of things next time, and if we, and that includes the EU delegation in the country, see it as our homework to implement them, then we already have enough to do. I would like to see our delegation in Kinshasa and also those in other countries being kept up-to-date at regular intervals on the progress of implementing the recommendations and also making proposals as to what we can do here to encourage our partners in the DRC to do the same. That would be a challenge not only for the DRC but for all the countries where we have had electoral observation missions.</p>

Of course, this should be done before the provincial and local elections, which have, for various reasons, been postponed from the original date of March 2012. In the autumn, I chaired a conference in the European Parliament on the elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Even then, the huge interest and hope for the December elections on the part of the citizens and organisations from the DRC and abroad was palpable, and the high turnout confirmed this interest. People want greater stability, security and prosperity of the country through stronger democracy and transparency and, in this respect, the EU and the Great Lakes region are playing a very important role for it is they who can contribute to the full and more rapid implementation of all the recommendations by means of their significant influence on the authorities and responsible leaders of the DRC. Since the elections in December 2011 were designated by international observers as unreliable and lacking in transparency, I believe that ratification of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance should be the first necessary step.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, it has been said that the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was marked by a lack of transparency and credibility caused by numerous irregularities and fraud. What is worse still is that the DRC is facing a real human tragedy. The security and humanitarian situation continues to worsen. Let us not overlook the fact that over 2 million people have been displaced, 4.5 million people are living in extremely vulnerable conditions and over a million children are suffering from malnutrition in a country so rich in resources.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating Ms Nedelcheva for her report and for her commitment to the problems in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</p>
      <p sl="fr">This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on an extremely interesting issue: the link between elections and democracy on African soil. Cases are, in fact, quite different. On the one hand, first of all, there are countries where the electoral process is in place. The most recent example is in Senegal, where, despite certain fears before the elections, everything went well and a certain democratic stability has been established. On the other hand, there are cases, such as recently in Mali, where the military take control and the electoral process is effectively blocked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Between these two extremes, there are more complicated cases, such as the DRC – and also Guinea – where electoral processes are organised and then, suddenly, postponed or there is post-election violence, a much more difficult and somehow unpredictable road to democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What can we do? I believe it is our responsibility, firstly, to support the monitoring of electoral processes with our missions and, secondly, as Ms Striffler has just said, we obviously need to link electoral support with support for development.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I was also a member of the European Parliament’s electoral observation mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and saw for myself how the people arrived at the polling stations and waited to vote full of hopes and expectations for a better future. We now know that these expectations have not been met. Although the DRC calls itself democratic, these elections were neither fair nor democratic. We must speak out forcefully about this, as Ms Nedelcheva has done in her report.</p>
      <p sl="de">The previous president, Joseph Kabila, claimed that he was the election victor and the opposition was suppressed. In the east of the country, the violent encounters between government troops and so-called rebels have flared up again and it is unclear whether third countries such as Rwanda are involved. In every case, it is the civilian population which suffers and which has not been able to live in peace for decades. The country’s wealth is disappearing in a quagmire of corruption and the DRC comes at or near the bottom of the list in all the international rankings.</p>
      <p sl="de">The international community, and the European Union in particular, must take every opportunity to increase the pressure on the President of the DRC to allow genuine democracy in his country – he will have the chance to do this at the next regional elections – and to prevent the Congolese army from oppressing the civilian population. Instead, criminals who are wanted internationally for crimes against humanity, such as Bosco Ntaganda, must finally be arrested and brought before a court.</p>
      <p sl="de">Countries throughout the world should give an undertaking not to supply any more arms to the DRC. Without external pressure, it will not be possible to bring an end to human suffering and poverty in this country.</p>

      <p sl="es">However, in order to believe in democracy, a people needs to believe in its state and its government, and that will only be possible with electoral support or external aid. They also need there to be a requirement to fight corruption and to bring an end to the obscene paradox of living in poverty in one of the most resource-rich countries in the world. It must be stated, and also condemned, that part of the violence that they are experiencing is imported, or at least fuelled by the unscrupulous multinationals from Europe and other continents that are capable of participating in corruption, not caring whether they are fuelling the battles for those resources, in order to gain favour with those who are running certain areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Baroness Ashton, although it does not fall entirely within your competence, I will say that a greater demand for traceability and transparency from European and other multinationals that operate there would be as useful for the development of this people as the aid that we can provide on an electoral or technical level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have participated in this debate. The fundamental problem in the DRC, as many honourable Members have identified, is governance and, of course, we cannot ignore what happened in the last elections. So we have to build what I would describe as a more contractual relationship with the new government in Kinshasa. That means also that we need stronger political dialogue which will be necessary to guide that cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to keep the humanitarian and security situation in eastern Congo very clearly in mind and to continue to support the dialogue between DRC and Rwanda. The declaration that was made a few days ago is a clear sign that we want to continue to play a constructive role as a regional actor in the Great Lakes. I would also remind honourable Members of the statement that I made on behalf of the EU on 7 June. What I said then was that I was very worried by information that the dynamic between Rwanda and the DRC might be endangered. It is very important that everyone continues their cooperation and makes sure that there is real transparency so that anything that has been done can be investigated.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the possible support of Rwanda to the rebellion, we take very seriously what the United Nations reports have said about support coming from across the border, so it is important to put an end to any or all support mutinies may receive. It is also important that everyone cooperates to investigate this possibility in all aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am absolutely convinced that we have to continue to monitor the human rights situation, including gender-based violence, about which honourable Members have spoken. It has to be a priority for the European Union. That means, too, that we need to see regular political dialogue with the DRC authorities and also with civil society. We have got to continue to strengthen the security sector reform so we can ensure that we strengthen the capacity of the state and that means that we impact on crucial sectors. We have to end impunity, end gender-based violence, end the illegal exploitation of natural resources and support the building of governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate the continued support of the Parliament and pay tribute again to the electoral observation mission, but let me be clear that any future support to elections must depend on the credibility of the process, the implementation of recommendations that have been made by the mission, ownership by the government and a profound reform of the electoral system.</p>

      <p sl="de">The accusations that Rwanda is supplying the rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with trained troops and with arms make the conflict situation in the east of the country even more unclear. In addition, accusations have been made that President Kabila of the DRC has asked for military help from Angola and Zimbabwe. If these prove to be true, the conflict in the east of the DRC could easily turn into a war on a regional scale. All sides seem to have fallen back into their former roles of friends and enemies from the time of the wars in the Congo. As the arms embargoes have repeatedly been broken, the ready availability of weapons constantly reignites the conflicts. The problem is that war is being waged in the DRC in order to gain access to raw materials and the raw materials are being exploited in order for each side to arm itself for war. Past experiences have shown that the UN peacekeepers are not currently in a position to provide adequate protection for the population. It is important for the EU to continue attempting to act as a mediator, but also to follow up the accusations that have been made most recently. We must finally succeed in ensuring that the arms embargoes are complied with and that the civilian population is protected.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our overall strategy in Afghanistan remains to assist the Afghan Government and people to be able to run their own country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ten years after 2001, we have embarked on what the Bonn conference called last December a ‘transformational decade’, sustaining our engagement but changing its nature, and putting Afghans more and more in control.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been some real progress – more than half the country and half the people are already under Afghan security control. But, equally, insurgency remains a major threat to security across the country. I want to extend my personal condolences to the families of the four French soldiers who were killed on Saturday.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many challenges lie ahead. Afghanistan needs, above all, better governance. Without functioning politics and institutions that can be seen to be legitimate and effective, the transition will not succeed. But we also need better action against drugs, better management of public finances, better rule of law and better human rights protection. Continued and increased Afghan leadership will be vital to meeting these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the transition advances, it is right that we look to the government of Afghanistan to set out its own long-term strategy for the country. We are working with the government, Member States and others in the international community to put in place a strategic framework and agreed priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will play our part. Provided the government of Afghanistan meets its obligations, the EU and Member States have committed to enhancing their assistance in Afghanistan for the next ten-year period. We have begun negotiations with the Afghan Government on a new framework – the cooperation agreement for partnership and development – which will provide a legal basis for our cooperation in all civilian fields and assistance to Afghanistan. We expect that assistance from the EU budget will focus on where we can add most value: on health, agriculture, governance and civilian policing.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is crucial that we have confidence that our assistance is being used for the purposes for which it is intended – to improve the lives of ordinary Afghans. That is why we have laid such emphasis on the transparency of public finances. The Arlacchi report – and I pay tribute to Mr Arlacchi, who is here with us this evening – is right to insist that we must, and I quote ‘ensure transparency and accountability in relation to the assistance provided to the Afghan Government, international organisations and NGOs’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have read the allegations of mismanagement of the Law and Order Trust Fund by UNDP with grave concern. I welcome the fact that a full investigation has been announced, and we will await the conclusions of that investigation and take action as appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we are now in the midst of three different conferences that will determine the relationship between the international community and the Afghan Government. Last month, I attended the NATO summit in Chicago, where we set out plans to sustain and develop the Afghan National Security Forces. Both President Barroso and I highlighted the importance that we attach to civilian policing and we announced that we would increase our funding for civilian police by 20% for the period 2011-2013; and also that we intend to make an enhanced contribution post-2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">With both the Afghan Government and international colleagues, I emphasised the critical role that a uniformed police – distinct from the military – needs to play in any democratic society so that people can have confidence in the rule of law and the fair administration of justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our EUPOL training mission provides important support to this role – training police and improving the links between the police and justice. Cooperation with the NATO training mission is working well and, as suggested in the report, we continue to aim for a more complementary division of tasks at both strategic and operational level. We are currently undertaking a strategic review of EUPOL and will reach conclusions on this in the summer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Counter narcotics will remain an important element of our engagement. The problem of drugs cannot be tackled by crop substitution alone. It needs to be addressed in all our programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 14 June, we will have an important conference in Kabul which will focus on increased regional cooperation – advancing the ‘Heart of Asia’ initiative that began in Istanbul last year. That meeting will highlight the important role countries in the region have to play in supporting conflict resolution, better security and development. The European Union has much experience on how to advance regional cooperation and we stand ready to offer that expertise and support to Afghanistan’s neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members will know that I have just returned from Pakistan, where I raised these issues with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and other leaders. I stressed that while we would continue our engagement, Afghanistan’s transition could not succeed without a constructive stance by its neighbours, and we recognised Pakistan’s crucial role in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then, in Tokyo next month, there will be the opportunity for the Afghan Government to set out its development strategy for the country. In Tokyo, the EU will make it clear that our commitment requires a corresponding commitment from the government of Afghanistan to make progress on the issues that matter to us: electoral reform; public finance management; justice and human rights. Above all, we will emphasise that the focus needs to be on results. That means the political will to drive through difficult reforms, and it also means having the necessary security to allow development to take place, especially outside of Kabul.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the recommendations of the report, the EU will press for better coordination of donor support, and a better alignment between the Afghan Government and donors on priorities. We will consider joint programming of EU and Member States’ assistance as circumstances allow.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and Member States are making a real contribution to Afghanistan. The Afghan Government is doing a lot, but it needs to do more to fulfil those key commitments: to hold credible and transparent elections; to improve the management of public finances and to advance human rights, especially the rights of women and children.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to end with a word on the role of women in Afghanistan. I have met with representatives of Afghan women on several occasions – and did so last in the margins of the Bonn conference in December. Their stories and their leadership are remarkable. Afghan women leaders and civil society activists are very concerned that the gains and achievements women have made in the last decade are fragile. This will be a critical issue in any peace talks, but equally we must continue to focus on Afghanistan’s governance and, in particular, the justice institutions: they are key to ensuring that the Afghan Government is able to respond to the commitments it made in London, in Kabul and in Bonn. This is one area where the EU can, and must, play a strong role.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that, in many respects, Afghan women hold the key to the future of their country – and we need to do our utmost to support them as the transition unfolds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, since the introduction of the counter-insurgency strategy in 2009 and the surge in ISAF troops, tactical success has been achieved, where regions like Kandahar and Helmand are secure, by Afghan standards, and the number of police and army soldiers has doubled.</p>
      <p sl="en">A phased transition of security responsibility from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces is on its way and, soon, 75% of Afghanistan’s population will be living in areas where the Afghan forces have taken the lead on security from ISAF, which will be completing its mission gradually by December 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, we encourage an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process of peace and reconciliation for a stable Afghanistan, which breaks ties with international terrorism, and complies with the Afghan Constitution, including its provision of human and women’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The insurgent groups are not the only adversaries of Afghanistan: the narcotics network, the thriving corruption of officials and criminal networks are converging and mutually reinforcing threats. The Afghan police force has to further develop and professionalise. It should evolve towards a credible law enforcement force, for the protection of the civilian population and the system of the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and NATO commitment to the stability and development of Afghanistan, but also to its security, goes beyond 2014, with perhaps a shift from combat mission to new training, advising and enhanced assistance along the lines you have just described, Madam High Representative.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I listened carefully to Ms Ashton’s statement and I am not happy about what she said.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Ashton, you spoke on the report on Afghanistan by this Parliament as if it was released a couple of weeks ago. We are talking about a report which was approved by this Parliament in December 2010, so I would have preferred to have heard from you something about the implementation of the report in the past year and a half.</p>
      <p sl="en">You spoke a great deal about things to be done in Afghanistan. Some of them are absolutely reasonable and right, but you did not mention two major issues that were contained in my report: firstly, the issue of the peace process. What to do with the peace process in Afghanistan is the crucial political point for the future of the country, particularly now that the military occupation is ending.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point was the narcotics issue: the only reference you made to that was that crop substitution alone cannot solve the drug problem. Of course; but no one would dissent in any way from this statement. The report contained a very detailed call for a five-year plan to eliminate opium production in Afghanistan through alternative development. This plan has never been carried out in Afghanistan; it was urgent two years ago and it is more urgent now that opium production is still continuing to increase.</p>
      <p sl="en">We developed also a relationship with the Russian Federation – along with Europe, the major victim of Afghan opium. We had here the internal contacts responsible for the Russian Federation and we developed ideas and plans. Russia was also ready to fund, to co-fund with the EU, a plan to eliminate opium production. Nothing happened; we never had from your office any answer to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are the reasons I am not happy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am happy with Ms Ashton’s discourse. I am not happy with Afghanistan’s future.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to the Lisbon Summit, the ISAF mission will be finished in 2014. We are now analysing 10 years of partnership between the international community and Afghanistan. What has happened in these ten years? We can all report some achievement in economics, in freedom, in human rights, in women’s rights, in health care, but are these achievements enough to consider Afghanistan a stable and democratic country?</p>
      <p sl="de">Is Afghanistan today a country which certainly has a democratic future? If I look to the NATO summit, I see a lot of optimism. I believe that we must look behind this optimistic approach, and behind this optimistic approach we will see still increased drug production in Afghanistan, increased corruption and widespread unemployment in that country.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am really sure that women can play an active role in democratisation, but for how long will women be allowed to play this role after the withdrawal of the ISAF mission?</p>
      <p sl="de">I am afraid that our strategy for a future Afghanistan is not a realistic one and it is going to be really difficult to implement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Certainly, we need a strong partnership, not only between the European Union and Afghanistan, but I believe also between the United States and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, coming back to the NATO summit, I can see one chair left empty. It is Putin’s. Maybe Russia can start to play an active role in the area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, if the NATO summit officially records a decision to pull out of Afghanistan, it might as well be officially recording the defeat of the West.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we were to compare the statements made by NATO and the Council with information coming from Afghan civil society and the NGOs, you would think that they were talking about two different countries: the resurgence of the Taliban, who are champing at the bit to stamp their authority on the entire country and take their revenge on those who collaborated with the West. I refer of course to women, and I remember how, in 2001, the plight of Afghan women was exploited to justify a military intervention that the population had not asked for.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After the bombings and destruction, they were promised reconstruction, peace and democracy. They have failed. According to the Minister, Mr Eftekhari, 6 million children are suffering from extreme poverty, abuse and violence. Under pressure from the Taliban, schools have been burned, teachers threatened and killed. Nearly 550 girls’ schools have closed their doors in 11 provinces. Young people flee the country to come to the West, the land of promise. There is no point dwelling on the reception or rather the lack of reception waiting for them in Europe: we should be ashamed of ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, Pakistan and Iran have decided to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from their countries. Given the EU’s commitment to the Afghan people, are we prepared, Baroness Ashton, at Council level and in the European External Action Service (EEAS), to adopt a plan to help and take in these refugees? Will we welcome and support the threatened teachers, the women’s rights activists, all those who have put their trust in us and who have to choose …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, if the European Union has ambitions to become a global player, it must pay particular attention when creating its common foreign policy to the regions that can be described as black holes in the geopolitical map of the world. Afghanistan belongs in this category. This is a country that has been devastated by long-standing wars and is associated primarily with terrorism, the drugs trade (a subject discussed by Baroness Ashton), the arms trade and human trafficking. Led by the desire to bring about positive change resulting in democracy and the creation of a civil society, the European Commission and Member States send enormous sums of money to Afghanistan, and I would be very glad if Baroness Ashton could tell us how much the European Union spends on this goal each year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The problems in Afghanistan may appear to be many thousands of kilometres away from the borders of the European Union, but, living in our global village, we are directly impacted by the consequences of the crisis in that country, the flow of illegal immigrants being just one symptom. In continuing its efforts to stabilise the situation, the European Union should make better use of the experience of certain Member States, such as Poland for example, which have a good understanding of the stabilisation process in this region and have long been involved in it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Afghanistan is a war that has been lost by the West. After over a decade of our involvement, it has not been possible to defeat the partisans or to gain the support of the civilian population. The main pillar of our activities was intended to be security and victory in the fight against the rebel forces. Despite the consensus between Europe and the United States, as well as support from Russia, it has not been possible to cut Taliban forces off from their bases in Pakistan and Peshawar. It has not been possible to stabilise the internal situation. In practice, acting together with the Afghans, we control only part of the country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What can we do in this tragic situation? At a time when the President of France is talking about the early withdrawal of forces and the United States has no plan at all, we should concentrate our efforts on the fight against sources of funding for the terrorists so that, deprived of funds, they no longer represent an alternative to the government in Kabul. The European Union should increase funding to encourage Afghan farmers to stop cultivating poppies. In addition, funds allocated for development should be disbursed centrally for regional projects. There is a particular need for infrastructure in the fields of water and agriculture. We should remember that a continued break-up of Afghanistan could result in the Somalisation of the country and its division into warring tribes.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank Baroness Ashton once again. I agree with those who have said that we are faced with a failure. That must be acknowledged. Above and beyond NATO’s image campaigns, which is what they are, what is clearly true is that with regard to 2015, we do not know where the peace process will be, in other words, whether the Taliban will have more or less control of Afghanistan by then, if there will be more or less peace, or if there will be more or less corruption. We do not know anything about the plan to provide an alternative for all the opium drug crops; there is nothing, no information. Neither do we know what the withdrawal plan is, as it seems that Pakistan is refusing to negotiate this possibility. We therefore have a scenario in which, above and beyond propaganda, the only concern and the only data that we are being given is that the armed police force is 53% larger than planned. We know nothing more, however.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the military presence of allied forces is coming to an end, and I think that is right, because it is time for the Afghan people and the Afghan leaders to run their own country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Afghans should have ownership of their country, but, of course, we should not repeat the mistake made after the end of Soviet intervention to leave Afghanistan and to leave the Afghan people to their own destiny. We should be helping: we should be helping with international aid; we should be helping with the training of the police and continuing to help the Afghans prepare to run their country. We should also have an alternative strategy as far as the economy is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">We talk a lot about the narcotics trade, but have we developed an alternative over the last 10 years? Afghanistan is potentially not a poor country: Afghanistan is a country rich in mineral resources, in natural resources. So, for instance, I would like to see more involvement on the part of our countries, of the Member States, with regard to exploiting Afghanistan’s natural resources. If the Chinese can be involved there, then why not us?</p>
      <p sl="en">On combating narcotics trafficking, we should cooperate with our allies and with Afghanistan’s neighbours. The Arlacchi report mentioned Russia. I do not think we did enough where cooperation with Russia was concerned. I would also propose that we cooperate more intensively than we do now with Iran, because the Iranian police forces and young people in Iran are paying a very heavy price for the narcotics trade. Through this approach, we could also develop in a closer, more confident way with Iran.</p>
      <p sl="en">In other words, our presence is over, but we should not just leave Afghanistan to its own destiny; we should be helping.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this item is entitled ‘A new strategy for Afghanistan’. However, what you, Baroness Ashton, have presented here today is not new at all. The fact is that the West has had another historic failure in Afghanistan. Also, we do not know whether Mr Karzai or his successor will survive or be able to keep the Taliban under control.</p>
      <p sl="de">What has the whole International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission cost and what has it achieved? There is just the same amount of terrorism, the Taliban are still out of control and drug cultivation is increasing. Thousands of people have died and this is referred to as collateral damage. The very people who, in an earlier debate, complained strongly about the fact that people are dying in Syria are trivialising the deaths in Afghanistan by calling them collateral damage. This is pure cynicism. We must learn once again to give more respect to the cultural and political sovereignty of other peoples, as a basis for the cooperation called for by the previous speaker. We will not be able to impose our system on other countries as we did in colonial times. We will have to learn humility again. The situation in Afghanistan makes it clear how quickly we will have to do this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to start by saying that for the first time, I am very happy that there is someone missing from the Chamber, as I will speak faster than planned, since the match between Poland and Russia kicks off in 25 minutes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Moving on to Afghanistan, however, we should not already be talking about a military operation, although I would like to make just one comment: the Polish Government, in the words of the President or Minister Sikorski, has said that we went into Afghanistan together and we should come out together. I would like to add one comment about other countries: it is a shame that the politics of the day and the fight for votes determine the decisions of those in power, as the consequence of this is that we shall not come out of Afghanistan together, since there are those who will leave earlier.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of course, the situation continues to be very uncertain and there are many concerns about the future of Afghanistan. At present, we have two years to prepare Afghanistan for an independent government and for the country to function independently. In this context, what the High Representative said on this subject is obviously very important: training, consultancy, those soft measures which, in the future, will enable Afghanistan to function normally. I think that we must help to find a way for this country to function and to find out how it should develop economically, what it should produce and what it should export abroad. These are very important matters. However, the development aid that we provide must be sensible and thought through, without wasting money.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Lady Ashton, when the NATO forces leave Afghanistan in 2014, will the country be able to take its future into its own hands in a peaceful way? As things stand, that does not seem likely. First of all, Mr Karzai’s government is weak, it is embroiled in corruption controversies, it is internally divided and it is split over the importance of reconciliation. Secondly, the Afghan army is still not able to take over the role of the NATO troops and, thirdly, there is still very little in the way of Afghan leadership in the negotiations between the parties and in the region. They are being dominated by Washington, with its own American agenda, and that will not lead to a successful outcome.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This conflict will not end without a negotiated political agreement, but Mr Karzai’s government is unlikely to be in a position to contribute to that. The International Crisis Group made a good suggestion: let the UN team of mediators, accepted by all parties, provide a realistic new start to the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am curious as to how Lady Ashton will respond to this proposal. Perhaps, the EU could insist on this. The EU’s role must be political, about more than material assistance, more than simply the training of police officers, and also more than the financial assistance that we must continue to provide. Whatever happens, the EU should continue to support the strengthening of Afghan democracy, Afghan institutions, the electoral system, decentralisation of power, the consolidation of local parties and local authorities. This, together with the fight against corruption, is essential for a credible, viable administration after 2014.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, almost 10 years since the start of military action in Afghanistan and it is clear that the situation on the ground is still particularly uncertain. The efforts of the international community have failed to put an end to the Taliban insurgency, and peace and stability in Afghanistan have still not been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">France has recently lost four soldiers – yet another four soldiers – in a suicide attack in Kapisa province. This strategy highlights the fact that there is no obvious end in sight in Afghanistan. I worry about an early withdrawal of combat troops by the end of 2012, as it is both tactically difficult and considered unfair by our allies. However, I would like to congratulate the European soldiers who have done a great job in training the Afghan army.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In December 2010, Parliament adopted a very clear report on the strategy to be adopted in Afghanistan focusing on four priority areas for action, in particular, training the police, coordinating international aid and the elimination of opium poppy cultivation. This is an angle of attack that I fully support, but I would warn the international community against an early exit from Afghanistan.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we Members of the European Parliament voted in favour of a new EU strategy for Afghanistan back in 2010, when it was observed that only about 20% of EU aid reaches the people who need it. We asked, for example, for a reform of international aid, for the destruction of poppy seed plantations, and for the Afghan police to receive better training.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU’s External Action Service’s country strategy expires in 2013, and we have not, as part of the international community, been able to help Afghanistan in the way that we wanted to. It would seem that the country is still in a desperate state, and this has only become worse as a result of the Taliban’s spring offensive.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Foreign Affairs Council in May reminded us that Afghanistan is to hold elections in 2014 and 2015. However, the country is not ready for elections, and the EU must ensure that Mr Karzai’s government undertakes to reform its electoral system before May 2013. The EU would be a good partner in implementing these reforms and in strengthening independent institutions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, what Baroness Ashton has said is certainly heading in the right direction as, in my opinion, it is sensible to change the policy followed by the European Union, and more broadly speaking by the West, from a policy of replacing the Afghan authorities to a policy of helping these authorities take responsibility for the security and development of their own country. In this regard, I would like to draw attention to an opportunity that we in the European Union have been failing to exploit sufficiently. I believe that the European Union should launch a special programme of scholarships for young Afghans. I am thinking here, in particular, about training specialists in such areas as medicine, land reclamation or geology. I believe this would yield better results.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in May, President Barroso bragged of the EU and its Member States throwing EUR 1.2 billion a year down the Afghan drain. But EUR 1.2 billion is only a fraction of the true cost. Britain’s contribution alone to the Afghan farce, according to the British Ministry of Defence, is already over GBP 18 billion, plus GBP 3 billion in aid, plus GBP 4 billion in equipment that is to be left behind, plus GBP 5 billion that will be screwed out of the British taxpayer to run Afghanistan for a further 30 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, 417 British dead are the highest price of all and the most obscene, because it is a war that has nothing to do with Britain. We should bring our troops home at once and put the neo-con crooks who sent them there on trial as war criminals.</p>

    <intervention id="2-526-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Catherine Ashton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me begin by saying that those in this House who believe that we need to commit to Afghanistan will recognise that this is a long-term commitment and that the stability and security not just of the region, but way beyond the region, are partly dependent on the success that Afghanistan can achieve and the way that its people can be supported into a better future.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt, too, that this is a commitment that is difficult at times. It requires us to continue to push hard on ensuring that what we believe should be done by the Afghan Government is indeed done, and that we ensure that our resources are well spent.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union spends EUR 200 million a year in Afghanistan on a range of different programmes to try and support stability, economic growth, the role of women, health care, rural development – a whole range of different projects – and especially to support the building of a civilian police force, so essential to the state’s future, when justice and the rule of law can be not only talked about but can be seen to be effective across the country. In addition, EUR 1 billion are spent by Member States across the European Union to try and support these efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are good news stories. Unfortunately, it is very difficult sometimes to understand the positive side of what is happening in Afghanistan, but we have seen health care improve, infant mortality going down, and very many girls in school and finally getting the education they deserve. Access to health care at a primary level, which used to be less than 10%, is now more than 60%. These are important, alongside many of the other ways in which we can try and support this country into the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sorry that Mr Arlacchi feels disappointed in this. I know that you met with our chief operating officer a few weeks ago, and I hope that was a useful meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will just comment on a couple of issues I know are of particular importance to you. We are supportive of the Afghan-led peace process and reconciliation but we talked again in Bonn about the ‘red lines’ that have been restated. We have to be clear that we need respect for the Afghan constitution, including its human rights provisions; I believe that is indispensable. I believe you agree with me on that, because only then will this process be truly inclusive, representing the legitimate interests of all the people of Afghanistan, regardless of gender, regardless of social status. We said in Bonn that we must see the region respect and support the peace process and its outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the Istanbul process is under way and, in a few days, the ministerial regional conference in Kabul should hopefully provide some real concrete evidence of the growing understanding by Afghanistan’s neighbours that they have got a lot to gain from a sovereign, stable and united Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know, too, that the proposals on eradication of opium cultivation were to set aside EUR 100 million and to create an agency with its own budget and staff. But we have chosen to try and back the structures that we have actually got in place on the ground, to try and work with the Ministry of Counter Narcotics, the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of the Interior, because, in truth, trying to eradicate the cultivation of drugs is about a whole raft of programmes. It means rural development, it means health, it means law enforcement and it means border management.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we also know, of course, is that the areas where you have greater persistence in opium poppy production are those that have neither security nor governance, so not areas where we are able to operate, nor indeed would we be able to pursue the policy in the way that I know you would wish to see.</p>
      <p sl="en">The commitment, though, is there. We have got to try and find ways to tackle the real issues that stand in the way of Afghanistan going forward. But we have to recognise that this is a long-term commitment and a commitment that moves us beyond 2014 into the work we need to do on development. If we do not, I believe the consequences will be enormous, not just for the people of Afghanistan, but actually for us too.</p>

      <p sl="ro">NATO has confirmed in Chicago that ISAF military operations in Afghanistan will end in 2014 after a gradual transfer of responsibility to the Afghan authorities. I wish to emphasise again, as I have also done in my previous speeches on this subject, that the Afghan Government’s full involvement is required to ensure long-term stability. At the same time, international support must also continue after 2014, especially through the training and assistance programmes. I believe that the EU can also make a valuable contribution to this process. This is why I welcome the decisions made by the Council in May on supporting the efforts to achieve stability in Afghanistan, and I hope that they will be implemented as soon as possible. With this aim in mind, I suggest looking into the possibility of structured cooperation between EUPOL and other training missions. I also call for specific attention to be focused on the programmes for improving the situation of women as part of development assistance. I should mention that my country has already confirmed that it will maintain its commitment to Afghanistan until the end of the ISAF mission, being due to provide security in the Zabul region. Last but not least, I acknowledge the courage and devotion of Romania’s soldiers who are contributing, sometimes paying with their lives, to establishing security, stability and democracy in Afghanistan.</p>

      <p sl="ro">After 11 years of effort by the international community, the current situation in Afghanistan still requires considerable improvements. Violent extremism, prevalent both inside and outside the region, the problem of drugs grown and produced in Afghanistan, as well as socio-economic indicators, highlight the need for the EU to play a much more active role in the reconstruction and development of the region. The EU’s efforts must focus on improving the operation of the Afghan Government’s structures. The strategy for Afghanistan must emphasise the significant involvement of Afghan institutions and citizens in developing their country with the aim of achieving stable governance supported by the international community. It must focus all its efforts on socio-economic development. The European Union is one of the biggest partners taking part in the reconstruction of Afghanistan through the logistical aid and equipment it provides. I wish to point out that the way in which the aid reaches Afghanistan and is distributed needs to be readjusted. I believe that a larger proportion of the aid needs to be channelled directly via Afghan institutions, which is a better solution than distributing it via the international cooperation and development agencies. The Afghan Government’s legitimacy stands to grow if it is going to take responsibility for delivering aid.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, defence and promotion of human rights around the world is a key component of the EU’s foreign policy. In this context, we follow closely the human rights situation in Tibet. We consider that our human rights dialogue with China is an essential part of the EU-China relationship and, in this context, we are committed to engage with China to improve the situation on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is concerned by the deterioration of the situation in Tibet, illustrated by the wave of self-immolations and by clashes between police and local people since the beginning of the year. In recent days, we have been particularly concerned by the news of mass arrests and detentions taking place in the Tibetan Autonomous Region following self-immolations in Lhasa, as well as reports that the area has been closed to foreigners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, some 37 self-immolations of Tibetans have occurred in China since 2011. These have been concentrated in Sichuan province but have also taken place in other Tibetan-populated areas where increasing restrictions on religious activities seem to have given rise to a surge of frustration and protest among Tibetans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last three years, an increasing number of Tibetan intellectuals and cultural figures have faced criminal charges or been imprisoned. We are worried by restrictions on the expression of Tibetan identity and freedom of expression in Tibet. The EU has taken note that the five-year plans adopted by the Chinese authorities in January and March 2011 include an expansion of hydropower, railways, mining and tourism across the Tibetan plateau. We welcome China’s wish to raise the living standards of the Tibetan population. However, there are reports of growing discontent among Tibetans regarding local development policies, and of protests against mining and hydro-electric projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU supports the Chinese authorities and their wish to better protect the environment in China, but nevertheless, we are most concerned about the impact of the policy of resettlement of Tibetan nomads. Tibetan culture and traditional lifestyles are based on a nomadic way of life. While taking note of the Chinese authority’s commitment that the resettlement of nomads is intended to preserve the Tibetan grasslands, we do question whether the objective of environmental protection can only be reached by eliminating the traditional way of life of Tibetans who have lived for centuries in harmony with nature. We are concerned that the compulsory resettlement of all nomads has the potential to destroy the distinctive Tibetan culture and identity.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also worried by the impact of the policy to make Mandarin Chinese the primary language of instruction in Tibetan schools, as in schools in other minority-populated areas. Several hundred students protested against the reform of the education system that seeks to promote education in Chinese rather than in Tibetan in Qinghai province.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also concerned about the intensification of restrictions on religious activities in Tibet, including quotas of monks and nuns who may reside at a monastery and measures limiting their travel between different areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, we raised all these issues at the EU-China human rights dialogue on 29 May 2012. We call upon the Chinese authorities to ensure that the human rights of the Tibetan people are respected, including their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, as well as the right to enjoy their own culture, to practise their own religion and to use their own language.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also urge the Chinese authorities to exercise restraint and to allow access by foreign diplomats and journalists to all Tibetan autonomous areas. Following the last meeting between the Chinese authorities and the envoys of the Dalai Lama in early 2010, the EU strongly supports the restart of the dialogue between all parties in order to contribute to a durable solution. We believe this dialogue can contribute to the improvement of the human rights situation of the Tibetan people.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are sending out a number of different signals by holding this debate on human rights. We will not accept violations of human dignity, injustice or the persecution of minorities. This includes the situation in Tibet. Baroness Ashton, as High Representative of the Union, you have raised the issue of the events at the Kirti monastery, including the siege, the abduction of people to unknown destinations and the torture, as part of the dialogue between the EU and China. You have rightly called for explanations. The answer given by the Chinese authorities was succinct. The monks themselves were responsible for the social unrest.</p>
      <p sl="de">There has been no let-up in the brutal suppression of Tibetan culture, spirituality, language and fundamental chances of survival. This is why dozens of nuns and monks have immolated themselves as a symbol of protest but also of powerlessness. These desperate calls for help must not go unheard. On behalf of the Tibet Intergroup in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the vast majority of the representatives of the European people, I would like to repeat the call that we have been making for years. Appoint a special representative for Tibet based on the model of the US Department of State or put in place a future coordinator for human rights, a person who will provide Tibet with visible public support and coordinate the measures taken by the Commission and the Council. As there are still no noticeable improvements in the living conditions in Tibet, Baroness Ashton, you must ensure that the subject of Tibet appears on the agenda of every meeting with the representatives of the People’s Republic of China. The Tibetans, who have been subjected to immense suffering for decades, need this sign of hope and European solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, China embodies much more than a country, more than the Communist state and more than the current wild and corrupt capitalist economy. It is an extraordinary civilisation and a people whom I greatly admire. China also has particular responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, among them to respect human rights and to ensure they are respected, which is a particular pillar of the United Nations Charter.</p>
      <p sl="en">I cannot accept that any allegations of constraints, of whatever kind, exercised in Tibetan monasteries and in Tibetan life can be any excuse to justify China’s violation of the human rights of the Tibetans in Tibet and elsewhere. I believe that the Tibetans have the right to enjoy their own culture, identity and freedom. They should be entitled to freedom of religion, to practise their religion and to practise freedom of expression and assembly. I cannot accept China closing Tibet to foreign visitors, including foreign diplomats and journalists. What is there to hide? I cannot accept that the Panchen Lama child has disappeared for decades and that China does not account for the people that have self-immolated in the last months and the mass arrests and detentions that go on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe the current authorities in China are making a big mistake in continuing to refuse to negotiate with the Dalai Lama. It is a self-defeat for China. This will actually prepare the way for a more extremist, hard-line leadership in the future. This is the reason why I will vote for this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the ALDE Group has drawn attention to the human rights situation in Tibet on several occasions, yet we have failed to see much progress being made. We appreciate that the EU has raised the Tibetan issues in the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, but clearly further steps are needed to move on from formal rhetoric to genuine dialogue and commitment.</p>
      <p sl="de">The policies of the People’s Republic of China have become increasingly repressive after the protests of 2008. There is an ongoing human rights crisis in Tibet, which manifests itself in arrests, torture and political imprisonment; restricted freedom of expression, association and belief, as well as in the marginalisation of Tibetan identity, language and culture. Such repressive policies have provoked the reported self-immolation of 38 Tibetans since 2009. The gravity of the situation calls for greater involvement of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">We therefore strongly urge the soon-to-be-appointed European Union Special Representative for Human Rights to ensure that the EU spotlight remains on Tibet by reporting regularly on this issue. However, in order to reflect the gravity of the Tibetan issue and worsening repression, we strongly believe that the High Representative must also appoint a special coordinator for Tibet responsible for advancing the human rights of the Tibetan people and encouraging constructive dialogue between the PRC and the Tibetan Government-in-exile.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has been repeatedly stressed that human rights are an integral part of EU external policies, which is all the more reason for taking an exemplary position in our relations with China, as human rights have remained the main obstacle so far.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, as you have explained, the situation in Tibet is not only very bad, but is also continuing to deteriorate. We should all see this as an alarm signal. The response of the Chinese leadership to the desperate acts of self-immolation has been even greater repression.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tibet has once again been closed to the press, to free reporting and to tourists. The Sino-Tibetan talks have been put on hold. The autonomy which Tibet enjoys according to the Chinese constitution exists only on paper and has not been implemented. The Chinese leadership reacts aggressively to all forms of criticism of this situation from the representatives of the European Union. I would like to highlight the fact that the forced resettlement of nomads is not only damaging to Tibetan culture, but is also a problem for the environment in the Tibetan highlands.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want this policy to change. We want genuine autonomy for Tibet within the Chinese constitution, real rights to education, tradition and religion and an end to marginalisation.

We have taken the opportunity to raise these issues at all of the high-level political meetings we have with our Chinese counterparts, as well as making several démarches to express our anxiety not only about the situation in Tibet, but also about individual cases of concern.

      <p sl="hu">Since November 2010, we have already adopted three resolutions on Tibet here in the European Parliament. The fact that today, the case is once again on the agenda is an indication of the severity of the situation. Since 2009 already, 35 Tibetan monks have set themselves on fire in a final act of desperation. The Chinese authorities are restricting the Tibetan people’s exercise of their cultural and religious rights and their access to education in their native language, are manipulating the ethnic proportions of the Tibetan population through settlement, and are forcing Tibet to abandon the ancient lifestyle of the indigenous population. This situation is unacceptable! All international bodies need to pay increased attention. The issue of Tibet may be an ever-present topic in the EU’s dialogues with China, but it is not enough to discuss the matter – concrete progress is needed. An effective and tangible arrangement must be secured to protect the rights of the Tibetan people, even by putting pressure on China, if necessary. I hope that through the new Special Representative for Human Rights to be elected soon, the EU will be able to take more effective action in this respect. As the Dalai Lama himself said at our solemn plenary session in Brussels in 2008: the Tibetan people are seeking autonomy for Tibet rather than complete independence, and renounce a violent solution. We must therefore give the Tibetan community all our support in their peaceful freedom fight for self-determination.</p>

      <p sl="pl">When considering the present situation in Tibet, we should start by noting that, year after year, Freedom House cites Tibet as the worst place in terms of respect for freedom and human rights. Following the bloody uprising against China on 10 March 1959, when the Dalai Lama and 80 000 Tibetans fled to India, the situation in this country has been very serious. There is a palpable atmosphere of fear. Innocent people are still being tortured and imprisoned and denied most of the rights that are guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Chinese Government has banned all signs of support for the Dalai Lama. We should also remember the terrible events occurring in Tibet since March 2011, when a monk set himself alight as a protest against Chinese occupation. Since then, about 40 people have self-immolated in protest at the policies conducted by the Chinese authorities in respect of Tibetans, and most of them have died.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be emphasised that human right defenders describe these suicides as a desperate attempt to respond to Beijing’s cultural and religious repression and the growing Han domination. However, the Chinese Interior Ministry blames this situation on the Dalai Lama, saying that he is encouraging terrorists to engage in separatist activities. The Dalai Lama himself is opposed to any kind of violence in the struggle for Tibetan freedom, rights and national dignity. In view of this troubling situation in Tibet, we should immediately start acting to negotiate agreements for the future of Tibet. The people living in this area need both political and financial assistance but, first of all, steps need to be taken to promote human rights and religious freedom.</p>
