      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the debate on the report by Satu Hassi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur content of marine fuels (COM(2011)0439 - C7-0199/2011 - 2011/0190(COD)) (A7-0038/2012).</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my deepest gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs, and also to the Commission, for their excellent levels of cooperation during the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With cooperation from Parliament’s negotiating team, we managed to improve the directive considerably from the perspective of both human health and easing the cost burden for industry. The directive brings into effect the new sulphur limits for ships agreed four years ago by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), and they are to be made part of EU legislation. Pollutant emissions from ships will decrease substantially: ships must either switch to low sulphur fuels or clean their flue gases. In the emission restriction areas, that is to say, the Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel, a 0.1% sulphur limit will take effect at the beginning of 2015, and in other European seas, a 0.5% sulphur limit will be introduced in 2020.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This might be the most significant health reform introduced during the entire parliamentary term. The air pollution currently caused by ships is thought to be responsible for around 50 000 premature deaths a year. If marine sulphur emissions are reduced to almost a tenth, thousands of lives will be saved every year.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although the main content of the directive is about streamlining EU legislation so that it more closely reflects the international agreement on the environment, it is an example of lobbying that focuses sharply on the issue. I would now like to correct what appears to be a common misconception. The new sulphur limit in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel will become law even if the EU directive is not enacted. The decision taken four years ago by the IMO is international law, and will be in force even without the directive. Most of the Member States of the EU and the other IMO Member States have already ratified it. For example, after 2015, a Finnish ship would no longer be able to enter legally the ports of other European countries, nor even those in virtually any other country.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I have the following questions for those of you who have called for the EU to oppose international environmental norms for shipping. Do you want half of all countries – including Russia, for example – to dissociate themselves from the double hull requirement for oil tankers? That would incur costs too. Or do you want tens of thousands of people to die prematurely from marine pollution? Do you want European taxpayers to pay for the costs of heart and lung disease, which is many times what cleaning up marine pollution would cost?</p>
      <p sl="fi">The directive is needed to coordinate the implementation of the IMO’s decision with monitoring in Europe. In addition, it will provide a level playing field for Europe and soften the impact on industry. The negotiated text means that Section 86 of the guidelines on State aid for environmental protection, the section on retrofitting environmental protection, needs to be applied. In this case, far more State aid than normal can be granted for the installation of flue gas scrubbers up to the end of 2014.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The directive will also level the playing field between northern and southern Europe, when they, too, switch to low sulphur marine fuels in southern Europe in 2020, even if the IMO grants a five-year grace period to seas outside the emission restriction areas.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask those of you who intend to vote against the directive this question. Do you want to deprive industry in northern Europe of this safety net that the directive has agreed on, and do you also want to deprive Europe of the improved standards of equality within it, which the directive incorporates?</p>

    <intervention id="2-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Satu Hassi, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Transport for the excellent work carried out on this proposal. We have been waiting for it for a number of years. It was already clear in 2005 that, with business as usual, sulphur emissions from shipping would exceed those from all land-based sources in the European Union by 2020. In order to reverse this trend, the Commission supported the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in developing internationally binding standards for the quality of marine fuels, which were agreed in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was a major breakthrough. The new standards will bring very significant health and environmental benefits and will contribute to resolving problems faced by Member States in complying with air quality limits.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although they are highly cost-effective for the economy as a whole, the Commission is aware of the potential economic impact on the shipping industry. That is why we have brought forward a set of measures to support compliance with the legislation in a staff working paper entitled the Sustainable Waterborne Transport Toolbox. This work has now culminated in the proposal on which you will vote today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is satisfied with the compromise text, which aligns the directive with the international rules of Annex 6 of the MARPOL Convention in respect of sulphur standards and strengthens provisions on enforcement and monitoring.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me explain some of the very good reasons which have already been explained by Ms Hassi.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the stricter sulphur standards agreed at the IMO will now be introduced into European Union legislation and, hence, will benefit from the European Union enforcement regime. The European Union legislation will introduce the global 0.5% sulphur standard in 2020, while the IMO foresees a review clause with a possibility to postpone it till 2025. We support the choice made by the colegislators as it brings certainty for investors and operators, as well as fairness across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the directive will allow the use of emissions abatement technologies, such as scrubbers, or LNG as alternatives to the use of low sulphur fuels. These alternative compliance methods allow operators to choose the most cost-efficient compliance option and also promote development of clean technologies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the provisions on enforcement of the standards and guidelines on monitoring and reporting of fuel used by ships should result in a more effective control of compliance with the new standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that this directive will contribute significantly to reducing air pollution and thus will have a positive impact on people’s health. It is also a step towards a more modern and greener shipping industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, a number of changes introduced in the Commission’s proposal during the first reading deliberations require the Commission to make six declarations concerning: the revision of Directive 2000/55/EC on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues; the use of the ‘non-opinion’ clause for the adoption of implementing acts; the use of dynamic reference to the IMO on the establishment of new Sulphur Emission Control Areas; the use of implementing acts instead of delegated acts for sampling and reporting of marine fuels; the request to the Commission to develop new measures supporting the implementation of the directive by the end of 2012; and finally, the ongoing work to review the EU thematic strategy on air pollution to assess the costs and benefits of additional measures to reduce air pollution from shipping, including the impact of applying a maximum fuel sulphur standard of 0.1% in territorial waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will, of course, pass the full text of these declarations to the plenary services to be recorded in the minutes. The Commission firmly believes that the outcome of the codecision process is a good step forward and it accepts the compromise reached at first reading. So, once again, congratulations on the very good work. It was not an easy compromise but it was very well done.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, the sulphur content of marine fuels undoubtedly has a significant effect not just on the European environment and on air quality, but also on the transport sector. According to various estimates, the secondary particulates produced by sulphur and nitrogen oxides arising from air pollution from ships cause up to 50 000 premature deaths in Europe every year.</p>
      <p sl="et">Given the above, and in view of the agreement that is on the table today, it must be said that the objectives that were set have largely not been achieved. We need to set equal rates that apply to all of Europe’s seas, in order to guarantee clean air not only for Northern Europeans, but also for other coastal areas of Europe. It is also important to guarantee fair and equal competition in the transport sector, and to avoid the unequal treatment of shipping companies operating in different regions.</p>
      <p sl="et">The European Commission and the Member States should follow the example of the United States and Canada, which jointly established a sulphur monitoring area within 200 nautical miles of their entire coastlines, and they should set firm deadlines for establishing a pollution monitoring area covering the whole of Europe. Although I take a critical view of the agreement concluded between the Council and Parliament, I support the adoption of this report, because the indecision that has existed since 2008 must be brought to an end, and a clear signal must be given about the future. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Satu Hassi, and our other colleagues.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is with mixed feelings that I stand here today, as the decision that we are to vote on, that is to say, the implementation of the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) agreement on sulphur, is something that we have had very little opportunity to influence. I think it is far from a brilliant piece of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I welcome the fact that we are finally tackling the issue of sulphur and that we have a global solution, as it is a major health problem. As the Commissioner pointed out, sulphur emissions from shipping will soon exceed sulphur emissions on land.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Anyone who has seen bunker oil will know what I mean. Bunker oil is so dirty that in many cases, it has to be heated up just to get it into the engine to burn it. However, as I said, the way in which this decision was taken is not at all good. In fact, it is completely unreasonable. The agreement splits Europe in two. It gives the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel, in other words, the areas that already have the strictest rules in the world, even stricter rules, while, at the same time, nowhere near as much is done in other parts of Europe. It is as though the lives of Greek people are worth less than those of Danish people, for example.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At Parliament’s reading of the matter, we tried to rectify this absurdity and ensure that we have stricter requirements everywhere at the same time. We managed to make a slight improvement, but it is a long way from being enough. This decision results in unequal conditions throughout Europe. This will be extremely expensive, costing in the order of many billions, which will be noticeable in the already stretched state budgets. Even yesterday, I saw that industries were announcing that they would move, in which case we have gained nothing.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the Member States have asked for this themselves. Those countries that are currently worst affected have asked for this. Therefore, it is simply up to us to implement this decision. I think that the scheme is unreasonable. Those of us here, who are forced to legislate on this, should clearly have been involved from the outset in the discussion on the form this IMO decision should take. We cannot now stand here and claim that we would react at five minutes to twelve when the whole debate on the consequences of the decision took place at five minutes past twelve. If I had been able to stop this from happening, I would have done so, but unfortunately, the opportunity did not arise.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, four years ago, the global decision to establish this more stringent Sulphur Directive was taken. All of the governments of the EU were involved in that decision.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our task has been to translate this into EU legislation. We have had tiny opportunities to change the content, but I think that we have nevertheless succeeded on a few points. This does not mean, however, that we can be satisfied with the result.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We can be satisfied with regard to the environmental and health aspects, at least as far as the northern half of Europe is concerned, as the requirements mean that we are moving a step towards treating our environmentally damaged seas, our seas that are struggling to survive, and thus also jeopardising the survival of human beings, in a better way. We need to be aware that the requirements for emissions from transport on land are a hundred times higher than those for maritime transport. That really is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the problem is that we are placing a great deal of pressure on the northern half of Europe and no additional pressure on southern Europe, at least, no significant additional pressure. We are creating a divided Europe. That is not acceptable if we are to have a common internal market. I now hope that, with our proposal, we have been able to even out some of the differences, and the work must continue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur. We have recently enjoyed very constructive cooperation on this subject in particular. The result that we have before us today is a compromise, and it is in the nature of compromise that everyone is both satisfied and dissatisfied with it at the same time. Overall, it is a step in the right direction when it comes to the quality of marine fuels in the European Union. We have been making policy on air quality in other areas for years and, in my opinion, we often overshoot the mark and pass measures that are not particularly efficient. In this case, we are on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, I have certain objections here. In reaching agreement so quickly at first reading, we have disregarded some of the arguments and concerns of some players in Europe’s internal market. In 2015 at the latest, when it becomes compulsory to use what are, in fact, sulphur-free fuels in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), which is essentially in the North Sea and the Baltic, there may be consequences of this legislation that can already be foreseen today but which, at the end of the day, we are completely ignoring. It cannot be in the interests of this legislation if more expensive fuel for goods transport by ferry in the North Sea and Baltic results in goods vehicles turning around at the ferry ports and going by road instead, where this is a possible alternative to short sea crossings. We have given no thought to that, and it was not considered when the Marpol Convention was concluded either. We have simply disregarded this argument. Consequently, I fear that we will have to look at this situation again in the northern regions in two years’ time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it is important to harmonise things in Europe, but we also have to be clear that this cannot happen at the very highest level. I can quite understand some of the arguments from southern Member States, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, which are dubious about this idea and feel that they have other priorities than the introduction of sulphur-free fuel. It costs money, and you can only ever spend your budget resources once. Consequently, I see this as a step in the right direction but, in the end, unequal competition within the EU has been written into the legislation here.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point is that compensating Northern Europeans for their hardships by means of State aid cannot be the way to go since, in the end, this would distort competition between the countries of Northern Europe. Some countries will pay, while others will not.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent cooperation. The maritime industry would claim that shipping is an environmentally friendly means of transport. I therefore think it is wrong to complain about the fact that we are asking the industry either to stop burning waste – which is what it has in its tanks now, that is what we can liken bunker fuel to – or when it does burn this waste for it at least to treat it. These are entirely reasonable requirements that will save 50 000 lives.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The stricter regulations in the Baltic Sea are entirely to be expected, as it is an extremely sensitive sea. No organisms are perfectly adapted to brackish water. The organisms are sensitive. It is logical to have more stringent rules there. Not everyone can install scrubbers and change vessels at the same time. It is good that some are leading the way. The costs for this have been hugely exaggerated. They are equivalent to a fifth of a cent per share dividend for those companies that need to invest in this. We can afford this. The alternative, in other words not implementing this, is not something we can afford to do, however.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Ms Hassi, I am opposed to the adoption of this report, and I also urge others to vote against it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report contains massive flaws that would have a very adverse effect on my own country, Finland, and northern Europe as a whole. The Finnish economy is totally dependent on exports. In all, 90% of Finnish exports travel by sea. The additional annual cost to the Finnish export industry that would result from this directive is estimated at more than EUR 500 million. It is thought that job losses would increase to 20 000. At the same time, the benefits from regulation on sulphur emissions, which is far tighter than elsewhere in Europe, to natural conditions in the Baltic region will be minimal. This decision is unfair and contrary to the European spirit because it favours some Member States while punishing others. If a directive comes into force that imposes regulation on the Baltic Sea area that is five times stricter than, for example, that in the Mediterranean, it will distort competition in the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The forestry company UPM has now said it intends to move part of its paper production operation out of Finland if the directive is implemented. UPM’s Managing Director has said that 300 tonnes of paper now produced annually will leave the country and it will be manufactured in the future in the company’s plants in central Europe. This is a clear example of the directive’s blatant unfairness and distortion of the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is time to put an end once and for all to the fact that, every year, tens of thousands of people in the EU die prematurely because of marine emissions. Outside the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), ships’ engines are more or less burning special waste. On this, the EU is lagging far behind the US and Canada, where only low sulphur fuel can be used in coastal areas. As far as I am concerned, this proposal to amend the directive represents a clear improvement, and this is partly down to the tenacity of the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="de">Better limit values are only half the battle, however. Equally as important is the fact that these are then implemented and enforced. There are certain loopholes, as a result of which it cannot be ruled out that shipowners will be able to evade the directive if, for example, a shipowner apparently proves that he is unable to store low sulphur fuels. It really comes down to the Member States and the Commission here. They must implement the regulations and impose painful penalties when necessary.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my apologies for my delay this morning. I would like to agree with my Finnish colleague and, while I agree with the main concerns of this proposed directive and believe that it is important to improve and protect the maritime environment through reductions in the sulphur content of marine fuels, there are still a number of areas that need close attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal is in clear conflict with the principle of equal treatment of Member States regarding internal market agreements across the EU. The different sulphur limits set between the Sulphur Emission Control Areas in northern Europe, including the English Channel, North Sea and Baltic Sea, and the rest of the EU will create disadvantages across the maritime sector, leading to increased costs for shipowners and operators and causing modal back-shifting, which will lead to increased congestion and an increase in CO2 emissions. Any assessment by the Commission must take this disparity into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, it is also important to ensure that the technology required by the maritime sector to meet conditions of this directive within the timeframe is widely and affordably available. My information at the moment is that there is insufficient cleaning equipment available. There must also be assurances to those wishing to invest in alternative fuels, such as liquid natural gas, that the investment will be made in the infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the way she has taken this report through Parliament. There is no dispute that action needs to be taken in the marine sector. At the same time, however, we have to bear in mind that shipping is international in nature and has very long investment cycles. Nonetheless, this is a good compromise. You can tell that from the fact that so many Members have already complained about it. I believe that it is balanced.</p>
      <p sl="de">It needs to be pointed out to the northern Member States, in particular, that they have already agreed to the whole package in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and in the Council. It is precisely their region that is most affected by marine emissions and in which the greatest health problems have arisen. Consequently, that is where action most needs to be taken. There are thus objective reasons that justify this division of Europe into two here.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also clear that we see a need for action here because, otherwise, in 2020, all the successes that we have achieved in terms of clean air on land would be invalidated by the significant increase in marine emissions. At the same time, we must make sure that we adhere to the transitional periods. That is why we chose 2020, in order to give the shipping industry time to make the changeover and also in order to be able to make the fuels available to them. That is currently the biggest problem. Let us bear in mind, however, that each euro invested here is well invested and will be worth many times that amount in terms of saved health care costs and quality of life. That can only be right.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the following fact: the sulphur content of marine fuels has been falling steadily for several years. This is a welcome trend, because it improves the quality of people’s lives and protects the environment. This also applies to the Baltic Sea and the countries which lie around it, so it also applies to Poland.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be noted, however, that the reduction in sulphur content now being proposed is to be a severe one. Only a few years ago, the sulphur limit for fuel was 1.5%, today it is 1%, and in a few years, it is to be 0.1%, so there is to be a tenfold decrease. Such a requirement puts many of Europe’s shipowners in a very difficult situation, and the cost of fuel, which will have to be higher because it is going to be of better quality, may reduce the competitiveness of this form of transport. These shipowners should therefore be given technical and financial assistance, and this is something which should be provided by the Union and, in particular, by Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this is a good day for Europe: we are finally again tackling air pollution caused by sulphur. We all know that this type of pollution has a major impact on our air quality, as well as our water quality, and it is really important that we do something about it. We need to look at shipping, in particular, because, in 2020, shipping in Europe will produce more sulphur emissions than land-based sources of pollution. We will finally ensure a level playing field by doing something about shipping now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To all of you who have talked about a level playing field in this Chamber, I say this: at the moment, shipping produces 2 700 times more sulphur emissions than freight transport. And so, by tackling sulphur emissions, we will ensure a level playing field. This is a good day for Europe and it is this path that we should continue to follow.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we have to remember a basic fact: this is a very important directive on health and the environment, and one that will actually save human lives. This is important.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would be even happier if there had been an opportunity for more fine-tuning. For example, it would have been fair if the same stringent limits had been imposed on all European countries, which is what the rapporteur, Ms Hassi, endeavoured to do at first. It would also have been fair if, for example, my country, Finland, which asked for a transitional period – which would have been very important for its industry, economy and employment figures – had had its request granted. We have failed in these fine-tuning strategies, and that is why it is understandable that in many countries, people are very dissatisfied, because this affects employment and regional development very greatly. However, the EU’s powers of decision are limited here.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we may not have a perfect compromise on the table, but it is a reasonable one. Of course, it is a shame that low sulphur marine fuel will not become mandatory in all European seas. At the moment, it is only the Baltic Sea, the English Channel and the North Sea that are benefiting from low sulphur fuel and that is a pity. On the other hand, we have prevented a situation where all the other seas in Europe are not required to comply with the requirements. We have made several agreements regarding those seas as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is, therefore, the maximum that we have been able to achieve and I think that it is also good that we, as Parliament, have made a clear statement regarding what is commonly known as shore-side electricity. That, in my opinion, is a huge achievement for the residents of a number of ports in Europe, such as Rotterdam. To sum it up then, this is the best that we have been able to achieve. I support the Hassi report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after months of work, as I was saying, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have reached a compromise concerning the amendment to the directive on the sulphur content of marine fuels, as we know.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This text, on which our three institutions have reached a consensus, is the result of a long process of negotiations in which we participated fully with a small number of colleagues. Not all of our expectations were met, but I am delighted with one particular point where our commitment has borne fruit. The directive, as amended by Parliament this week, will allow Member States to request the revision of the Marine Pollution (MARPOL) convention within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in order to ensure a deadline for the application of newly authorised sulphur levels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, a strict application of MARPOL could add unacceptable constraints to an already very precarious sector, which is forced to invest in very long cycles. On this point, the report by Satu Hassi allows for, in my opinion, an intelligent balance between environmental and economic requirements. We must never forget that the future will be built by ceasing to set the environment against the economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While it is often criticised, on this issue, the European Union is proving that it can act as a real lever, and our governments – and I should say ‘but’ our governments – are now fully responsible for realising this work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, it is essential that we take action quickly in this area. Look at the figures: 50 000 deaths, solely as a result of the pollutants contained in marine fuels. The level of lung disease and respiratory disease in Europe is increasing dramatically. Above all, we should think of the children and focus on them. The patients are getting younger and younger. I urge you to set stringent standards in future in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, we want to shift transport from the roads to the waterways as far as possible. However, we cannot allow that to result in additional air pollution, and therefore also in additional deaths in Europe. We want the opposite. We want healthy air. We want healthy children. We want a clean environment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I should like to point out once again that the European Union has set out its position clearly as regards its transport strategies. From Road to Sea, Short Sea Shipping and Motorways of the Sea are eloquent examples of this. I would also like to clear up a few myths that are being spread here, suggesting that ships are more or less floating waste incinerators on this blue planet. Specific energy consumption per tonne and kilometre, per passenger and kilometre, is at its lowest in shipping, better than for rail and better than for the transport of goods by road.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is essential, Commissioner Potočnik, that we agree on a sensible investment programme for the introduction of new fuels, because if we are moving towards diesel quality, then we still have not yet had an impact assessment, which would ask whether things will then move in the opposite direction, from sea to road. That is exactly what we do not want to happen. Consequently, if we want to make new fuels such as LNG available, we need to build up an infrastructure in our Baltic and North Sea ports that allows shipping to fill up with these fuels. The flue gas desulphurisation facilities, known as scrubbers, also need to be developed further. These are very important things, which is why I wanted to draw attention to them once more.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Hassi, for the work that she has done. This issue is a very difficult one, and she has certainly worked hard to promote it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is quite obvious that we have to reduce sulphur emissions, but the way in which we are now approaching the matter is very unfair, as has already been made clear here. First of all, it would have been a good move if there had been a longer transitional period for the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). Now, the SECAS have to lower their emissions to 0.1% by 2015, while countries in southern Europe can keep their 3.5% emission rate until 2020. This puts competition in a very unfair position. We would also have liked a rather longer transitional period for developing sulphur scrubbers, and I wish that this had been considered. Nevertheless, we have to remember that what we in the European Parliament decide will be very restricted in nature, because these decisions have already been taken by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), as well as by the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU is obliged to comply with international obligations in this important matter and we have a timetable to meet. Within the opinions prepared, some mention has been made of the possibility of what might be described as the unintended consequences of this proposal. These include the potential of diverting ships to ports in those countries that choose to circumvent international obligations, as well as diverting the carriage of goods from sea transportation to roads, which counters policy elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">As well as issues about ocean-going ships being able to comply with the timetable, there is a related issue as to where the lower sulphur content fuel will come from. Refining capacity for these fuels is not infinite and there is no doubt that the obligations the EU wishes to meet in a little over two years time will increase demand. Consequently, there is a danger that demand will outstrip supply, with the result that fuel prices for those marine sectors that already use low sulphur content fuels, such as our fishing industry, will be further squeezed, thus adding to the pressures faced by that sector. We should be wary of unintended consequences.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the basic objective of the directive is to improve and apply maximum limits to the sulphur content of marine fuels, as agreed by the International Maritime Organisation. An effort has been made to go beyond those provisions and apply stricter limits. The compromise achieved is satisfactory. Clear progress and a clear improvement have been made. However, I still have certain misgivings, mainly concerning the review clause. Before reviewing the directive, we need to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the impact of its application. I also believe that the new legislative initiative in 2013 already provided for undermines the predictability and stability of the economic environment, We are all aware of the vital importance of investment, especially in the current recession. We therefore need to combine realism with ecological awareness.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Parliament constantly supports the objective of encouraging maritime transport, given the low environmental impact it has. The Commission should make full use of instruments such as Marco Polo and the trans-European transport network, by which I am referring, in particular, to the short-distance maritime corridors, to provide prompt assistance and increase the proportion of maritime transport among all the transport operations carried out in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States might also feel it necessary to offer support to the operators affected by this directive, in line with the applicable regulations on State aid. We wanted to use the amendments tabled and adopted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism to call on Member States to encourage the use of electrical energy generated onshore as an alternative, in order to ensure the balanced availability and distribution of marine fuels and reduce the emissions caused by maritime transport.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the agreement reached by Parliament and the Council reflects what was unanimously approved by the Member States concerned in the International Maritime Organisation. These seas have disconcerting levels of acidification. Moreover, their capacity for regeneration is very limited. The fuels required are going to be more expensive, and therefore there are plans for financial aid for businesses, which is very reasonable.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some Members, however, have sought to have the requirements for new fuels applied to all the Union’s seas. We would find ourselves with a paradox in that we would be trying to solve an environmental problem of some Member States by creating a major economic problem in the Mediterranean, which does not have that environmental problem, but does have other environmental problems, the costs of which we are not seeking to impose on the other Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on the question of reducing the sulphur content of marine fuels, we should try to reach a compromise between maintaining standards which are safe for health and acknowledging the realities of economic competition. This is particularly the case when it comes to consignments from countries outside Europe – from the developing world, for example – where fuel standards are significantly lower. We should therefore stay with the proposed limit on the sulphur content of fuels used by vessels coming to Europe and leave these other countries time until 2020 to raise their standards and make their fuel less harmful.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition to this, the International Maritime Organisation should also take action to reduce other emissions, and the European Union should accept and adopt current international agreements on the sulphur content of marine fuels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, air quality is an important topic in the European Union, particularly in the coming year, which is the Year of Air. We should take heed of this and work to ensure that progress is made in this area. However, we also have to take into account the fact that maritime transport is currently facing one of its most severe crises. I have major concerns regarding the technology that is to be used to provide clean air. In this area, we must make sure – and that includes in the financial perspective – that alternatives are pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="de">As my fellow Member has just said, LNG is a very good alternative in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). However, for this we need research and development. It is also an economic recovery plan for our shipyards, particularly in the case of scrubber technology, which has not got that far yet. I sometimes get the feeling that some of my fellow Members believe that the required technology is just sitting on the shelf waiting to be used. It is not. I would therefore like to see greater focus on promoting technology, so that we really can have clean air in our ports and port cities. Please would you also pay heed to who foots the bill at the end of the day.</p>

    <intervention id="2-039-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to comment on five points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, it is obvious from your interventions that this is not an easy compromise, but it is a compromise which has been reached. It is a good, reasonable compromise, one which I believe is really important. That is why I would encourage you to support it by voting for it today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the fact is that whatever means of transport you take has an influence on air quality, be it air, land or water. As some of you have mentioned, it is true that travelling by water is many times more environmentally friendly than travelling by land. But if we want this to remain so, we have to adopt the proposal which is on the table today.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of today’s proposal, the contribution for the shipping sector, which I believe is a good one, has already been completed for other sectors, so in a way this represents a kind of catching up. I have listened carefully to the others – especially from the Transport Committee – underlining the necessary transitional measures, because whatever transition you undertake, you will always have something which has a negative influence on others. That is why we believe that we have to help those people, and we foresee with the directive the possibility of complying with the sulphur standards by using alternative abatement methods.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission presented a number of actions for mitigating undesired impacts, as I mentioned in the staff working document. In the short term, it is foreseen to use the existing EU financial instruments and programmes, trans-European transport network and Marco Polo, and possible national State aid funds to support the deployment of new infrastructure and superstructure in support of green ship technology, LNG scrubbers and short-side electricity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The compromise proposal also contains a provision on financial assistance allowing Member States to grant State aid that is compatible with the EU rules and guidelines. In the longer term, we are considering green technology and alternative fuels (notably LNG), regulatory measures for the safe and secure implementation and use of green technology and alternative fuels, green infrastructure and superstructure, possible economic and funding instruments, public-private partnerships and, of course, as was mentioned, also research and innovation. So all that is foreseen and is important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also understand some of you who have had mixed feelings from a geographical point of view. To be clear about the Commission’s position: we believe that the extension of the Sulphur Emission Control Areas – SECAs – to other zones in European waters, especially in the Mediterranean, would yield promising heath benefits. SECAs are a cost-effective tool for addressing air pollution. However, any extension of SECAs would require, in particular, that the Member States themselves introduce such a request to the IMO. Implementing unilateral EU action in this field could be very complex – irrespective of its legal feasibility – and would definitely require further analysis. I would just like to inform you that, apart from the political and legal considerations, the Commission is currently studying the benefits of extending SECAs to all EU territorial waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, as Mr Groote mentioned, next year, our focus will be on air pollution, and we will come with a review of the air policy, including a review of the NEC Directive. More and more scientific facts clearly show the impact of air pollution on human health, and it is simply impossible to ignore this.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final comment: as one of your colleagues mentioned, coherence between economic activity and the environment is, of course, of fundamental importance. I think that the proposal which is in front of you is the best example of how to approach in this context the idea that prevention is much better than cure. Thank you again for your work and support. It was excellent work and I hope it will also have your support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all colleagues for this very constructive discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">As several colleagues have mentioned, there will be a difference in environmental requirements for shipping in northern and southern Europe, but this difference already exists. In the Baltic Sea, the English Channel and the North Sea, the sulphur limit for ships is now 1%, while it is 3.5% for the other EU seas. From 2015 onwards, the difference will be even greater. It is very important that the Commission carefully monitors the impact on transport modes, and it should act if there are any signs of a modal shift from shipping to roads. It is also very important that the Commission monitors the impact on industry in the northern European areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with everyone who has said that it would be fair in terms of competition, as well as in terms of human health, to have the same limits in northern and southern Europe. Therefore, I very much welcomed what Commissioner Potočnik said. This is actually part of this compromise, namely, that the Commission is studying the impact of extending the 0.1% sulphur limit to all EU territorial seas. I believe that this will prove to be the most cost-effective way to meet the EU air quality standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, all experts to whom I have spoken see that LNG gas is the future fuel for shipping. It is both cleaner, meeting all environmental standards, and cheaper. I think that one of the most important measures we need to take is to speed up the LNG fuelling infrastructure in EU harbours. The technology for using LNG in ships exists. In my country, for example, that technology is being produced. I really hope that these new rules will prove to be a boost for greener shipping in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">While I am in full sympathy with the proposal to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions from marine fuels, I would like to express certain doubts about this legislation. I do realise the Commission’s calculations are clear in their objective: the monetary value of the benefits of carrying out this reform is expected to exceed the costs by a factor of between two and 25. I am also aware of the fact that no price can be put on human health. However, while the benefits associated with this project are to be enjoyed by all citizens to a certain extent, the costs may end up being concentrated in centres associated with transport and the maritime industry.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It so happens that I come from Szczecin, a city which is quite right to be worried about this. If it is true that the people of such cities in particular are to bear the burden of this directive, serious consideration should be given to adopting measures or instruments designed to ease this situation. Furthermore, I would like to point out that the tenfold reduction in emissions in Sulphur Emission Control Areas – and the Baltic Sea is also part of one such area – is to be delivered as early as 2015. This poses the question as to whether it is technically possible to ensure the supply of sufficient quantities of fuel by this time. I think these reservations are sufficiently serious to make us think carefully about how we vote on this directive.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I am absolutely in favour of environmental protection and health protection. It is important to safeguard the cleanliness and vitality of northern sea areas, but protection should not be introduced at any cost.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The rules on transition are far too stringent for sulphur emissions in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). For example, Finnish industry will not have time to adjust to the emission restrictions so quickly. The directive will also mean that different Member States of the EU will be treated unequally. This runs counter to the principles on which the internal market operates. Logistical conditions in Finland are already very challenging. As they stand, the regulations will cause the Finnish economy to incur considerable costs. It would be irresponsible to understate the consequences.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Marine fuel contains, on average, 2 700 times more sulphur than diesel for lorries. As a result, shipping accounts for 30% of sulphur dioxide emissions in the countries bordering the North Sea. The efforts we are making on land are increasingly at risk of being cancelled out as a result of increasing ship emissions. In particular, people with asthma and other lung diseases are suffering due to high sulphur concentrations in the air, accounting for about 50 000 premature deaths in the EU. The estimated cost of this switchover (between EUR 2.6 and 11 billion) will be amply offset by health care savings of around EUR 30 billion. As a result, north-western Europe will be in a win-win situation. The Channel between the United Kingdom and the North Sea coast is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world and, because of our geographical location, we experience first-hand the many disadvantages of shipping emissions. In addition, millions of Europeans live close to our major ports. It is good for the competitiveness of our ports that these areas that are subject to stricter conditions should be extended. The need to make use of the more expensive low sulphur fuels will, as a consequence, become less of a competitive disadvantage. At the same time, we need to strengthen our efforts concerning shore-side electricity in ports and the switch to using ships that run on liquid natural gas (LNG), the environmental impact of which is significantly lower.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I welcome this proposal to amend legislation related to protection of the environment. The air pollution caused by the sulphur present in marine fuels is an important problem, particularly in view of the solutions currently being applied to land-based sulphur emissions. I think maritime transport needs rules which will reduce the effect of the emission of pollutants both in the maritime environment and on land. The most important challenge is to establish stricter limits on sulphur content: a reduction to 0.1% inside Sulphur Emission Control Areas by 2015, and a reduction to 0.5% outside these areas by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is possible for fuel standards and legislation on methods of reducing emissions to be tightened while upholding the principles of sustainable growth. By promoting high standards of environment protection at the same time, Europe will become more competitive. The predicted ecological impact will be similar in northern and southern Europe, so the limits should not differ significantly either. Another important question which we should not forget is passenger ships, which should also be covered by the tougher restrictions. This is because we want to concentrate on ensuring a level playing field to all enterprises regardless of their size, while respecting the environment and the principles of a sustainable economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order to avoid upsetting the balance of competition with countries from outside the European Union, marine fuels which exceed the current maximum 3.5% sulphur content will be permitted for use only by incoming vessels, but only until 2020, and I think this is warranted. Starting from that year, all vessels sailing in EU waters will have to comply with this legislation. To ensure a smooth transition, there are plans for programmes which will facilitate the implementation of methods for reducing emissions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the rapporteur, I can proudly announce that today, this House will discuss and, even more importantly, adopt, by a very large and broad majority, the Energy Efficiency Directive. This was a huge collective effort by us as Members of this Parliament and, of course, by all the staff involved. I am proud that once again, it was the directly-elected European Parliament, which, after having brought Europe on to the right track on the internal market and on renewable energies, has again been the most progressive institution in making this compromise possible at the end of the day.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why is this legislation also important for citizens and businesses in Europe? This is an anti-economic crisis and anti-job crisis directive. Our economies in Europe are also weak because, in 2011 alone, we lost the astronomic sum of EUR 488 billion in having to buy oil, gas and other energy supplies. This is the single biggest wealth transfer out of the European economy to oligarchs in Russia and elsewhere in the world. It is six times bigger than at the beginning of the century and constitutes almost 4% of our GDP. I am proud that with this directive, certain oligarchs in the oil and gas market will earn less money.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, many people will be happy about this directive. Firstly, all the people in Europe who are complaining about energy costs being too high. We do not control the oil price, but we can help citizens to invest in reducing their energy consumption. With this directive, we are creating businesses opportunities, above all for small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction sector. It is also good news for jobs in Europe. What I also want as a priority in transposition is for these investments to be linked to training, especially for young people in Europe. It will be so much better, bring so much more hope, if, with this directive, we can deliver not only organisation of energy in the future, but also guarantee the professional future of many young Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have one more minute in which to outline two or three priorities for where we go from now on. First, of course, is financing. It is very important that, in the context of the discussions on the EU budget, we now make energy efficiency a priority for the Structural Funds; we need project bonds for efficiency; the European Investment Bank has to step in; and all this requires follow-up action.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there is also the issue of legal implementation. I have three questions on that for the Commissioner, whom I want to thank for his personal, positive commitment to making this deal possible. I should also like to thank his staff. Commissioner, there will be a need for a lot of implementation notes and guidance. I think we should make the most of the range of stakeholders involved and constitute a forum, as was the case for the legislation on ecodesign. Within this forum, stakeholders can bring their expertise to the discussions on the details of implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, going back to ecodesign, a decision on boilers is pending. Maybe in your speech, Commissioner, you can give us some details as to where we are now.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last point is something that is very confusing. At this very moment, the Commission is forcing the UK Government to have VAT rates for energy efficiency products that are four times higher than the rates for gas and oil. This is very disturbing and annoying, so Commissioner, can you explain to us the rationale behind this push by the Commission?</p>

    <intervention id="2-046-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, to start with, I would like to say that of all our energy policy and environmental policy objectives, energy efficiency is the most under appreciated and, perhaps, even the most important issue. That is why, alongside our subsidy policy for renewable energy and alongside the general goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it was necessary for us to look at setting binding targets for energy efficiency – for us as the Commission to do so, but with substantial involvement from Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Looking at the last two-and-a-half to three years, I note that the impetus to make energy efficiency a binding area of work for European energy policy did not come from the Council. It did indeed come from the European Council in 2007, but not since then. The national ministers tended to be reticent, some of them even unwilling, and were not prepared to have binding targets set. Parliament has pushed this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank you personally, Mr Turmes, along with those from the other groups who have been fighting for this. You have not just lobbied hard; you have also been skilful negotiators. After all, this whole issue is not just a matter of facts, dates and statistics. It is also a matter of diplomacy. It was on a knife edge, but it succeeded. You and the minister from Copenhagen, who is not here today and whom I would expressly like to thank, were mainly the ones responsible for a pragmatic, but, in fact, quite credible, success.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is it all about? Firstly, we hope to bring about a reduction in imports of primary energy through energy efficiency – that means using energy well, reducing the amount of energy that is wasted, improving the use of energy and saving energy. Oil, gas, coal, biomass, uranium – the amount we import must not increase further as a result, but be limited instead.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, in the long term, we want to reduce our costs; in other words, the amount our citizens and our businesses have to spend on energy. Thirdly, we hope thereby to reduce emissions and make a contribution to stopping climate change. Fourthly, we also want to utilise the skills that our citizens have – engineering skills and trade skills – and thereby also secure and enhance jobs. Those are the four goals that make binding energy efficiency a sensible course of action at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Looking at the Commission proposal, it did not go as far as many in Parliament had expected: that is to say, at the moment, we have not introduced a binding target. We have proposed binding measures and binding targets for some areas, public buildings and others. However, the proposal does not go as far as some Members of Parliament had expected.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, it was watered down somewhat in the course of the negotiations. Nonetheless, what we have on the table now that is to be debated and passed by you – and in the Council in parallel – is by no means mere empty words. It has substance that will be effective. With what we are currently proposing, we will essentially meet our 20% efficiency target. I am counting on the Member States to implement it on a one-to-one basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not only that, however. We are also counting on there being Member States that do more. In other words, I would expressly like to mention today the idea of a competition. I think it would be terrific if, in two, three or four years’ time, we were able to note that the Member States were not just complying with binding European laws, but were exceeding them – were doing more. I would like to see a competition to find the best Member State that does more in respect of energy efficiency than is necessary under European law. Our work does not end here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I see three tasks for the Commission. The first is checking implementation – implementation in the Member States and the progress reports, in other words, looking year by year to see whether we are making progress in reducing energy consumption. If so, where? If not, why not? We will then submit a progress report still under the current Barroso II Commission – in other words, before the end of our period of office in 2014 – to tell the next Commission, the next Parliament, either that things are proceeding successfully or that more needs to be done at European level by binding means. Then we will approach other sectors with other products by means of ecodesign and eco-labelling in order to be able to make further specific progress in this area, as announced previously.</p>
      <p sl="de">All in all, this is a good day. Bearing in mind that at European level – and that applies both to you and to us – we are still focusing almost entirely on the state debt crisis and the concerns regarding the euro, today’s draft legislation and your compromise result demonstrates that Europe can still shape things, can still act. There is nowhere else in the world that has made such binding progress on energy efficiency as we have in the European Union. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way of cutting down on fossil fuels and CO2 . Per euro spent, we can achieve substantially more by means of energy efficiency than if we invest only in renewable energy. Moreover, electricity that is never used to start with does not generate a requirement for new grids or expensive reserve power stations. I would therefore like to thank everyone who helped bring about this result.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are focusing primarily on incentives. The core of the directive – Article 6 – obliges the Member States to introduce incentives for medium-sized enterprises and for citizens. Anyone who renovates their house or installs new, efficient heating or who buys an efficient washer-drier should be subsidised by the state or, alternatively, by the energy suppliers.</p>
      <p sl="de">For the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, it was very important that the problems involving emissions trading be resolved. The linchpin of European climate policy is not working. I am therefore grateful that the Commission has tabled initial proposals. We need incentives for industry and we also need income for the state to provide these incentives. The Commission needs to make its proposals more specific, however. The Commission has not yet done everything that is in the statement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I consider it crucial to guarantee women access to specialised training and to promote jobs for women in sectors relating to energy efficiency. We also need to create measures for vulnerable social groups so that they will be able to make their homes more energy efficient and cut the cost of their energy consumption.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These measures should be designed with a gender perspective in mind, since women run a greater risk of poverty than men in almost all EU Member States. As regards agreement at first reading, although better than the Commission’s estimates, I think 15 or 17% energy efficiency by 2020 is very little: we must be more ambitious.</p>

    <intervention id="2-049-000" speaker_id="28224" name="Markus PIEPER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group" nationality="Germany" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by saying how pleased I am about the twenty 2020 goals where the environment is concerned. Where CO2 reductions are concerned, we will exceed our target. As regards the share of renewable energy, we will exceed our target. As for energy efficiency, we are going down the right route here, at least as regards energy usage in relation to economic output. Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) was not able to get this definition agreed in the procedure. In the directive, we now equate energy efficiency with saving energy. They are not the same, however. If I save, that does not automatically make me more efficient. The compulsion to make savings could even jeopardise the expected economic growth in many countries. In this respect, the rapporteur’s actions were unfortunate. What he refers to as strip poker sometimes meant provoking the other groups. Sometimes nothing was offered to the Council. There were clips around the ear. A diplomatic process could have achieved more for this directive and for the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">We therefore welcome the fact that, in the end, we were able to achieve some compromises. The savings targets are flexible and can be implemented by each Member State according to their own particular requirements. Early actions, flexibility in the Emissions Trading System (ETS) sector and also the recognition of subsidy programmes and tax reliefs have been taken into account. Finally, we have also saved the local authorities from being forced to renovate 3% of their stock annually. It is a good thing that the Commission and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have had to adjust their wishful thinking, which is out of touch with the real world, to the reality of public finances and high energy prices. In short, there is less of the European planned economy and red tape, and greater flexibility and responsibility for the Member States themselves – all of which will benefit the environment. That is a great result.</p>
      <p sl="de">One thing remains unclear, and that is what influence this directive will have on the ETS system. We did not call for a reduction in the allowances. A revision, yes. We need to be very careful that having more and more European environmental targets – such as in this directive – does not undermine the market economy-based system of emissions trading. If we decide on changes to the ETS system, then the emphasis is on ‘we’. The Commission is not permitted to push through decisions of such consequence in the comitology procedure. In this respect, we call for the comprehensive participation of Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the past year, many people have asked me whether the EU can haul itself out of the crisis. Each time, my answer has been, ‘Yes, if we save energy, that could make a great contribution to pulling Europe out of the crisis’. The EU is expected to spend around EUR 400 billion on imports of oil in 2012 – money that could be spent much better. We have already come a long way towards our targets for renewable energy and for reducing CO2 emissions, but we are not good enough at saving energy. Before we can save, however, we have to invest, and energy savings are a really good investment. Investments in energy efficiency do not just mean that we save on our electricity bills. Investments in renovating buildings and in more energy-efficient technology will also stimulate the European economies and create new green jobs – and these will be local jobs in the Member States, because you cannot transfer jobs such as cavity wall insulation of buildings or energy audits abroad.</p>
      <p sl="da">As we come to vote on the Energy Efficiency Directive today, it is a bittersweet feeling. The directive, as has already been said here, is nowhere near as ambitious as Parliament had intended. On the other hand, I am pleased that, despite everything, we managed to reach agreement with the Council on the fact that we can and must do better. Without the directive, the EU’s energy saving would only be 9% in 2020. With the new directive, we will save 15% and perhaps even more, and it is a sensible step in the right direction. What we lack, however, is a fundamental recognition of the fact that it is not a question of what we can afford to do, but rather that we cannot afford not to do it. I would therefore urge you to vote in favour of the Energy Efficiency Directive, but not to forget that we are still a long way from our goal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Claude Turmes. The gloom-mongers said we would never reach agreement on this directive, but, thanks to his great skill and determination, we did. That was in June. Now we must move on and look ahead at what steps are necessary to make sure the Energy Efficiency Directive is properly implemented and achieves its goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">First, there is the gap. According to the Commission, the text of the EED will achieve about 15% of the 20%. On top of that, the proposed measures on boilers and on cars and fans will take us to 17%. But, as we have heard, the boilers measure is still under discussion in the Council, and the cars and vans legislation has not yet come to Parliament yet. So there is important work to do, and do ambitiously. I am anxiously awaiting the promised additional measures to close the remaining gap of 3%. Commissioner, can we have them this autumn please?</p>
      <p sl="de">Second, there is implementation. The directive calls for all requirements to be implemented by 2014. That is only six years before 2020. I hope that lessons have been learned from the Energy Services Directive. The Commission will need to monitor Member States closely and provide a guiding hand if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, regarding the 2050 national road maps, this could be the most effective measure in the directive if it is carried out seriously. To reach 2050 greenhouse gas reduction targets, the existing building stock needs to use 80% less energy than today. The national road maps must not be vague. They must set out a clear path for that reduction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Energy efficiency is a key part of economic efficiency and, in terms of the economy, we are all in this together. We cannot afford slackers. Every country’s business is everybody’s business. I hope the Commissioner will now commit to the task of making sure that the directive is 100% implemented.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the climate scenarios that I have seen – whether they were from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact, McKinsey or whatever agency – suggest that by far the best way to protect the climate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to invest in energy savings. These measures are also the quickest to implement, though it is these very measures that are implemented very slowly in practice.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The core of the problem is that many millions of people each day take decisions on energy consumption and savings. That is precisely why we need more stringent policy and more innovative policy measures. For example, there is immense savings potential in the energy renovation of buildings, but it will not become a reality unless the Member States take ambitious steps to inform and re-educate people, and which extend to the entire construction industry, from the architects to the plumbers and electricians. That also applies to the European Parliament, incidentally.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last night, when I was writing this speech, we had a power cut. It saved a lot of energy but my productivity went to zero – and this sort of sums up the energy efficiency debate: we need to have stable energy (no power cuts) and to use less energy because we cannot afford our ever increasing fuel bills, but we need to do this without reducing productivity and helping growth at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the ambition of energy savings, and I know that we need to do this without also forcing companies to simply relocate outside the EU. I have also fought for Member States to have the flexibility to introduce savings schemes which suit their own local markets. We also need to be aware that there is no bottomless bank account and to make sure we take cost-effective measures first.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has said that it supports energy savings, but now another part of the Commission has announced that the UK cannot keep its low VAT levels for energy efficiency installations. So it is fine to give tax incentives to fuel wasters but not to fuel savers. That is ridiculous. I agree with this directive – we have got it in the right place – but let us now turn our energy to fighting this crazy tax decision.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, Rolandas Paksas is not here today, so I will speak for him.</p>
      <p sl="lt">One of the previous speakers mentioned a very large figure – 4 billion on energy costs in the European Union. This really is big money. If the European Union fails on energy efficiency, then it will also fail on climate change, energy security and social security. We therefore have to improve our energy security and efficiency and control spending because otherwise, the price per unit will continue to rise. Targeted policies and specific measures must be used to achieve an absolute reduction in energy consumption, which will thus reduce consumers’ spending on energy. Increasing energy prices have a negative impact on low-income households, particularly during the economic crisis. In Lithuania today, prices for centralised heating have become an intolerable burden for residents. It is also essential to reduce the bureaucratic burden in all Member States. I am not speaking about the renovation of buildings. Consumer organisations should also have a greater role in developing a national strategy to protect consumers from unjustifiable price increases. All information regarding energy price increases should also be made public and be publicly accessible. Finally, perhaps the European Union financing percentage for establishing smart energy facilities should be reviewed, so not 50% but more, and I have cogeneration in mind.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like to make a few brief comments.</p>
      <p sl="cs">First, a personal comment. I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere among the entire group of shadow rapporteurs and, despite the reputation of Mr Turmes, I must say that he is an agreeable, tolerant and open partner in discussion, when he wants to be.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Secondly, I would like to say that there is a persistent problem here, which is that energy efficiency and savings are too close in this project. Savings are not the same thing as energy efficiency, and what Mr Pieper said, of course, is true.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to say that some of us had the impression that a way would be found, and that the Commission and the Council would agree on the binding nature of the aims and the flexibility of resources. That would be far better than a result which rather favours binding resources and aims that are not binding but are, on the contrary, flexible.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, implementation will not happen, even when the resulting compromise is quite good, without the involvement of the municipalities and the regions. That is where the problem lies. The same applies to the clarification of terms, many of which – even key ones – have remained rather vague. All of the shortcomings are trumped in my eyes, however, by the fact that the result may be positive for European employment. Two million jobs add up to an argument for giving this measure a try.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Turmes has done an admirable job because he needed courage to move forward with this type of legislation and he has been capable of neutralising the obstacles, which were many and cleverly placed. It was worth the effort, because energy efficiency and energy savings are requirements of any energy policy worthy of that name.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must welcome significant measures such as the requirement to renovate public buildings, the imposition of a cumulative energy savings percentage on energy companies, as well as compulsory audits imposed on large private companies.</p>
      <p sl="es">The work done by Mr Turmes and the other rapporteurs will be in vain if it is not accompanied by decisive action from the Member States. This action must, in turn, be accompanied by a firm commitment to the targets by European regions, towns and the public.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to highlight the participation of the public. Currently, what we are seeing is a great deal of frivolousness among the authorities and the public.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, this is undoubtedly one of the most important legislative contributions in the field of energy in this parliamentary term. Ultimately, there will be few other things that will have the same significance as this Energy Efficiency Directive, and this is as a result of tenacity and hard work. It is as a result of the work done by the rapporteur, but also by shadow rapporteurs who have done truly admirable work, and I therefore congratulate them all.</p>
      <p sl="es">This directive basically has three objectives: it will help to make the European Union less of an energy island, it will help to make climate change targets a reality, and it will also help to develop an energy efficiency market that will make it possible to have greater economic growth through the right technologies.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would, however, like to highlight one thing which I think is the major contribution that Parliament is making to this directive, which is flexibility: flexibility in the 1.5% savings target for energy distributors and sellers, or the target of renovating 3% of buildings; and the flexibility that Member States have to apply alternative measures. This is the key, because there is a great deal of diversity within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for me as a Dane, it is safe to say that although energy efficiency has maybe faded a bit from a public perspective during the current economic situation, the dossier was by far one of the most important tasks for the Danish Presidency and – let us be honest – it was not a walkover for anybody to get a first agreement. There were quite a few hurdles to overcome, but we succeeded.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the Danish Presidency did very well. It managed to balance ambitions between goals and flexibility and recognised when to close a deal in the Council, which was absolutely crucial for further negotiations. Having been in close contact with Minister Lidegaard during and after the negotiations, I know that the Presidency was extremely grateful to this House: to the Committee on Industry, Trade and Energy as a whole and to the rapporteur and the shadows in particular. There were lots of obstacles along the way. Without the impressive strong political will of the European Parliament to get a result, the Danish Presidency would have been sent home with empty hands.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, ambitions were drastically cut, but we have a sound compromise where ambitions and the need for flexibility meet. This is, in particular, thanks to very efficient and professional codecision work between all the European institutions, which is something to learn from in the future.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the compromise over this proposal, which was arrived at with great difficulty, solves a great many of the problems linked to this directive, but not all of them. One of these unsolved problems is the question of public procurement. I think the criterion of energy efficiency in public procurement must be clearly balanced by that of price. It must not be the case that we exchange the high electricity bills we pay today for very high bills for services and goods related to energy efficiency when these services and goods do not produce overall cost savings and are incapable of doing so. I do not think our citizens are particularly interested in whether they pay too much for electricity or too much in the form of taxes levied to pay for energy efficiency. A very harmful role is being played by the linking of energy efficiency with climate policy. Manipulation and administrative correction of the carbon market – only because this market produces unexpected results – is very bad news for businesses, because it compromises the profitability of business done in the European Union and undermines confidence in legal transactions conducted here.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to take my turn in congratulating Claude Turmes on an exceptional and balanced report. A great deal has already been said, to which I should like to add the following: one way of turning energy efficiency into a source of energy is to communicate with the citizens of Europe in a bid to encourage a certain type of behaviour. I propose that we integrate the principles of energy efficiency and energy savings into national school curricula. We could also run European information and guidance campaigns for European citizens in order to encourage energy awareness and the right behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I also want to congratulate Mr Turmes on the agreement achieved with this directive. We know that energy efficiency is, undoubtedly, one of the most powerful anti-crisis measures that we in the EU could currently have. We have had enough of punitive austerity policies without a cent of investment in Europe’s economies and energy efficiency can be one of these areas for investment. We see the waste that we have in terms of consumption; we see the throttling of many European companies, particularly because they cannot pay their energy bills; and we also see that we are extremely dependent on fossil fuels and the oligarchies that produce those fossil fuels.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore obvious that this investment has to be taken seriously and we cannot continue treating energy efficiency as some sort of garnish for governments to use however they choose or to abandon if they feel like it. It is, in fact, an anti-crisis policy; it is an investment policy. The EU plays a key role here and, if we want growth and jobs, energy efficiency is a means to that end.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the power of Brussels is, fortunately, restricted through subsidiarity and the Treaty. Subsidiarity means that Brussels is unable to interfere with matters on which Member States can themselves regulate. The Swedish Parliament has officially protested against this directive but Brussels is, as ever, ignoring the interests and sovereignty of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU explicitly sets limits on the EU’s powers in the field of energy. This article states that Brussels is not allowed to interfere with the operation, choice or structure of energy supply in a Member State, whether it is efficient or not. The current proposal on the efficient use of resources is therefore not only contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, it does not even have a legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why are we voting on this? What Brussels is actually concerned with is the organisation of the European Union itself. And there we can definitely achieve efficiency gains. We have huge numbers of officials, we are getting one new agency after another. We have an incredibly costly and an utterly failed euro policy and all those things are not necessary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Anyway, we could use our energy more efficiently from now on by talking about the things that we actually have control over. If not, we might as well abolish this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Oettinger and his team for looking at this issue. Energy efficiency is really something to get on our soapbox about. We are all in favour of it, but we all have great difficulties when it comes to doing something concrete about it. It is clear that if we want to bring about a change in the use of energy, and we have all undertaken to do so, then we have to do things not just on the supply side – in other words, investing in renewables – but also on the demand side. Energy efficiency is undoubtedly the most cost-effective way to do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">To be frank, I am a little disappointed with the Member States for being so reluctant to accept a fixed target for energy efficiency as we agreed in 2008. That would have been the simplest way. Each Member State establishes how much it wants to save, and then decides the measures itself. That would have saved us all the red tape on energy that we have created with this proposal and this report. That is actually my main criticism. Mr Turmes was a very tough negotiator. In the end, we decided to accept this compromise. The problem will be that we now have a set of rules that are extremely complicated and laborious to implement.</p>
      <p sl="de">The simple variant – targets, with everyone doing it the way they want to, as has already been mentioned by a number of Members – would undoubtedly have been the most elegant solution. The Member States must be openly criticised for not having been prepared to do this. Please could we also not forget the social problems that are naturally associated with the Energy Efficiency Directive. Buying these new products costs money. We need to watch out that we do not overdo things here. Fundamentally, then, I am in favour. However, we need to see how this is implemented in practice.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, how can I sum up a year’s work in 60 seconds? That is obviously not possible, but there are some points I can make. I would like to thank and applaud the rapporteur and all colleagues who worked on the directive. Parliament has done an excellent piece of work here. The Danish Presidency deserves recognition. With strong opposition and powerful enemies, it was no simple matter. The result can be regarded as a success, because we do have at least something on the table. Without a directive, we would not have achieved even half of the intended objective.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Despite all of the enthusiasm and joy over what we have achieved, the current version of the directive is, above all, a missed opportunity. All of the main objectives, all of the binding objectives, were removed from the proposal by Member State governments, and instead ways were proposed of achieving the objectives contrary to the logic of the issue, despite the fact that Member States have varying heterogeneous conditions. This is what they wanted and what they pushed for here.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I speak with people a great deal, ladies and gentlemen, and I would like to take this opportunity to pass on to you one message from them. People are getting poorer, energy poverty is affecting increasing numbers, and they have had enough of this. We must do something to stop the anger boiling over.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, the planned directive contains measures that include a slew of cost cutting initiatives for boosting energy efficiency. The effort to boost energy efficiency in Europe may lead to positive effects on the European economy, but also on the environment, as long as sensible steps and measures are taken in the area of energy savings which do not interfere in the basic market principles that Western Europe has so long profited from. The Energy Efficiency Directive should bring about these sensible steps.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, the submitted text is a balanced compromise. I primarily support the view that states should have some flexibility in the choice of instruments through which they will help to boost energy saving, because conditions often vary between individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The measures introduced by this directive should motivate and make possible real savings. The directive should not introduce restrictive and unachievable targets and greater bureaucracy, which would harm businesses and end consumers. This proposal must not lead to reduced primary energy consumption in the EU at any cost, and it should take account of other EU objectives, such as competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this directive started off with an advantage and a disadvantage, both of which were very strong. The advantage was that in this House, there is unanimous agreement on the benefits of promoting energy efficiency as the most effective, most direct and cheapest method of ensuring security of supply and competitiveness and of combating climate change. The disadvantage is the current economic and financial situation of many Member States, which are struggling under a terrible recession, which means that both their governments and their businesses, which are fighting for survival, are resistant to anything that involves taking on additional obligations requiring them to make investments.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, in view of the advantage and the disadvantage, we had to find a balance between these two factors, which we have achieved. This balance has been achieved thanks to the way that we work and the excellent quality of the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, and by the shadow rapporteurs and all Members, and to the very positive role played by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Without any doubt, there are occasions when our work takes on all of its European meaning. This has been one of those occasions, and therefore we must congratulate Mr Turmes and all those who have contributed to achieving this great result.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the aim of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was to link the improvement of energy efficiency with major investments in buildings and energy systems in order, at the same time, to be able to help reduce unemployment levels.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If we had managed that, it would have been good. We would have been able to demonstrate an ability to act and to show that we can combine environment and climate policy with social survival-related issues.

The opposition was strong. The bargaining offers were a little mixed sometimes, as the aim was, after all, to achieve something.

      <p sl="de">Personally, I would have liked to see a different result; namely, that we establish a binding target and then give the Member States the freedom to decide themselves how they achieve this goal. That would have meant fewer rules, fewer regulations, fewer reasons for people to get up in arms about European policy and perhaps, at the end of the day, we would even have achieved a better result if we had concentrated on incentives rather than rules. That did not succeed, however, because in the end, we had to reach a compromise and because there was much opposition and many difficulties. Sometimes, Claude, I also thought that perhaps a slightly more flexible approach, less of the all-or-nothing attitude, might have achieved such a result. The result is an acceptable one, but I would have liked to see something better.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the best kind of energy is energy that is not used in the first place. We are not talking here about saving energy, but about using energy more efficiently. There is one aspect of this where I would like us to have gone further, and that is in the public sector. There is huge potential here, a huge backlog of investments among our local authorities. I would have liked to have seen Parliament being more ambitious in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have pushed through this procedure, partly unnecessarily. One Member – one of the shadow rapporteurs – has mentioned it already; I even thought he wanted to vote against the whole compromise. If it is all so terrible, why did he then not push for a second reading? I would have liked the community to take such an important matter to second reading, so that the whole package could be discussed with the chambers and guilds.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good agreement, and it is good that it has so much support. If we can save up to 20% of the EUR 400 billion that we spend on imports of oil and gas, then that is money that can be spent on other things. It is money that can be used for new energy renovation measures. It puts local workers to work. We are creating jobs in Europe. I would have liked to see a more ambitious agreement, but where the energy saving scheme is concerned, for example, I think it is a fantastically good result, and we have got this part on track. We have tried the energy saving scheme in Denmark and it now emerges that we can save even more through voluntary agreements. However, we will have to look at whether we can do something more in the future. I believe that ecodesign can also be expanded into industry, which would benefit the competitiveness of European enterprises on the world market, so there is no doubt that there are still a great many opportunities. There are still low-hanging fruit that can be picked. All in all, however, it is an excellent agreement.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, according to the directive on the energy performance of buildings, Member States must ensure that from 2021, all new buildings and, from 2019, all new buildings which are occupied and owned by the public authorities have nearly-zero energy consumption. However, the Commission has not received so far any national plan on increasing the number of buildings with nearly-zero energy consumption.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The directive being debated today introduces new obligations for Member States, such as renewing every year 3% of the floor space of buildings owned by public institutions to increase energy efficiency.

Over a period of four years, the country’s former socialist-liberal government facilitated the renovation of 280 000 panel buildings, largely from EU funds with contributions from the Hungarian State and the local governments, while citizens needed to contribute only 25-30% to these energy efficiency improvements for panel buildings. This specific example is another indication that energy efficiency is the best way to go. I agree with both Commissioner Oettinger and the rapporteur. It is unfortunate that Hungary’s current government chose not to continue this programme. I ask Commissioner Oettinger and Parliament that we put aside separate funds for this purpose, that is, for energy efficiency improvement, for the period between 2014 and 2020.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, improvements in energy efficiency are considered the most effective measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and any dependence on imports.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It will only be possible if we provide an impetus to innovation and investment, both in product development and services. Therefore, we need efficiency, not energy conservation, if we are to create new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The problem is, of course, that investments are needed first, and only later with the passage of time come savings. Another problem is that those who invest do not always conserve energy. In a time of financial crisis, it is also difficult to find investors in many Member States. For that reason, this directive is very flexible in terms of the measures that should apply to certain countries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, it is clear that the energy efficiency problem could, and should, contribute to achieving the objectives of increased environmental sustainability and economic independence. However, persisting with a neoliberal model has, in practice, simply been contributing to increasing the prices of these goods for the end consumer, thereby also increasing the huge profits of companies that cooperate in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Energy should be considered a basic good of the utmost necessity and many types of consumer behaviour can only be analysed from this point of view. In other words, many people only consume what they need and that is not dependent on the lack of information for consumers. What happens is that many of the companies providing this type of service have a monopoly and charge very high prices. The concept of market liberalisation – the idea that the consumer can freely choose their supplier – is far from proving that it contributes to reducing prices; quite the contrary. As such, rather than rewarding the companies with the lowest energy costs with State aid, it is essential to regulate the energy prices charged by the companies that provide these services.</p>

I asked you three questions: one on implementation and how the stakeholders can be involved, what the situation is with the decision on boilers, and this very important issue of value-added tax in the UK. In communication terms, it is an absolute disaster. The Commission will be ripped to shreds in the British press, and quite rightly too. We cannot pass this important directive on efficiency this afternoon and then, on the same day, the Commission completely interferes with its implementation by one of the largest Member States.

    <intervention id="2-083-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment on the interesting and constructive contributions in five points.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, it was asked why we are enacting legislation at European level at all. Firstly, we have common climate change objectives, and energy efficiency is an important instrument for better climate change policy. Secondly, we have an internal market. That is why energy targets at European level make sense. Moreover, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency is a target that was developed and adopted jointly by Parliament – by you – as well as by the Council and the Commission. Since this decision was made in 2007, we have not really made much progress. That means it is now necessary to arrive at binding European measures if the objective on which you decided, which is greater energy efficiency by 2020, is to be achievable at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the subject of buildings and efficiency is of great significance, not only as regards industrial buildings, but also public buildings, infrastructure and private buildings. We have a problem here. If you take a normal building and renovate it so as to be energy efficient from basement to roof – using state-of-the-art materials and windows, using ICT, using the most efficient modern condensing boilers with the highest energy efficiency, then you will only get a return on your investments – in other words, you will only recoup the costs – in at least 15 or maybe 25 years’ time, as a result of lower energy bills for heating and electricity. In other words, it is an investment for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now imagine a mayor. He is up for re-election in two years’ time. Why should he invest now in renovating nurseries and schools and the town hall when it is not even the next mayor, but the one after that who will reap the benefit? He will probably consider visible renovation of the market place, of old buildings and the pavements, or providing more staff in child care and provision for the elderly, as being more important. We are talking here, then, about an altruistic investment for the benefit of the next generation.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I think it important and necessary to make billions available in our European structural programmes each year for cofinancing in our proposed budget that you will be debating in the coming weeks for the budget years 2014-2020, and to encourage our Member States and our regions and local authorities, which call in the funds, to attach great importance to the subject of energy efficiency. I believe that here, we must provide a carrot, an incentive in the best sense of the word, in order to steer national and municipal budgets more towards energy efficiency in the building stock.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, Mr Turmes, we will be tabling a binding proposal on condensing boilers in a few weeks’ time. The final hearing was a few days ago. I am also prepared to engage in bilateral talks, but we will be consulting on our proposal in the Commission during the autumn and will then reach a decision by the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, value-added tax is naturally a sensitive subject. Like you, I can see that it would be desirable if a lower rate of tax were to create an incentive for energy-efficient appliances and for buying such appliances. However, this is not a matter of policy, but rather a matter of the interpretation of applicable law. I will therefore take up this matter again, but when I made enquiries a few days ago, I found that there was no room for discretion by the Commission and that rather account could only be taken of the objective that the government in London is pursuing by an amendment. I will be happy to provide you with a letter in the coming days, Mr Turmes, showing that there is no room for discretion and why this is the case. It there were, we would be using it. It there is not, then we cannot use it. The only possibility, then, is to amend the appropriate European law.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point concerns the Emissions Trading System (ETS), which was mentioned by Mr Liese and others. When the ETS was introduced – that was you, I was not even here yet then – there were certain expectations, such as the expectation of creating an incentive in the market for reductions in CO2 emissions. There was also an expectation that it would trigger investments in the energy sector, in industry and also in the private sphere in new technologies that would prevent CO2 emissions. Finally, there was an expectation that was not shared by all, but which was assumed in many budgets, that new sources of income would be created to finance sensible new work and expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the long term, ETS revenues in the years 2006 to 2011 averaged EUR 16, 17 or 18; at its peak, it was up to EUR 30, and it is currently EUR 6 to 8.50. A price of EUR 6 to 8.50 is not enough to send a price signal. That means that there is really no longer any incentive for investing in reducing and avoiding CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p sl="de">We, as the Commission, have now tabled a proposal, in July, and decided to postpone the release of certain CO2 emissions allowances that were to be made available each year over the course of the period up to 2020; in other words, not to make them available next year or the year after, but rather at the end of the decade, in order to achieve a certain change in supply and demand and thus also to send a price signal. Counter-argument number 1 is that all this is harmful to planning certainty and undermines the confidence of all players. Counter-argument number 2 is that the target of a 20% reduction in emissions will be achieved by 2020 even with a price of EUR 6. In other words, even without changing our current ETS system, the allowances are sufficient to achieve a 20% reduction in emissions – whatever the price at which they are made available.</p>
      <p sl="de">This autumn, we will have to decide – Ms Hedegaard is leading on this, we are helping – what allowances will not be placed on the market in 2013 and 2014; in other words, what allowances we will hold back. In truth, however, it is not a matter of whether we postpone the release of certain CO2 emissions allowances onto the market, as is our current proposal which is based on the applicable law, but rather it is a matter of whether we decide not to release allowances onto the market at all over the period up to 2020; in other words, in practical terms, creating a shortage of emissions rights overall and not simply postponing their release onto the market. This is a matter that will be discussed in the Commission and we would also like to discuss it with you in the autumn.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is our own problem that is internal to the EU. Let us not be under any illusions, however. There is also an external problem. At the time the ETS was created as a market instrument for reducing CO2 emissions in Europe, we also had an external expectation. We, the European Union, were pioneering this, and our partners in other regions of the world would follow. So far, it seems we were largely mistaken. Australia is following in our footsteps, but with unimaginably low volumes. Have you, like me, been following the election campaign in the US, in Washington? The subject of CO2 and climate change is playing no part in the American election campaign. Consequently, we must assume – whoever wins the election – that there will not be a majority in the next Congress for binding CO2 emissions reduction targets, for binding worldwide climate change. I have no hope of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">China – likewise. Russia – likewise. India – likewise. We have the problem that we, the European Union with its 500 million inhabitants, are responsible for just about 11% of worldwide CO2 emissions. Since we have no partners, the question of where we go from here is one that must be asked not just internally, but also externally, and it must be about how we get others on board.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those are the key points. I believe that the legislation that we have before us today puts Europe on an innovative yet pragmatic course that will, in the end, benefit our citizens, that will not harm our economy, and that can be checked by us and implemented by the Member States without a great deal of red tape. We will be happy to report – whenever you would like us to, but within the next two years – in a progress report whether the Member States have kept their word when it comes to implementation and what progress we are making. If necessary, we may yet have a binding general target during the period of office of the Barroso II Commission, as was mentioned by Mr Reul, and which was generally considered a priority in Parliament, but which it was not possible to get the Council to accept.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, perhaps I could add a couple of words about the directive itself and its architecture. What we have done here is that in March 2007, with the assistance of Chancellor Merkel, a political objective was established: Europe would aim for a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, in renewable energy and in climate change. Laws were then passed on renewable energy and the climate, making them binding. What we are doing here now is actually putting Chancellor Merkel’s promise into concrete legislation and creating a new architecture for energy efficiency in Europe, with a maximum primary energy consumption in Europe in 2020 of 1 474 million tonnes oil equivalent. The Member States must send national efficiency targets to Brussels as early as April 2013. I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for having made it clear that if the Member States do not submit a national efficiency target, the debate on binding targets will be reopened.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank you for being prepared to discuss the issue of UK VAT once more, so that we do not get a bad press in the United Kingdom. What I am still waiting to hear about is the implementation, and the issue of how you are organising yourselves in the Commission. Experience shows that apart from Denmark, Belgium and Ireland, and eventually, to some extent, Poland, Italy and then the new French Government, the others have done nothing but negotiate downwards. If you now go and discuss the whole guidance only with the Member States, then there is a risk that the whole thing will be watered down. I believe that the Ecodesign Forum is the appropriate place, where stakeholders and Member States sit down together at particular times to simply discuss facts only and to ask ourselves what is going on here. It is clear that the decisions between the Commission and the Member States are subsequently agreed decisions. However, we should create such a forum.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank you for having mentioned the Structural Funds. I would then like to move on to the Emissions Trading System (ETS). In the case of the Structural Funds, we are talking about EUR 20 billion by 2020 – if it goes through. If we get the ETS back on track, then we are talking about revenues for the Member States in the order of EUR 120 billion to EUR 200 billion. In other words, the question of how we reinvest in Europe is also related to us getting this ETS market back up and running. However, that is also important for the major energy concerns and the captains of industry. How are they supposed to develop a vision? How are they supposed to elaborate an investment strategy when ETS prices are falling so much?</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one very final word to add. Last week, something happened that I find mind-blowing. Last week, I was informed that Germany’s Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology had attempted to more or less water down or moderate two fundamental definitions in the German translation. I must say that as a Member of Parliament who is negotiating an English text, I consider it institutionally impossible if I can no longer be sure that once the negotiations are complete, governments will not go in and exert extreme pressure on the translators. I would like this to become known externally so that it does not happen again. It cannot be the case, and we cannot allow it to happen, that governments attempt to rein in a fully negotiated text; it makes them look like bad losers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once again, I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation by you all, and I would particularly like to mention the chair of our Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. We have enjoyed positive cooperation with the secretariat, with my staff. We have once again written a little bit of energy history.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The new directive on energy efficiency marks important progress towards achieving the Europe 2020 strategy targets, both in the energy sector and for reducing pollution. The new directive will be able to bring about a reduction in energy consumption, restrict imports, create new jobs and provide social protection. We must bear in mind that achieving energy efficiency does not only mean investing in renewable energy sources or new energy projects but also, primarily, improving existing energy sources and wasting less energy, which is at a very high level at the moment, incurring unjustifiable costs for ordinary citizens, especially for those who are socially vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital that new investments in energy efficiency are economically sustainable and do not give rise to undesirable spin-offs, such as increasing energy costs for end consumers. In addition, I think that these investments must also cover the private housing sector as in many Member States, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, this causes huge energy losses. The same also applies to the production infrastructure and the transportation of energy, which need to be modernised to restrict collateral losses.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This text is realistic and ambitious. The proposed regulatory framework is an important step towards achieving the goals set within the energy and climate package, as well as promoting green growth and employment. With the addition of the European sectoral measures on energy efficiency and the provisions taken at national level by Member States, the European Union should therefore be in a position to meet its indicative target for energy efficiency, set at 20% by 2020. It is essential to fight against waste, control energy use and drive innovation, without reducing our production and economic activity. At a time when the issue of energy costs is on everyone’s mind, let us not forget that the best energy is that which we do not consume. Finally, I am particularly pleased with the provisions of the directive which aim to promote heating and cooling efficiency. However, I do regret that the final compromise does not incorporate my amendment aimed at creating a category of cogeneration units between 1 and 20 MW in remote areas that are disadvantaged and have insufficient electricity, in particular where resources are available nearby. This could have helped stimulate decentralised energy production in rural areas.</p>

      <p sl="pl">According to the report, energy efficiency is determined by reductions in energy consumption imposed from above. This is obviously wrong. The efficient use of primary energy depends on the efficiency and number of conversion processes involved, activation energy and the dynamics of the combustion processes employed (that is, making use of processes which involve lower ignition temperatures), the efficiency of transmission and resistive losses. The 20-20-20 targets require a real improvement in efficiency, not a reduction in consumption. What is needed is to stimulate innovation as a step towards achieving this goal, and not reductions, exclusions and price barriers. The greatest reserves of real efficiency lie in thermal refurbishment, cogeneration and reducing energy intensity. The Member States should measure their efficiency as primary energy consumption per capita in 2020 in relation to a baseline year.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Out of the EU 20-20-20 targets, we have the largest backlog in respect of the energy efficiency target. Many initiatives are already pointing in the right direction, but the results are still dwarfed by the untapped possibilities. Europe has recognised its backlog, and has realised that in the middle of an economic crisis, it cannot afford the luxury of taking the development of energy efficiency lightly. These investments not only cut down our energy bills but give immediate boosts to the economy. However, as long as issues regarding financing remain unresolved, our energy efficiency goals laid down in the directive remain nothing but grandiose targets. Often, the problem does not lie in the lack of determination but in obtaining the subsidies necessary for renovation and raising the required own contribution. I therefore find it a major step forward that upon a Hungarian initiative, an innovative financing instrument has been included in the directive. According to the proposal, the state can sell excess quotas from non-industrial emitters and can use the resulting income for the achievement of energy efficiency goals. The Hungarian proposal allows the own contribution required in energy efficiency programmes to be replaced by the income from quota sales. This allows a large number of investments generating notable energy savings to be implemented despite the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I find it exceptionally important for the future of Europe that we make significant progress in energy efficiency in the upcoming period until 2020. In crisis-stricken times such as these, the promotion of energy efficiency is a vital interest for Europe, because by reducing our dependence on external energy, we could save billions of euro on energy imports, not to mention the resulting improvement in energy security, which has always been among the primary goals of the sector. In addition to the 20% efficiency improvement target for 2020, the present agreement requires Member States to implement the energy-related renovation of 3% of their central government buildings each year, and sets an EU-wide minimum target of 1.5% per year for the energy savings of energy companies. The advantage of the agreement is that it approaches the issue of energy efficiency from many aspects, and can therefore have a simultaneous effect on both the public and the private sector. As a Socialist MEP, I find it particularly important to note that the implementation of the draft would promote job creation, and would encourage invoicing based on actual consumption, thereby promoting the interests of disadvantaged groups. Bearing Hungary’s interests in mind, I wholeheartedly support the objective of the draft that Member States should pay increased attention to the operation of the heating and air conditioning systems in buildings, as one-fifth of Hungary’s population still lives in panel flats, which are especially exposed to this issue. I am of the opinion that if we manage to make actual progress in energy efficiency in the near future, Europe’s recovery from the crisis can be accelerated substantially.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I think that the directive we are discussing today allows great flexibility to the Member States, industry and the public sector, and that it also supports Member States’ efforts to increase efficiency of energy consumption at practically all stages of the energy chain, from conversion and distribution to final consumption. The energy efficiency ratio in the industrial sector went down by 58% between 1995 and 2009, whereas the ratio for the EU as a whole fell by 20%. This reflects a significant improvement in energy efficiency in industry, where it is clearly above the EU average.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An example of the compromise directive’s flexibility are the provisions concerning the shift to high-efficiency cogeneration technology. All newly built or renovated industrial installations must be equipped with a cogeneration system, as long as the cost-benefit analysis of such projects shows a surplus. In addition, where important reasons exist, Member States can decide to set aside this requirement for industrial installations. Further improvements to efficiency will require enormous investment in the short and medium term, because almost half of today’s electricity generating capacity and cogeneration systems are over 30 years old. The need to save energy has existed for a long time. However, both in industry and in domestic situations, current expenses are always more important than investments in increasing energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope the directive will change our point of view, and that a heightened awareness will help us understand how to change the present state of affairs.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Union intended to achieve 20% savings in energy use by 2020. It even included this goal among the five headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy. Based on the results so far, however, it seems that we will be able to achieve only half of that target. It has become certain that we need to make further strategic decisions in order to increase energy efficiency. We are importing increasing quantities of energy at increasing prices, and there have been disruptions in access to energy sources. Energy efficiency is one of the simplest ways to cut back greenhouse gas emissions, ensure that our energy consumption is sustainable, and increase supply security. The largest energy savings can be achieved by reducing the energy demand of buildings. Energy-related aspects must be given more weight when designing buildings, as the energy demand of buildings currently constitutes 40% of the EU’s total energy requirements. Several Member States, including Slovakia, should be encouraged to include among their short- and long-term plans a support scheme for the modernisation of obsolete buildings and for the construction of new houses, with particular focus on passive houses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is one of the two pillars of the European Community. One was and is the union for peace; the second is the internal market. The free movement of goods and products, of workers and companies, of services throughout an environment of 500 million EU citizens. Electricity and gas were latecomers to the internal market. We have had an internal market for food, textiles, vehicles, electrical appliances, furniture and financial services for more than 60 years. Likewise, for oil and coal. Gas and electricity, however, were late to follow, in 1996 and 1998. Since then, we have been working on the implementation of this, on bringing about an internal market. We have achieved a great deal, and we still have some work to do. We have a mandate from the European Council, and also from you, to complete the internal market in 2015. We are working on this by means of legislation, internal market packages, checks, Commissioner Almunia is working on it through specific surveillance of the markets, and also by initiating proceedings against actors in the market. We are working together very well on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is clear – and here I turn to the first question and its answer – is that electricity is not entirely comparable with food or cars. Moreover, electricity and gas need infrastructure. That is why expansion of the infrastructure – transmission networks, interconnectors, cross-border gas pipelines and electricity lines, modern supply lines – is crucial if the regional markets of our 27 Member States are genuinely to come together to form an overall market and if we are also to be able to implement in this market our rules of play, such as competition, transparency, strong consumer rights and thus also an increase in security of supply, and perhaps also pressure on prices.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we believe that the internal market, with competition between suppliers and strong consumers, makes an important contribution to keeping prices and price increases moderate and in proportion. That is why we are pursuing a strategy of diversification. Take gas, for example. Our most important partner is Russia, but Russia does not have a monopoly. Where Russia does still have a monopoly – in the Baltic States, for example – we are creating competition by means of infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, Norway; thirdly, Algeria; fourthly, we are encouraging the construction of LNG terminals and we are also taking an open approach to demonstration products for shale gas in some Member States. In this way, we avoid monopolies setting the price. As a result, the price in the market falls. Energy efficiency is another means by which we can lower energy costs long-term.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, it is the Member States – not us – that are responsible for taxes. There is a European minimum tax rate. The majority of the Member States have much higher taxes. In other words, the Member States have it within their power to lower energy costs for their citizens by reducing taxes.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final point: spending on electricity and heating is spending on basic requirements. That is why the Member States must adjust their social policies – the way they provide financial assistance to people in need – to increases in energy costs. Energy belongs in the European shopping basket just as much as housing, transport and food. Member States have a duty to check energy costs year by year and to adjust their social payments accordingly for the benefit of their needy citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, very briefly this time. Commissioner, you have mentioned several times that, despite the efforts of the European Commission, it is the Member States that may enter into pricing, including in the area of energy policy, using their instruments of tax policy or social policy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore have a question – at this moment, a rather political one – about the future. As the Commissioner responsible for this area, do you think it would be appropriate if we moved faster towards some sort of unification, towards the creation of a common basis for determining, say, tax policy in the area of energy policy?</p>

      <p sl="de">Ms Flašíková Beňová, we will be publishing a communication on the internal market this autumn. In it, we will show how far the internal market has been completed and where we see further measures as being necessary. To answer your question more specifically, I would very much welcome further convergence and harmonisation of energy taxes. It is just that, as you know, harmonisation of tax law requires unanimity, and as Commissioner Šemeta and the Commission in general very often remark, the Member States do not vote unanimously in favour of even sensible proposals for harmonisation of European tax law. For that reason, progress will also be slow in this area. I repeat, however, that I would support harmonisation of energy taxes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commissioner referred to the Council’s deadline of the end of 2014. The internal energy market is a key priority in the Commission’s Energy 2020 strategy and in the Road map 2050.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier this year, the Commission sent reasoned opinions to 17 Member States for failure to implement the Third Energy Package. I would like to ask when the Commission intends to bring infringement proceedings. If the Third Package is about unbundling supply from transmission, will there be a fourth package on physical interconnection of the internal energy market?</p>
      <p sl="en">Would the Commission at least guarantee that most of the EUR 9 billion foreseen for the energy schemes in the Connecting Europe Facility – if we get it – will be spent on electricity interconnection rather than on gas pipeline investments to the benefit of companies who made a combined profit of USD 180 billion last year?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Watson, infrastructure is one of the keys to the internal market. We still have some Member States that have only one supply line and are dependent on one supplier, so they cannot choose their supplier. That is why we want all 27, soon to be 28, regional markets to be integrated in the coming years. In the energy sector, the Connecting Europe Facility – on which we are spending EUR 9.1 billion over seven years – is our instrument for doing this. You are right that the majority of the infrastructure must be financed by the market and by the grid operators and via energy prices. A power line from Rotterdam to Cologne does not need cofinancing. However, if you want to connect, say, Malta with Sicily and Italy, then you need European cofinancing, because the number of gas and electricity consumers on Malta is too small. Likewise, if you want to have a LNG terminal for a state in the Baltic Region – which would make sense – or to integrate Cyprus, then cofinancing is useful in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Four years ago, you, as Parliament, made EUR 4 billion available to us for a crisis programme. We cofinanced 60 projects and today I can tell you that with 10-50% cofinancing, we have succeeded in getting some interconnectors up and running which otherwise would not have come about, or only at a later date. We will submit our list of priorities to Parliament in the spring, detailing which projects we see as being in the common European interest – i.e. which we see as being in the interests of more than one Member State – in order to complete the internal market. You will then decide whether you want them. The Council is heading in the right direction here. In the Council, the subject of the Connecting Europe Facility in the energy sector is already largely accepted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for his answer and his recognition that it is only through interconnection that the market can properly work. Of course, interconnection also creates jobs in the European Union because we are the major – if not the only – manufacturers of the high-voltage direct current cables which are needed for such interconnection.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, would the Commissioner not agree that it is, in a sense, crazy that we are spending millions of euro on solar power in Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom and very little in southern Europe, where there is actually rather more sunlight? Therefore, can we expect the Commission to come forward with a Europe-wide renewables support scheme so that we can do exactly what he was talking about, namely, connect Malta and Italy, with all of the potential that they have, for the generation of electricity from renewable energy?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Watson, you will have read our communication on the subject of renewable energy that was issued in spring this year. We believe that the national subsidy systems for the establishment of renewable energy, namely, wind energy and solar energy, were correct. Now, however, it is increasingly a matter of the European coordination and harmonisation of these subsidy rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">I regret to say that the Member States have not so far utilised the existing possibilities. I will illustrate with an example. Together with the Greek Government, we are now trying to get new Helios projects under way; that means photovoltaics and solar parks in Greece that can be attributed to other Member States, that can be credited to other Member States as they work to reach their 20% target. In general, we believe that we cannot retain 27 national subsidy instruments any longer, but that we must increasingly take a European approach to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second problem is that unfortunately, some Member States have made their laws on subsidies for the construction of renewable energy retrospective or have abruptly ended them. This has had a damaging effect on the principle of confidence in some Member States. It does not create planning security and it unsettles investors. In other words, the principle that a party investing must know what the subsidy will be in the coming years should apply throughout Europe and should not be damaged as it has been in some Member States over the past three years.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioners, certainly the third package, once it is implemented in full, is a very important step forward in the creation of an internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, Mr Oettinger, as you are well aware, in order for legislation to be properly implemented, above all, there need to be truly independent, professional infrastructure operators without interests in other parts of the value chain. It is also essential that there are sufficient infrastructures connecting the countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the current economic circumstances, the trigger for investments should not be only market signals but rather the genuine needs of an integrated energy system.</p>

      <p sl="de">Two instruments play a particular part in our internal market packages. Firstly, unbundling – as you mentioned; the separation of generation and sale on one side and transmission on the other. Secondly, third party access; in other words, opening up existing infrastructure, power lines and gas pipelines to multiple suppliers. We are making good progress on both measures and on both packages. We do not see it as our primary task to take the Member States to court. Our primary task is to advise them and support them as they implement the measures. I can tell you that the vast majority of the Member States are working very constructively on implementation and our Directorate-General is providing them with specialist support in this area. Nonetheless, we do initiate proceedings. We have a number of very different proceedings in progress against various Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner Almunia is responsible for market surveillance. You will have read in the past few days that a major investigation is under way into a large operator in the market to examine whether it is abiding by our rules in the European market or whether its supply contracts infringe European law.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point concerns interconnectors. We are working very closely with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSO-G). Those are the European associations of transmission system operators. We also have specific plans in larger European regions for how the networks are to be expanded in the coming years. Along with the Connecting Europe Facility and our list of priorities, we believe that in the coming 5-10 years, the gas and electricity networks will be expanded to bring about the internal market through a capable infrastructure, just like Europe’s motorways and rail networks, the Single European Sky, or our digital world of communications and information. That is the goal that we have for gas and electricity, too.</p>

    <intervention id="2-111-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, since my colleague Mr Oettinger has mentioned the competences in terms of sound operation of the market, through the instruments for which I am directly responsible, I would like to state once again here in Parliament, before you all, what was made public a few days ago regarding the opening of an investigation into the possible infringement of Article 102 of the Treaty concerning certain activities by the company Gazprom in at least eight Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">If you recall, last year, a series of inspections were carried out in plants that belonged to companies that have signed long-term contracts with Gazprom or with its subsidiaries or companies associated with the Gazprom group. In the light of the information obtained from those inspections, and also based on some complaints received from Member States, the Commission, through the Directorate-General for Competition, has thoroughly analysed this whole case and has concluded that there are serious questions regarding possible infringements by Gazprom within our internal market in relation to three aspects, which concern several of the matters that you raised in your previous questions and in the previous debate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, we think there are serious questions regarding a possible infringement relating to fracturing or fragmentation of the market, with prohibitions signed or included in agreements concluded by Gazprom within the European Union or with agents operating within the European Union. This fragmentation of the market consists of prohibiting exports of the gas received from Gazprom to other EU Member States. This is clear fragmentation of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second objection is the indexation of prices included in long-term gas supply agreements or in similar clauses, with a similar effect. We believe that the conditions that existed in the gas market several decades ago have changed substantially and are changing fast, firstly due to the existence of a spot market for natural gas and also due to the changing conditions of the global market with gas produced by the technique known as fracking and shale gas. This means that there is no longer the same justification for price indexation in long-term contracts as there was in the past, and according to our analysis, it does not comply with market principles; in other words, the interaction between supply and demand that must exist in a market and which we want to exist in our internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">The third objection is that we think that some of the clauses or conditions established in these long-term contracts create barriers that make it difficult for possible competitors to operate in the market and restrict competition, in particular through, for example, conditions relating to compulsory entry points for gas for those signing a supply contract.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the basis for our opinions. What we have done, of course, is open the investigation. Gazprom has been notified and questionnaires have been and are being sent out in order to gather information, not only from Gazprom and its customers here in the EU, but also from all the wholesalers in the gas market and parties concerned in the wholesale gas market that can contribute to ensuring that the competition rules under Article 102 of our Treaty are fully respected.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you know, the Commission’s responsibility in terms of competition policy is to apply the Treaties and make sure they are applied, in particular, Articles 101 and 102, irrespective of the ownership, nationality or location of the companies operating in our market. The nationality of the company is of no concern to us, nor does it concern us who are the owners or shareholders of the company, whether private or public. We are concerned with the impact of a company’s business on the internal market, and therefore we have opened this investigation, just as we have opened many others in the energy, electricity, gas and many other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe it was important to take this opportunity to inform you of this, as there have been some statements made seeking to divert attention away from our sole objective when opening anti-trust investigations: protecting the sound operation of the market. With regard to energy, this is particularly important for all Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have one question for Mr Almunia. I would firstly like to congratulate you on your actions against Gazprom. We cannot accept what they are doing and I think we should also largely ignore Mr Putin’s recent declaration. We have an internal market and they will have to abide by the rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Basically, power exchanges fix prices. In Germany, there are some discussions and some studies that show the following. The prices on the power exchange in Leipzig have gone down over the last two or three years but the contracts, and the reduced costs for the companies and traders buying electricity on the power exchange, have not meant that these benefits have been passed on, particularly to smaller consumers. At the same time, when E.On and RWE presented their balance sheets this year, we – and the media – discovered huge profits. Last year alone, there were profits of EUR 3 billion plus. Some would argue that there is a strong connection between not passing on reduced prices on the Leipzig power exchange and the big benefits for larger – and perhaps also some smaller – companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Are you following this situation, and what can you do to ensure that smaller consumers also get the benefit of reduced prices on the power exchanges? Otherwise, people will lose trust in the pricing.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, it is clear to everyone that we lack investment in infrastructure; that is, in energy infrastructure. We are very well aware that funding is always a huge problem. I actually believe that we can create an increased desire to invest among our European pension funds, among others, by adjusting the guidelines concerning ownership. I would like to state quite clearly that I am very much in favour of unbundling and liberalisation in the energy sector, but if we want to create more investment without compromising on competition, then it is perhaps a good idea to do this. Is the Commission open to adapting the rules in this way, and how can this be done in practice?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-115-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">We will also go into that in our communication on the internal market. We believe that European legislation does not need a general revision. Where unbundling is concerned – in other words, the independence of the transmission network operators – the measures have been taken. It is now a matter of the national regulations offering sufficient incentives and energy policy offering sufficient planning security.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will then get investors, if investors know that a pipeline or a transmission network is necessary, makes sense in the European market, and if the returns are sufficiently fair. We are in talks with the European insurance sector. Life assurance and pensions insurance, in particular, are ideal partners for long-term investments, because they need long-term, low-risk investments and moderate returns for their insurance customers.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one problem, and that is unbundling. A number of insurance companies have told us that they have shareholdings in energy generation, around 5% in the case of ENEL or ENI or RWE or others, and therefore, strictly speaking, they are not allowed to invest in networks. It is clear that our unbundling policy was intended to separate the commercial interests of the generators from the commercial interests of the transmission companies. If a company has a stake of just 3% or 5% in an energy generator, I believe it is still able to invest in the network. We need a pragmatic interpretation here, and we are working on that.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, one of the objectives in implementing the internal market in the energy sector is to reduce energy poverty and increase the access to energy for all citizens, especially to electricity and gas.

We want energy research to be carried out in the public sector using European resources, thereby reducing the burden on consumers. We want to cofinance infrastructure – the Connecting Europe Facility – to the tune of EUR 19.1 billion from European budgetary resources, which will reduce the burden on electricity and gas consumers, and we want to cofinance energy efficiency by focusing our structural programmes on the renovation of European buildings, with the aim of improving energy efficiency and thus lowering electricity bills in the long term, whether for schools, kindergartens or old people’s homes, whether for private dwellings or public infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="de">The European budget is only used to fund infrastructure that will benefit more than one Member State. Why? It is because the basic idea of subsidiarity says that where a transmission network – a smart grid – serves only the local citizens in one Member State, this is a matter for that Member State and for the regional market. What we do is standardise. Together with our partners in the European energy community and in the electrical industry, we are in the process of arriving at uniform European standards for smart grids and smart meters. This is in the interests of the internal market and, since it results in higher volumes and facilitates possible associated cost reductions, it is in the interests of the consumer.

Has the Commission received a draft of such an agreement?

In other words, I cannot confirm your conjecture, but even if I could, it would not be relevant as far as I am concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the area of gas pipelines, we always specify where the point of entry into the European market is. Take Nord Stream, for example. From what point does European internal market law start to apply? The supply lines in the regional European market are then subject to the European internal market law that you have passed. There may be exceptions, but as a general rule, third party access applies. That means everyone has access to every pipeline. Unbundling also applies, so the gas network operators are independent of gas producers and gas users, so that they can play an important, objective role in this energy business.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the launching into operation of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea has relieved some of the pressure on the Ost Stream pipeline carrying gas from Russia to Western Europe through Central Europe. At present, the volume of gas transported through its pipes is at about 60% of the maximum possible. The 40% of the capacity of this pipeline that has been freed up could now help supply the industrial areas of Austria and northern Italy with cheaper Russian gas if it was possible to build a short pipeline connection between Slovakia and Austria.</p>

      <p sl="de">Nord Stream is a project involving two pipelines; the second will be inaugurated in a few weeks’ time. When it is, up to 55 billion cubic metres of gas from Russian sources will come to Europe via Nord Stream, which is around 10% of our total annual gas consumption in the EU. From Greifswald-Lubmin, a German town on the Baltic where the Nord Stream pipeline ends, supply lines take the gas to the markets of Central Europe. These are covered by internal market law. In this respect, we are in sensitive negotiations with our Russian partners as to the extent to which third party access must apply here.</p>
      <p sl="de">The crucial thing is that gas, wherever it comes from, benefits every European citizen. That means we need a functioning internal European gas network with reverse flow and with the possibility of transporting gas from each regional market to every other regional market. The North-South link, for example, from the Baltic to Croatia, a project that we are currently planning, is an important contribution to this. Interconnectors between the Member States are a second part of this. The combination of internal market rules and infrastructure will result, in the medium term, in consumers having equal rights and comparable gas prices throughout Europe, so that we do not have very different gas prices in Lithuania and Latvia, on the one hand, and in France and Germany, on the other.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I asked the question slightly differently. Perhaps it was the translation: I asked whether the Commission was willing also to support a link between Slovakia and Austria, from Eustream to the distribution networks in Austria and northern Italy, in order to shorten the transport distance of the gas, since Eustream capacity currently allows such a link to be supplied.</p>

      <p sl="de">These pipelines are in the European interest. That is why we support them. Whether financial support will be necessary for that depends on two factors. The first is what costs are incurred and whether these are reasonable for gas consumers. Can they be financed in the market by transmission charges, or is cofinancing by the European Union required? Secondly, this will be possible if, in the next few weeks, Parliament adopts the seven-year financial framework and supports the Connecting Europe Facility in the energy sector to the tune of EUR 9 billion. I will then be able to act and will be happy to have talks with the relevant energy ministers and the operators within the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSO-G).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, in order to create competition, which, in principle, I advocate, European legislation has imposed the decoupling of energy suppliers and network operators.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My question is as follows: have you yet to carry out a serious, detailed, and quantified assessment of the supposed advantages which consumers should have benefited from? I am talking in terms of price and customer satisfaction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to recount a personal anecdote: in my house, I have recently suffered serious damage due to over voltages. When there was just a single operator, work was carried out free of charge, as the operator was also responsible for the network. Now, in my country, France, where things were previously much simpler, the network operator and the energy provider are shifting responsibility between one another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now for my question: have you undertaken a customer satisfaction survey, in terms of price, provision of services and maintenance?</p>

    <intervention id="2-130-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Energy customers – in this case, electricity customers – are happy firstly, if there are no interruptions to supply, or if these occur only rarely. You could say that the subject of power cuts plays much less of a role in Europe and that we have much better security of supply than in many Asian countries, for example, or even in the US. We have greater security of supply for electricity than do Americans in Detroit or Los Angeles.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, customers are happy if the price is reasonable. There is evidence that as a result of the opening up of the market, of competition, of the internal market rules, prices in recent years have not risen as much as they would have done had there been monopolies, when electricity consumers cannot switch electricity supplier. Transparency – in other words, knowledge of electricity providers and their prices and contractual terms – is part of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, many citizens – not all of them – are, as electricity consumers, also interested in other matters such as protection of the environment, sustainability and climate change. We are working for those, too, and we believe that therefore, the internal market and our European energy and climate policies have helped consumers, and that the further completion of the internal market will help them further.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like very briefly to add to the answer by my colleague, Mr Oettinger, because, thinking about electricity users and, in particular, domestic users and their families, obviously from the point of view of my responsibilities as Commissioner for Competition, I have instructed my services to monitor the situation of the market in electricity and other energy sources very closely and continuously.</p>
      <p sl="es">If you recall, there was a sector enquiry a few years ago, when the Commissioner for Competition was Neelie Kroes; since then, a whole series of measures has been implemented based on what we assessed in that enquiry.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the specific case of France, there have been decisions that help the market work better, although the concentration of that market is obvious, with an extraordinarily powerful main operator. I can tell you that we are currently particularly monitoring some of the actions of that operator in the market.</p>
      <p sl="es">I cannot reveal which actions, or the stage that our investigations have reached, but you can rest assured that we are not forgetting electricity users and, in particular, domestic users. This includes those in the longer-standing Member States, where the Commission has already adopted decisions on competition relating to some of their largest operators, based on the enquiry into the sector, and more recently the Member States that joined the Union in 2004 and 2007, where we have also opened investigations and are working on several cases.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Yes, I will speak very briefly to simply say that it does not seem to me that there were more disconnections before, when there was a single operator. I can tell Commissioner Almunia that, previously, this operator was responsible. Now that it has been split into two separate entities, when a maintenance problem arises, the two entities – the energy supplier and the network operator – shift the blame by claiming that the other party is responsible for resolving the problem. This is a real pain for consumers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is true that several authorities are responsible for ensuring that European standards aimed at regulating both the electricity sector and competition are applied as intended, in such a way that they have a positive impact on the market. Naturally, the French energy authority imposes these responsibilities on the French market, together with the French competition authority. The Commission, in particular Mr Oettinger, is responsible for enforcing the directive. In this way, several proceedings were initiated, once the Commission realised that the directive – in particular, the third package – had not been applied by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When necessary, investigations will be opened and decisions will be taken under Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty relating to competition, whenever we believe that the Treaty rules are not being applied or that operators are not applying them in this market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How do we work in the field of competition? Sometimes, we undertake investigations on our own initiative. We receive some extremely useful information from users – citizens or companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, if you have information that you believe the competition authorities, the Directorate-General for Competition, or myself, should be aware of because it is likely to lead to the opening of procedures in the area which falls under my responsibility, please pass it on to me.</p>

What we do not want, and are not calling for, is the publication of specific private sector contracts – prices, quantities, terms – unless these infringe internal market law. Then, and only then, will investigations be necessary, as stated by Commissioner Almunia half an hour ago. However, the general publication of private sector contracts is not something we feel is called for.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I have another question. Our main objective is to minimise dependence on third countries and this depends on energy balance. What is your view today of the development of nuclear energy, because this type of energy could be the very best and most effective means of favourably resolving the issue of energy balance compared to third countries, particularly Russia?</p>

    <intervention id="2-137-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">We have various legal bases for our Europeanisation of energy policy. Firstly, as always, there is the primary law of the Euratom Treaty; secondly, there is the Treaty of Lisbon, with its separate section on the Europeanisation of energy legislation; thirdly, there are our general internal market rules that have applied to oil and coal for decades, and that we have been implementing for gas and electricity for 15 years now. On top of that, we have the twenty 2020 goals that are binding energy and climate change policy. There is one thing that we do not have, and that is the decision on the technology. In other words, the issue of nuclear power – yes or no; or coal – if yes, how much and for how long; or renewable energy beyond the binding European target – in other words, more than 20%. All that is a matter for national governments and parliaments. We respect that.</p>
      <p sl="de">In a few weeks’ time, we will submit to you our comprehensive report on our stress tests, containing extensive information on standards, strengths, the risks of the more than 130 nuclear power stations in the EU plus our partners in Ukraine and Switzerland, and which will also provide suggestions as well as requirements for retrofitting and higher standards. We will conduct a debate on that. In the final event, however, the decision will remain a matter for the national governments and parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="de">We currently have around 30% nuclear power in the European electricity mix. According to our investigations, this percentage is likely to fall slightly, but will remain around this level because as well as shutdowns and exit strategies, there are also new nuclear power stations being planned and built. We respect the decision made on this. We have a multicultural Europe: Italy decided in a referendum not to build any nuclear power stations, Germany has decided to phase out nuclear power over ten years, Poland plans two nuclear power stations, the United Kingdom intends to increase the share of nuclear power in the electricity mix from 25% to 60% and France, with President Hollande’s victory in the election, wishes to reduce the share of nuclear power long-term from the current 76% to 50% by 2025.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, I have an important question. If there turns out to be a lot of shale gas, is it to be included in the energy mix? Many countries are making plans to increase their extraction of shale gas. At the same time, many of the Commissioners have asked research centres to carry out a variety of research on questions related to the safety of the technologies used to extract shale gas and the environmental impact of the techniques involved. I would like to know how these research centres are selected, because the results they produce often contradict each other. One centre produces a very positive assessment of shale gas extraction technologies, but another does quite the opposite, and speaks of the very great danger associated with using this kind of technology.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The next question I would like to ask is about the Emissions Trading System. It has not delivered the expected results. We however – the countries of Europe – are still using this system. I would like to know what is going to be done about the ETS.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-139-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Commissioner Hedegaard is responsible within the Commission for matters relating to the Emissions Trading System (ETS). We consider the ETS to be a sensible market economy solution for achieving a reduction in CO2 emissions, and next year we will enter into the control phase. We now have a problem. As a result of the economic stagnation, of the crisis, the CO2 price is no longer around EUR 14-18 as it was for many years, but is now around EUR 6-8. That does not send out a price signal. Consequently, we are considering whether we should take certain CO2 emission rights, certain allowances, off the market for a period in order to achieve a certain increase in the market price. The Commission will make a decision on this in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">The external problem is that CO2 and the ETS have not been recognised or adopted by any other regions of the world. In other words, a world market for CO2 emissions has not yet arisen.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the first topic, that of shale gas: shale gas has completely changed the world market for gas in the US. Whereas previously, the Americans were major importers of gas, of LNG gas, today they are largely self-sufficient in gas energy and have a cost factor: in the US, gas now costs only around 30% of the price of gas in the European markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last week, we presented three studies on the subject of shale gas and its environmental impact and risks. We are working closely together on this: Commissioner Potočnik, Commissioner Hedegaard and I. We are following demonstration projects. We think it is good that demonstration projects are being tried out in a few Member States. At present, we believe that it is too early for further-reaching binding European rules. In general, we believe that shale gas can play a supplementary role in the European gas market, but that it will not replace existing gas entirely. We will continue to need conventional gas from third countries in the long term. Shale gas will have a supplementary function, but will not be a replacement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you for your answer. I would, however, like to know something about the independence of these research centres. I ask this because information received by the committee on which I serve shows that many of the research centres have, in fact, been representatives of specific producers, such as manufacturers of equipment used in the renewable energy industry. It is hard to expect that what they say and the results of their research should be particularly neutral. Therefore, I would like to know if it would not be better if it were research centres from the United States which gave us information on the technologies and methods used in shale gas extraction, and not centres which have a particular interest in promoting particular methods.</p>

      <p sl="de">There are many studies on the subject of shale gas. Certainly, some of these have been commissioned by players in the market and are thus not necessarily completely independent. Our research services are also active. We maintain that the Commission is independent and our experts are able to work uninfluenced by market interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">One further point: renewable energy is not, in fact, an opponent of gas, but a partner for gas. Electricity from solar energy and wind power needs supplementary power generation, and gas is the natural partner. Whether that gas then comes from Russia, Norway or Algeria, or from our own geological formations, is more or less irrelevant to the renewable energy partner.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, part of this issue has already been discussed today. Everything we know about the application of the third package as regards the delay with transposing its directives – the most recent information available to me seems to suggest that 18 Member States have been notified – seems to suggest that this information is probably out of date already because of the lack of transposition. My question is: how likely do you think it is that the legislation being drafted on trans-European transport networks will include a measure, an incentive, laying down conditionality for the presentation of projects of common interest? Will they be conditional on Member States complying with the obligations resulting from the third package or, on the other hand, do you consider such a mechanism extraneous and think all intervention in this area should simply be left to the normal competition mechanisms covered in Article 101 onwards?</p>

I do not believe that, if Member States delay implementing EU law, we should use the European budget as a penalty. We believe that our treaty infringement proceedings are successful and that, in the coming years, we will see all the Member States implementing internal market law in the energy sector on a one-to-one basis.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the current global economic and environmental crisis requires us to make choices to save resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">With the Energy Efficiency Directive adopted today, we can achieve important goals, such as tackling the problem of climate change and the scarcity of fossil fuels, including coal and oil; cutting the annual cost of buying fuel, which amounts to EUR 400 billion, by making a potential saving of EUR 50 billion per year; reducing Europe’s dependency on Russia and OPEC countries, from which we import gas and oil; reducing air pollution, which, in some regions of Europe, currently poses an unfortunately unresolved threat to the health of millions of European citizens; creating new jobs and benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, including installers and the building sector, which is currently going through a very serious crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore welcome the rules introduced for the renovation of public buildings and for four-yearly energy audits, which are compulsory for all large enterprises. This is one of the many steps Europe needs to take. However, we need to do more: we must set ourselves more ambitious targets and take measures that are more binding on all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of Mr Turmes’s report, which paves the way for adoption of a directive that will finally make it possible to overcome the differences between Member States with regard to energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="it">Though it does not change the non-binding nature of the goal of energy efficiency set by the climate and energy package of 2008, the directive imposes on suppliers and distributors compulsory annual saving schemes in terms of final consumption.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to the Commission’s figures, the measure will bring about a total saving of around EUR 20 billion in the costs of investment in energy generation and distribution. This is vitally important and will help reaffirm the Union as a global player, since the future geopolitical balance will be primarily decided by policies on the supply and use of energy resources.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I should like to make a comment on the voting procedure for the minutes. The proceedings have clearly given rise to some confusion as regards the German translation – the rapporteur has also become involved in this – which is contrary to the spirit of the negotiations. The text was negotiated in English. On behalf of the PPE Group, I should therefore like to make it clear that the terms ‘cost effective’ and ‘cost efficient’ are to be used in the sense of the German word ‘kosteneffizient ’. The term used by the language service, ‘kostenwirksam ’, does not correspond to the spirit of the negotiations, nor is it sufficiently clearly defined. We therefore expect that, as in the case of the Buildings Directive, the terms ‘cost effective’ and ‘cost efficient’ will be uniformly translated by ‘kosteneffizient ’. Should this not be the case, we urgently call for this to be changed in the translation. I should like to refer to a letter to the Tabling Office signed by all German-speaking members of the PPE Group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and also the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – in other words, a clear majority of the German-speaking Members. They cannot all have misunderstood it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of this dossier because I believe that the issue of energy efficiency, together with sustainability and competitiveness, can certainly be an essential instrument in a particularly difficult process, such as this one.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need sustainable growth that has to involve small and medium-sized enterprises and that can be used as a virtuous cycle, including through innovative green technology. All this must be achieved through a culture of design that makes the best use of these resources, channelling them towards building refurbishment, which, in particular, requires the full and appropriate use of EU cohesion funds. One third of buildings in Europe were built after 1973, which is clearly significant.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is possible to act within this context, including by means of better training and design that is consistent with the aims of the provision.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, energy efficiency is one of the pillars of EU climate policy. That is why today’s vote is particularly important. It is the result of a satisfactory and timely agreement in terms of the content, in that it obliges the Member States to prepare a strategy based on indicative national targets that take account of EU objectives and, at the same time, enables energy companies to comply with energy saving requirements in accordance with the principle of reasonable flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">The goal of a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 is therefore within reach. I believe that credit is due, above all, to this House, because if the most disruptive Member States within the Council have at last accepted this good compromise, that is due to the tenacity with which Parliament’s negotiators, starting with the rapporteur, safeguarded these goals. This is an important step for the creation of green jobs and, ultimately, to boost competitiveness and sustainability.</p>

In the end, however, I was won over by the conviction that, firstly, it is necessary, and secondly, that our resolution opens up the possibility of putting cost efficiency at the heart of things. It is not about saving energy at any cost, but rather it is, above all, about the whole thing adding up. If it adds up, if we create the necessary framework conditions with as little red tape as possible, then we will have the famous win-win situation in which the economy takes a leap forward and we create new job opportunities in what is known as the green economy. Let me repeat, however, that we need an alliance with the economy so that the whole thing is worthwhile and sensible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, an excellent compromise has been achieved which puts Europe on the right track to achieve the goals of the climate package.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the successes is having maintained the target of 3% in relation to the energy efficiency of public buildings, an ambitious target at a time of economic crisis, which has great environmental value and will act as a lever for the EU’s economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">The directive lays the foundations for redesigning energy saving strategies, for which both private and public operators will need to call on experts in the sector, without whom the established goals will be difficult to achieve. That therefore paves the way for encouraging national training programmes for audit and energy saving experts.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Energy Efficiency Directive had good intentions, but the final outcome is unfair. Once again, the Member States are being treated on an unequal basis, as no attention is being paid to what has already been done. In practice, the countries that have already sorted out their problems properly are being penalised by ever more stringent targets, while the estimated targets are the same, whichever point you start from.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I represent here today the country that is footing the bill for this directive, Finland. Finland is facing a bill of hundreds of millions of euro a year, for both consumers and businesses. Since we are ahead in measures taken to ensure efficiency, continued attempts at efficiency will be even more expensive.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At the risk of sounding cynical, the decision that has now been taken will, in fact, encourage those who have sorted out their problems properly to end their current action to boost energy efficiency and to resume again at the start of 2014. This does not reflect the spirit of good legislation and, for that reason, my country’s parliament also proposed a notification regarding the directive.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For all these reasons, I found it impossible to support this proposal for a directive. I also hope that this House will consider at what point we actually have to resort to the undemocratic first reading agreement short cut procedure.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, in the European Union, we all recognise that efficient consumption of energy contributes to combating climate change and to environmental conservation. However, it is very important that this area brings undoubted benefits for the economy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In order to make our buildings highly energy efficient, new jobs are created and commissions increase in the construction sector. Most importantly, the money saved due to the reduction in energy consumed can be transferred to other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The text of the document proposed by the Commission was rather ambitious – above all, in the sense of binding energy saving targets. I understand that the situation varies across the Member States and perhaps Member States need flexibility as proposed by the European Parliament. However, the so-called compromise that has now been reached with Member States to make these targets simply indicative shows that Member States lack political will or, for other reasons, do not want to adopt common agreements. This is particularly typical of the large European Union Member States.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Often, Member States need a push to achieve certain objectives – that is exactly how binding energy targets could have been set. Unfortunately, so far we are going round in circles.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report as the consumption of energy must be reduced. This has to be done to tackle the challenges and restrict dependency on fossil fuels.</p>
      <p sl="ro">My country has set itself the aim of cutting primary energy consumption by 19% by 2020. However, this is a highly ambitious target, while also being very difficult to achieve. The main thrust of action is aimed at making the system of producing and distributing energy more efficient, as well as informing the public. The Structural Funds have an important contribution to make in this regard, and monitoring progress ensures that the project is implemented correctly and consistently, and meets the specified indicators.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that priority access should continue to be given to renewable energy and investments in this area. Romania is increasingly encouraging this form of energy and intends to continue to promote renewable energy sources by using the green certificates.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, no business needs to be told to look for energy efficiency, nor does any householder need to be told to keep his bills down. There is a wonderful mechanism for driving energy efficiency already and it is called the market. What we are doing in this House when we talk about energy efficiency is precisely the opposite. We are intervening through subsidies and other market distortions, thereby creating not only a financial crisis but an energy crisis, because we are intervening in the natural flow of supply and demand.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why are we doing it? Not in response to an identified crisis but in order to flaunt our virtue. The difficulty, as so often, is that MEPs cannot resist meddling, cannot resist scratching at something in order to show how very concerned they are. I have observed before that Shakespeare has something to say about every subject, including MEPs who cannot help legislating in energy policy: ‘What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, Make yourselves scabs?’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the fact that in looking at the whole debate on climate change and energy production, we are also looking at energy efficiency. Quite often, this is the forgotten element of this whole debate – this wider debate – on climate change and alternative sources of energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do need to incentivise businesses, customers and others towards energy efficiency. That is absolutely right. But, as my colleague said previously, do we need to do this through taxpayer subsidy? Do we need to do it in this way or should we rely on the crucial elements of the market which will drive people naturally towards this? We should be encouraging insulation, smart metering and regeneration technologies but, at the same time, we should not meddle where it causes more problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is telling the British Government that it has to increase its VAT on insulation products. So, while on the one hand we are discussing energy efficiency and claiming that we are promoting energy efficiency, by what we actually do through taxation policy we are reducing the incentives for energy efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, cooperation and coordination in energy efficiency policies could actually bring added value, provided they are not binding on the Member States. But this is an area where you could bring financial savings to the consumer by making things cheaper. I agree with Mr Hannan that the market is important.</p>
      <p sl="en">There would be less environmental pollution, with the emission of certain toxic noxious gases, if the power stations could be more efficient. There could also be fewer greenhouse gas emissions, but I also think that there is a danger sometimes of being over-reactive, as with the abolition of the incandescent light bulb. The imposition of mandatory CFL light bulbs is something that irritated me no end. They cannot be dimmed, so you cannot make them more efficient. They give off UV light, which potentially causes cancer in people with certain conditions of the skin, and they release toxic mercury into the environment. This was like using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut, because you could have actually used the market – made them cheap and available – and people would therefore have switched to them on a voluntary basis. But to make it mandatory was something that made the EU very unpopular in my constituency of London.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, apologies – I had mixed up two cards. More than a decade has passed since the terrorist attack on New York in 2001, which triggered the war against international terrorism. The CIA’s programme of secrecy has meant that more than 3 000 terror suspects have been abducted and, on the grounds of extraordinary rendition, flown to secret prisons, often to be tortured.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Unfortunately, however, we in Europe are just as guilty. It is a contradiction that, while the European Union heavily criticises the United States for its secret transportation of prisoners by air, for the prison camps at Guantánamo, and for the brutal interrogation practices employed with terror suspects, it has been unwilling to investigate its own role in this. This is by no means a trivial matter.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report also calls on Finland to disclose all necessary information on all suspect planes associated with the CIA and its air transportation programme. I doubt if any very murky secrets about CIA flights would be found in the archives of the EU countries. I do, however, wonder greatly why Europe lacks the will to clean up its own back yard.</p>

Asylum seekers enter Europe not only by sea, and second-line countries – where their final destination is – should also be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just like to take an example. In Sweden, we are now receiving a thousand people from Syria every week and, of course, we feel enormous solidarity towards them.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one of the constant criticisms we have of EU policies is that, whatever the problem, the solution always tends to be more Europe. When we look at an issue, such as the highly emotive one of asylum, an issue where people facing persecution seek refuge in our lands, why are we playing politics and continuing this one-size-fits-all idea and playing with people’s lives?</p>
      <p sl="en">We should look at and understand the individual policies of individual governments. Governments themselves and local communities have to consider the impact of new people coming into the country on existing community cohesion, including the impact on existing immigrant communities. So, when the UK Government, or any other elected government, says that it has a policy and that it has decided on what is a sustainable number of people to allow in, considering the impact on local communities, it should be allowed to continue that policy and should certainly not be told by the EU, or any other body, that it should allow more room. We should depend on the wise decisions of the national elected governments.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this regulation is the result of the resolution adopted by Parliament two years ago on the future of European standardisation. It underscores the role of standards as the driving force of innovation, and also their role in ensuring that the single market provides a high level of consumer protection. An important feature is the inclusion of a number of significant amendments which make it possible to enhance the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in standardisation work. Furthermore, increasing the participation of national public authorities and societal stakeholders, including consumers’ organisations, will facilitate the standards development process and improve the clarity of standards. The inclusion of service standards in the legal framework of European standardisation will contribute to a significant improvement in the quality and security of this sector of the economy, and will also contribute to its harmonisation, transparency and competitiveness, with clear benefits for consumers.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we have approved an important step towards the completion of the single market. This is the most effective way to promote growth in Europe at a time of economic crisis, so we should not underestimate the importance of this legislation. Although technical, it is crucial for our companies and consumers in their daily lives. In a rapidly changing world, standards must ensure interoperability and keep pace with technological developments. We also need to have effective tools to drive innovation and boost the competitiveness of European companies in global markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore welcome the fact that standards will continue to be bottom-up, market driven and voluntary. We have adopted a framework that will help develop European standards.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, just before the vote, my friend and colleague, Chris Davies, said that I had to read Niall Ferguson’s book ‘Civilisations’. It is actually a book I had already read, and the thesis in it is not especially new. The idea that Europe flourished because it was a diverse, competing plurality of states rather than a single empire on the oriental model has been well-rehearsed by historians, by Alan Macfarlane, by Paul Kennedy, by Eric Jones, indeed by Adam Smith. It is a pretty old theory. Or, if you think I am being too Anglocentric about this, also by Montesquieu and Tocqueville, both of whom understood that the stasis inherent in uniformity, as it existed in the great ancient monarchies, is bad for growth and bad ultimately, therefore, for living standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I am sure you can tell where I am going with this argument. In trying to get on top of wars, the founders of the European Union also smothered the competition, the diversity, that had been the basis of the greatness of European civilisation. Our generation is living through a tragic reversal whereby just as China and India learned the virtues of the dispersal of power, Europe is going down this Ming, Mogul, and Ottoman road towards uniformity, taxation and decline. Our mistake and our tragedy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is important, when we look at the idea of standards, that we understand what we are trying to achieve. Of course it is often good for the consumer, and often good for industry, to be able to have the certainty to produce the standards that others can work towards. But with standards, there is also the other side of the issue: What does it do to innovation? How do we come up with those standards? We have to be wary of those who lobby loudest for their particular standards in order to stifle the competition and to crowd others out of the marketplace. We have to be careful of the rent-seeking behind this.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to be careful that we are not so keen on our own standards that, when it comes to global agreements and trade practices, one man’s standard becomes another’s non-tariff barrier or technical barrier. Surely the best way for most of these products to be developed is to allow the market to provide the standards and then allow the best standards to win out. Then the bodies can agree after negotiation on the best standard, rather than imposing it too early and crowding out the players that you do not want to flourish.</p>

In particular, they seek to meet the need for an automatic, urgent EU-wide procedure in cases where a Member State or the Commission considers that serious adverse side effects have occurred and therefore, there is a need to prohibit the supply of a particular medicine. They also seek to clarify the transparency obligations on pharmaceutical companies, namely, that companies are obliged to inform the European Medicines Agency, which is a very successful agency based in my own region of London, when a medicinal product is deemed to be harmful and this agency is then, in turn, obliged to inform all Member States without undue delay.

      <p sl="fi">I could have cast my vote for or against, but this time the disastrous consequences of emission limits for Finnish industry carried more weight. The directive also treats the Member States of the EU unequally and distorts competition in the internal market. The rules on transition with respect to emission limits should be the same for all the sea areas of Europe and, for that reason, I voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I voted against this report. Obviously, we all think that the environment must be looked after and that sulphur limits should be lowered. However, this must take place in all European sea areas at one and the same time, and preferably globally, of course. At present, it only concerns the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We know about the problems of the Baltic Sea, and we know that eutrophication is a huge problem there. It is not actually due to sulphur now, but, of course, this decision will result in a dramatic weakening of the competitiveness of Finnish industry. This will distort competition within the European Union. That is why I would have liked the scope of this directive to extend to the whole of Europe at the same time, and so the deferment until 2020 would have been good, because it is not fair from the perspective of the internal market either that some countries should pay far more for their exports than others. In this sense, fairness could be achieved by including the whole of the European Union within the scope of the Sulphur Directive at one and the same time.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As has already been said, this will mean a bill to Finnish industry of more than EUR 800 million a year. Finland is an economy that is dependent on exports, and, in this respect, I would have liked the scope of this directive to extend to the whole of the European Union at the same time. For that reason, I voted against it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report because it will allow us to gain important benefits for both our health and the environment. Air quality standards can be achieved by reducing sulphur emissions from ships. Restricting atmospheric pollution could also help prevent tens of thousands of premature deaths every year. Maritime transport has a significant impact on air quality and can help provide an effective solution to the problems relating to pollution.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The benefits to public health will greatly outweigh the estimated costs. The directive will also help ensure a level playing field in terms of competition and foster innovation and resource efficiency. I should stress that reducing marine emissions will also provide great economic benefit.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, while acknowledging the efforts of the rapporteur to take a balanced line, the ALDE Group felt obliged to abstain in the final vote today due to conservative and religious views dominating the final report to the detriment of patients who face shortages of tissues and cells in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Currently, in many Member States, there are too few donors and too many people waiting for tissues and cells, particularly spinal marrow, gametes, cornea and skin. This report was an ideal opportunity to address this serious health problem, but the focus on other issues means it has sadly fallen short in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">A number of provisions were adopted today that threaten the already insufficient supply of tissues and cells in many Member States, including calling on Member Sates to require that donors be anonymous except in the case of a donation from a living person to a relative, thus potentially preventing, for example, an EU citizen from choosing to donate to a friend in need. The ALDE Group does not see the need to further restrict donation rules when we have shortages of tissues and cells in over half the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another point was calling on Member States to promote only public cord blood banks, thus ignoring the existence of well regulated private cord blood banks in some Member States, awareness of which should also be promoted in the interests of promoting the donation of cord blood for the benefit of patients.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the call for European standards and requirements for private stem cell banks but not for public cell banks, the ALDE Group believes that all stem cell banks should be required to meet the same high standards of safety and quality and that imposing higher standards only on private banks could further hinder access to much-needed tissues and cells. Calling for the Commission to revise Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 to guarantee the application of the principle of unpaid donation, the ALDE Group believes that in order to avoid undermining the quality and safety of donated tissues and cells, it is vital to encourage various models of donation developed by both public and private sectors and to ensure reasonable reimbursement of donors. This vote does not send the right message to scientists or patients.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, having in mind the more than 60 000 people awaiting transplants and the 10 people, on average, who die every day because they have not managed to get an organ, I voted for this report. I believe that the initiative being put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), supported by the work of Ms Yannakoudakis, is more relevant than ever.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the very difficult times we are currently experiencing both in Europe and worldwide, many desperate people are fuelling the deplorable practice of the commercialisation of organs. We increasingly hear reports of European citizens who, in order to cope with the serious problems of everyday life, put their own organs up for sale on the Internet or through other channels.</p>
      <p sl="it">Through this report, the European Union is setting out to combat an extremely difficult situation, a sort of unsustainable Wild West. Once again, we are saying ‘enough’ – because, unfortunately, the laws making this trade illegal are not sufficient – once again, we are saying ‘enough’ to trafficking in organs and the illegal market and instead, we are seeking to promote life and health among citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a doctor, I am particularly enthusiastic about the proposals to break down the barriers to sharing donor registries across the European Union, which will, of course, contribute to the fight against cancer and other life-threatening diseases. I am also pleased with the emphasis placed by the rapporteur – who happens to be my London colleague Marina Yannakoudakis – on the ethics of donation, taking the view that the human body should not be a source of financial gain. The report thus rightly rejects the practice of an open market for tissues and cells, but importantly, it goes on to stress that donors across the Union deserve fair and reasonable compensation for their efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also emphasis on the requirement for greater traceability and transparency in the donation process across the EU. The report equally encourages Member States to build on existing examples of best practice in those countries, for example, the renowned cord blood collection scheme in the UK run by NHS Blood and Transplant and the famous Anthony Nolan Trust. I am also pleased to say that the final report crucially resisted calls for a ban on private storage clinics anywhere in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I abstained from voting on this report, even though I think it is important and marks progress compared to the old directive. However, I do not believe that it offers the best solutions. The report takes a unilateral approach based on a certain type of ethics which advocates donation. However, for religious reasons and from a perspective which I would consider deeply religious, these ethics are not compatible with valuing human life.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the discriminatory schemes which it introduces and the double standards with regard to private and public donation schemes are not right and tend, in actual fact, to hamper the purpose of this directive, which means the attempt by some of us to save other human lives with their organs. I believe that identical standards were required for both state and private schemes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that unpaid donations must be favoured, but we cannot discourage either these donations made in return for payment when this does not affect the moral good and the principles of good. I also believe that we need to encourage the concepts of presumed consent, with Member States being free to try different options, and we should not impose a standard option on Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to take the floor to present the voting option for this report for which I was shadow rapporteur. I would like to highlight two points. Apart from this being a subject which did not add very many new insights to this own-initiative report, I believe that it contains several recommendations which I feel are extremely important in terms of the option we have to involve women in the green economy, which is a hypothetical one because, unfortunately, the green economy is not the norm, nor is the presence of women in this economy the norm either.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the appeal to the Commission to promote gender equality in the rules for accessing European funds, the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund is, in my view, one of the solutions for promoting women in this kind of economy. Ongoing professional training along with an environmental aspect would also provide the second solution. Lastly, the gender aspect when implementing European directives ought to be taken into account when Member States are implementing this option in their own legislation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report because I think that the transition to a green economy is one of the EU’s main objectives. Unfortunately, the way in which this transition is achieved fails to take into account the gender aspect. Adapting environmental policies to the gender aspect must take into account the fact that women generally develop a more environmentally friendly attitude. There must also be some recognition that women and men have unequal access to certain resources. I believe that we need to improve how women access the business technologies needed to gain high-skilled jobs in the green economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">All the programmes and projects launched should feature indicators to assess their gender-specific impact. I call on the Commission and Member States to devise such indicators.</p>

What nonsense. I do not see women abandoned on the streets of Strasbourg, forsaken by men-only buses and trams. Perhaps the rapporteur thinks that women need improved transport because, according to the report, women do not affect the environment in the same way as men. Again, what nonsense.</p>

      <p sl="it">This report analyses, in particular, the gap between the two genders in the tertiary sector and takes a step forward which I believe is important and which convinced me to vote for the report.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I, too, supported this report, but for completely different reasons to my colleague. I feel that this is one of the serious analyses of the gender inequality which persists on the labour market, and specifically in the services market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Women are employed in 10% of the 130 professions considered accessible to everyone on the labour market, generally in those with low qualifications, which I feel sounds an alarm bell in terms of access and creating a certain type of poverty among women in the labour market. I also consider it significant that the wage gaps which persist in this sector are highlighted.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, what is certain, apart from these observations, is that not only the solutions advocated in the report, but also those advocated in the Commission’s options are not the ones to provide a response in terms of solving this problem.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU likes to claim that it is a fort for progress in relation to women’s rights. However, it is EU-led austerity programmes and neoliberal policies that are disproportionately increasing hardship for women workers. These programmes are resulting in mass job losses, together with attacks on wages and conditions in the service sector, particularly in retail. A majority of the unemployed workers in the EU are now women. Women are also disproportionately hit by savage budget cuts, targeting vital public services and social welfare. We have seen this in Ireland with the scandalous cuts to single parent allowances, to home helps and the threatened cuts to child benefit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Women workers in the service sector have been one of the most active sections of workers taking action against redundancies and attacks on their conditions. In Ireland, we have seen this with the recent strikes and occupations in La Senza, Thomas Cook, EBS and Laura Ashley. The trade union movement must now organise in the service sector to fight against low pay and job losses, and for decent working conditions with improved maternity and paternity leave and decent public services.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report states that gender stereotypes are impeding women from realising their full potential. It is possible for women to be CEOs, brain surgeons, concert pianists and even MEPs. It is also possible for women to stay at home and raise a family, perhaps picking up a part-time job in the service sector along the way. This report looks down its nose at the service industry and insults all the women and men who work in this sector. This report also suggests that women are treated differently by employers because they are more likely to interrupt their careers in order to have children. Well, regrettably, this may be true to an extent. If it is true, though, why does the rapporteur call for the Council to unblock the Maternity Leave Directive? Twenty weeks’ fully paid compulsory leave will reduce young women’s chances of getting a job.</p>

These situations jeopardise the European public’s social and economic well-being, and we should take that into account. The EGF does not just use compensatory measures to adapt our economy to the global economy, but, above all, it protects citizens and businesses in difficulties, which should be taken into account in times of crisis.

It is thus suspect that while with one hand, Brussels continues to undermine and weaken national economies through flawed single currency policy, they are, with the other, willing to provide hand outs to those stricken by its effects. It should be the priority and prerogative of national governments, with the optional aid of sympathetic third countries, to deal with the major structural challenges many countries are currently facing in the wake of the global financial crisis. To continue to endorse the mobilisation of the Adjustment Fund is to permit the perpetuation of Brussels undermining national economies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I support the way the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has been mobilised to help the workers made redundant from Odense Steel Shipyard in Denmark. This is the fourth mobilisation of the EGF in 2012. In recent decades, the European shipbuilding industry has been losing a significant amount of market share to Asia. This sector is being rocked by the global economic and financial crisis, and has seen the number of people employed there decline by 23% over the last three years. I also regret that Denmark is one of the countries compromising negotiations on the EGF after 2013, since it has applied for mobilisation of the fund several times. Finally, I would re-emphasise that the EGF was born out of a 2005 Commission communication: European values in a globalised world . It was against that backdrop that President Barroso sent a letter to the EU Heads of State or Government and to Parliament, proposing the creation of the EGF. Seven years later, the effects of the crisis are not just still with us, but are getting worse, which clearly demonstrates the importance of a Europe of solidarity and with effective resource redistribution between Member States. It is a shame that these examples are not replicated in other European mechanisms.</p>

The global market for shipbuilding is one of the main areas that has been hit hard by the crisis. It declined by 20% between 2008 and 2009. European shipbuilders have, for several years, had to face increasingly strong competition from Asia in particular. Therefore, the European Union will mobilise EUR 6.5 million to help 550 Danish shipyard workers who have been made redundant.

      <p sl="pt">The annual report of the Community of European Shipyards’ Associations shows that labour in Europe’s shipbuilding industry has declined by 23% in the last three years. This is the result of capitalist globalisation and the policies that have been supporting it, imposing competition between workers and the general devaluation of the workforce. More and more people are being made redundant as the social and economic crisis deepens, particularly, but not exclusively, in productive sectors. That is why we still advocate extending the ‘crisis derogation’, which increased the rate of EU cofinancing to 65%.</p>

Pursuant to Article 6 of the EGF Regulation, EGF money should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment. EGF assistance can only cofinance active labour market measures which lead to long-term employment. Assistance from the EGF must not replace either actions, which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, or measures restructuring companies or sectors. The industrial structure of the local economy is characterised by a high share of employment in manufacturing, particularly in metallurgy. Many jobs in this industry have already been lost to other countries with lower wages. The shipyard workers being dismissed have great technical expertise, which is difficult to apply in other industries in Funen or even across Denmark. Many of them have worked in the shipyard all their lives and their parents may have worked there too. I therefore welcome the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Danish authorities decided to embark on implementation of the measures ahead of the final decision on granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package.</p>

The targeted financial support which it provides under retraining and reintegration programmes for workers hit by mass redundancies is especially important. Furthermore, the support which it provides is a real expression of EU solidarity. Finally, the case of Denmark illustrates in the best possible way that this financing instrument is not limited to countries facing economic and budgetary challenges and can be equally useful in helping to reintegrate people made redundant into the labour market even in economically robust countries.

This support will be mobilised for 836 workers made redundant in the Aragón region of Spain. There is a decline in demand for construction in Spain: the number of building permits granted in Spain decreased by 75.6% in 2009 and 82.8% in 2010 compared with 2007. The aim of the fund is to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant due to the global economic crisis.

      <p sl="ro">In Spain, the construction industry has been particularly severely affected by the crisis, and the loans granted to this sector have decreased sharply. There has also been a fall in demand for new houses due to a lack of consumer confidence and liquidity. Indeed, there has also been a huge rise in unemployment. Against this background, I believe that the fund needs to be further mobilised to tackle the decline facing the sector.</p>

As we are currently facing a serious financial, economic and social crisis, one of the most important consequences of which has been increased unemployment, the EU must respond using all means available to it, particularly as regards supporting people who are out of work. That is why I voted for this report concerning the mobilisation of EUR 13 000 000 from the EGF for Spain, with the aim of supporting the 320 eligible workers out of the 836 made redundant by 377 enterprises operating in the construction sector in the region of Aragón.</p>

      <p sl="en">I regret that in Spain, 528 workers have been made redundant by 323 construction firms. Redundancy is challenging for any individual and their family, and rising unemployment is changing the face of society in Spain and breeding levels of poverty that are totally unacceptable in 21st century Europe. Yet it is EU fiscal policy, including austerity demands and the inept handling of the euro crisis, that is part-author of this script. It is thus suspect that while, on the one hand, Brussels continues to undermine and weaken the Spanish economy through flawed single currency policy, it is, on the other hand, willing to provide hand-outs to those stricken by its effects. In essence, policy making in Brussels is crushing domestic ability to provide pastoral care for its peoples, in terms of jobs, social provisions and welfare, yet allows the EU to step in to subsume these roles. It should be the priority and prerogative of national governments, with the optional aid of sympathetic third countries, to deal with the major structural challenges many countries are currently facing in the wake of the global financial crisis. To continue to endorse the mobilisation of the Adjustment Fund is to permit the perpetuation of Brussels’ undermining of national economies.</p>

As the Commission acknowledges in its plan to relaunch the European economy, the crisis has caused an abrupt decline in the construction sector, and there is clearly a positive correlation between increased numbers of redundancies and changes in the patterns of world trade. I therefore voted to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the region of Aragón, Spain. However, I would re-emphasise that mobilising funds via the EGF cannot replace measures that are the responsibility of firms under national legislation or collective bargaining agreements, and that, since they are aimed at helping workers, these funds should not be allocated to restructuring companies or sectors of economic activity.</p>

The previous occasions related to supporting the motor-vehicle and retail sectors, and their stated aim was to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the global economic and financial crisis. It should be noted that unemployment has risen sharply in Aragón and that, at the end of 2011, the number of people registered for state unemployment benefit was around 100 000. A tormented region in a country being savaged by the austerity decreed by the centres of power of an EU whose policies do nothing more than pile crisis on crisis and unemployment on unemployment. In this context, we can once again only lament the Council’s decision not to extend the ‘crisis derogation’, which increased the EU cofinancing rate to 65%. This means that the countries with the greatest economic and social difficulties – those where the most companies have gone bankrupt and where there is the most unemployment – are those that will least be able to make use of the EGF. We continue to advocate increased cofinancing for the EGF, particularly for countries in a fragile economic state such as Portugal, in order to ensure that the national contribution does not exceed 5% of the total funds provided for.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), in accordance with application EGF/2011/017 ES/Aragón Construction from Spain. The Commission has already recognised in its Economic Recovery Plan that the construction industry in the EU had seen demand plummet as a result of the crisis. Available data confirms the significant downturn in the construction sector, which fell in the EU27 for eight consecutive quarters from the start of 2009, compared with the same period of the previous year, mainly due to the decrease in private investment in the residential sector. In 2009, construction output in Spain followed the same negative trend as the EU27 average. However, in 2010 and the first half of 2011, the downturn in the Spanish construction sector was further exacerbated. Due to the low population density in most of the territory concerned by this application and the risk of depopulation, layoffs have a highly negative impact on this region and might jeopardise the efforts made to encourage the population to remain in this region. Furthermore, the EGF has already intervened in five cases of dismissals in the construction sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this proposal. The Commission concluded that the application meets the conditions for deploying the EGF. One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis. Spanish authorities argue that the construction sector has been severely affected by the crisis. Loans to the construction sector and to individuals have been drastically reduced and the demand for new houses has decreased due to declining consumer confidence and the lack of liquidity. The Commission has recognised in its Economic Recovery Plan that the construction industry in the EU had seen demand plummet as a result of the crisis. The arguments presented in previous cases concerning the construction of buildings sector, and in which the redundancies were a direct result of the crisis, remain valid. The territory concerned by the redundancies is the autonomous community of Aragón.</p>

This trend is in line with the falling demand for new construction that exists throughout Europe, but the condition of the housing market has degraded at an even more rapid pace in Spain. A mobilisation of the EGF for an amount of EUR 1 300 000 will allow workers that had been employed in construction to diversify their skills, which will alleviate some of the burden of unemployment in Aragón.

In December 2011, Spain applied for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in order to address this situation and to help workers who had been made redundant by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in this sector in Aragón to find work.

This situation, in conjunction with the problems faced by the automotive sector in that region, has made Aragón one of the most economically fragile regions in Spain. The adverse impact of globalisation, in conjunction with the economic crisis that continues to grip Spain, illustrates even more the added value of the EGF as an instrument of EU social policy. The targeted financial support which it provides under retraining and reintegration programmes for workers hit by mass redundancies is especially important. Furthermore, the support which it provides is a real expression of EU solidarity. The Spanish regions are in the process of rationalisation and drastic cutbacks.

By the end of 2011, the number of workers registered in the public labour offices was close to 100 000, of which 15% were workers made redundant in the construction sector. In addition to this, Aragón had been hit hard in the past by mass dismissals. Europe’s role is to support, where possible, the victims of the crisis, of whom there are still too many.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) with the aim of supporting workers who have lost their jobs due to structural changes in the context of the global economy. Spain has submitted a request for mobilisation of the EGF for 836 workers made redundant, 320 of whom are eligible, from 377 enterprises in the building construction sector in the Spanish region of Aragón. I support the mobilisation of EUR 1 300 000, in order to help the reintegration of these workers into the labour market. In particular, I support measures for vocational training which seek to create high-added value jobs within the footwear sector, thereby avoiding the loss of acquired expertise in this sector. It is also important to stress that the EGF should not be a substitute for the legal and financial responsibilities of the Spanish firms, but rather an additional support granted by the EU in order to mitigate the social difficulties that these workers will face.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Commission has recognised in its Economic Recovery Plan that the construction industry in the EU had seen demand plummet as a result of the economic and financial crisis. The number of building permits granted in Spain decreased by 75.6% in 2009 and by 82.8% in 2010 compared with 2007, while the number of buildings started decreased by 52.2% in 2009 compared with 2008 and by 76.7% compared with 2007.

      <p sl="pl">There is no doubt that the crisis has done great harm to the construction sector in the European Union. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide additional support to workers made redundant as a direct result of the crisis. EGF support should be allocated primarily to training and job search activities as well as to training programmes. It should not be used to improve unemployment benefits. However, in the coordinated package prepared by Spain, this is precisely the nature of the financial incentives to be offered to encourage participation. Unemployment benefits are the responsibility of national, not EU institutions. I therefore voted against the report.</p>

Ever since the fund was set up in 2006, we have always abstained from voting because we were opposed to the fund from the outset, as we do not believe that this fund is the right instrument to use to help workers affected by structural changes. The fund has now grown, developed and has its own impact. It exists and it is not going to disappear in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we will now adopt a position in each individual case in relation to whether they meet the very strict requirements made of the applicants with regard to cofinancing and long-term employment measures. In both of these cases, we believe that the applications meet these requirements. Within the framework of the work on the 2013 budget and the long-term budget, we will continue to support more effective and longer-term instruments to increase employment, cope with structural changes and increase flexibility on the labour market.</p>

While some of the applications to this fund may be worthy, more could be achieved if this money were returned to the Member States. The process for this fund is too bureaucratic. A company has to submit an application to the national government, which then, in turn, applies to the Commission, which judges whether the application is worthy or not. If it is deemed worthy, the Commission submits the application to the budgetary authority, and then finally we are required to vote on something we are far, far removed from.

      <p sl="ro">The EU has set ambitious standards in terms of energy efficiency. However, according to the assessments made, the extraordinary potential for energy savings and efficiency is not sufficiently utilised. The measures already adopted by Member States have proven to be inadequate in terms of removing the obstacles still hampering the market and regulation. This is why the Energy Efficiency Directive is so important, because it establishes a common framework for promoting energy efficiency in the EU by 2020 and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to commend, in particular, the provisions on the long-term building renovation strategy and those on the funding schemes for energy efficiency measures.

I supported this text, the main measures of which are to insulate public buildings, carry out energy audits and mobilise funds to facilitate this transition.

We therefore need to take all the measures necessary to enable us to promote efficient and sustainable energy use and contribute to guaranteeing energy security and reducing energy dependence on third countries. I welcome the directive’s binding targets at EU and national level to achieve a 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, which would help improve not just the Union’s energy security, but would also contribute to the EU’s economic recovery. I agree that energy saving systems should be established in the Member States to achieve energy efficiency and public bodies should be obliged to purchase energy-efficient buildings.

      <p sl="nl">With this new directive, we are taking a big step forwards in terms of achieving the Europe 2020 climate targets. This is not only good in terms of further reducing CO2 emissions; investments in energy efficiency will also promote jobs and energy costs for businesses and consumers will decrease. By providing better information on the energy bill and through initiatives undertaken by energy suppliers to save 1.5% in energy each year, we will all be encouraged to consume energy in a more conscious way.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Member States should set the example. Every year, 3% of central government buildings will need to be renovated in order to make them more energy efficient. This will undoubtedly provide an impetus for employment. The long-term strategies for the renovation of residential and commercial buildings which Member States need to draw up will undoubtedly contribute to this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Admittedly, this Energy Efficiency Directive could have been more ambitious. It is a compromise and there is certainly still work to be done. However, it is clear that we are on the right track in order to ensure a better environment, more jobs and reduced energy dependence.</p>

There are exemptions of course, and some measures are still voluntary, but even so, the agreement reached at first reading enables us to turn certain elements of the Energy Efficiency Plan into binding measures. Energy companies will have to reduce their sales to industrial and domestic consumers by at least 1.5% per year. Each Member State will have to ensure that 3% of the floor area of government buildings is renovated every year, in accordance with the directive on the energy performance of buildings. Finally, EU countries will have to submit an action plan at regular intervals. While Parliament would have liked to go further on these issues, we should remember that it is the Council and therefore the Member States that have made this text less ambitious.

I welcome all measures intended to increase energy efficiency, save resources and reduce this high level of dependence. Support for enterprises in the EU which produce energy is fully justified because it helps increase Europe’s competitiveness in the world, and inside the EU it helps develop this and other branches of the economy and creates jobs. In view of steadily rising energy prices, it is in the interests of European consumers to ensure that these costs are kept under control. The objective stated in the directive of achieving an absolute reduction in energy consumption must therefore be incorporated in strategies for the management of energy.

      <p sl="ro">Another important aspect is the situation regarding residential and industrial buildings which account for more than 40% of primary energy consumption in Europe. Increasing energy efficiency in buildings is an absolute must in order to achieve the important environmental protection targets, on the one hand, and to reduce the ever rising energy costs for the users of the buildings, on the other. This is why I think that the policies and measures adopted must result in a complete reduction in energy consumption, which will lead to a decrease in the overall cost of energy for consumers, thereby freeing up income for the EU’s citizens and businesses and cutting public sector expenditure.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the main objective of EU environmental policy is to reduce the amount of dangerous and harmful gas emissions and other emissions. Promoting energy efficiency is the best means of doing this. Energy efficiency may help to bring costs for efficient products and services down and increase the business opportunities for the industries involved. The decision adopted by the Heads of State in 2007 set the target of increasing energy efficiency by 20% and this is a key element of the 2050 Low Carbon Road map. In order to achieve this target, the Member States should deliver national action plans, which are decisive and specific, and the Commission must have the right to assess and amend them. A European methodology should also be laid down based on a model allowing the different situation in the Member States to be assessed. A correction factor linked to the economic situation of the country should also be applied to avoid a situation where the model is difficult to implement for some countries and not decisive enough for others. It is worth mentioning that the objective of energy efficiency is not only inseparable from the regulation of the activities of every citizen and SME, but from the provision of incentives, such as the creation of an energy saving support system. However, national incentives need to be clearly defined so that they are not seen as illegal State aid.</p>

Therefore, it is an excellent idea to make legislative thinking, individual incentives, the promotion of competition and excellence in the construction and facilities industries all converge on the aim of efficient buildings.</p>
      <p sl="it">Promoting a redevelopment of significant proportions of the building stock, both private and public, through the involvement of and support for economic forces and enterprise, a concrete commitment on the part of the public authorities and the participation of families, produces many results: in environmental terms, it contributes to achieving the targets as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy; it could be a factor helping to revitalise our economies, because it is based on values of know-how and the quality of enterprises; it helps families and consumers, affected by the pervasive and knock-on effects of the fuel price rises or increases in tax on resources; it promotes research and development, without indulging in attractive but dangerous utopias of negative growth; it contributes to security and stability, easing energy dependence on supplies that are located, for the most part, in politically volatile areas.</p>

These new measures aim to make additional savings and, at the same time, highlight the need for energy efficiency. Binding measures have thus been drawn up to get Member States more closely involved: cost-effective approaches to building renovations are required, and energy efficiency should become a key factor when awarding contracts.

      <p sl="pl">The report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC contains an analysis of several key questions which are going to decide the future of Europe. The EU faces the huge challenge of its growing demand for electricity, among other reasons, because of the way the new Member States are developing. According to the International Energy Agency, in 15 years, Poland will need 50% more energy that it is currently able to produce. Rigorous EU standards on CO2 emissions and the need to implement renewable energy technologies make it difficult to produce energy in such amounts.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe also faces the challenge of increasing its energy efficiency by 20% by the end of 2020 (conclusions of the European Council of 4 February 2011). Unfortunately, achievement of this objective is not made easy by numerous internal and external factors, including the economic crisis and the competition facing Europe on every side in the field of transport or heavy industry. We currently face a challenge which is forcing us to grow faster while doing less damage to the environment, which is not easy to do. Outdated infrastructure and technologies are causing huge losses and contributing to high levels of emissions, but to change this situation, it is necessary to invest. Apart from this, consideration should also be given to creating instruments which would help the citizens reduce their energy consumption.</p>

      <p sl="en">The proposals lean towards increasingly centralised and punitive measures that would essentially burden the taxpayer, indirectly and directly, to fund energy efficiency targets stipulated by the EU. While energy efficiency is paramount in the light of decreasing resources and increasing fuel prices, with energy deficit seeing many European countries depend upon fuel importation that undermines and weakens national economies, creating a pan-European policy is only likely to backfire and see the burden of cost passed onto the public via legislation that fails to appreciate and accommodate specifics of particular industries or regions. Costs enforced upon utility companies will simply be passed down to the consumer, as will the results from energy audits on large enterprises if not handled effectively. While the rapporteur acknowledges the need to protect consumers against unjustified price rises, and the role of local governance in actuating energy efficiency, these principles stand in direct contradiction to the proposition of centralised targets and to the identification that ‘levies or obligations on all customers or retailers can raise substantial and constant funding’. I would not trust Brussels to forge a centralised energy efficiency strategy that would avoid deep and divisive consequences.</p>

The main benefits will include lower CO2 emissions and a resulting reduction in waste, and investment and innovations designed to achieve the targets will be encouraged.

In our view, there will thus have to be an increased commitment to ensuring that long-term perspectives and requirements find a way to establish themselves in the face of the selfish interests which, in the short-term, can have a strong influence on Member States’ governments and, in particular, at a time of acute economic crisis. A structural and lasting solution to this crisis must instead be sought in measures that address and solve the roots of the serious issue of energy poverty.

      <p sl="fr">The European Union has set itself the target of reducing its carbon emissions and energy consumption by 20% by 2020. In order to achieve this target, it is essential that concrete measures are implemented, such as renovating public buildings, developing energy saving programmes or enforcing regular compulsory energy audits for large companies. If these measures are properly implemented, the European Union will achieve savings of EUR 50 billion each year. Increased energy efficiency will not only enable us to protect the environment, but it will also help to boost the economy and create new jobs by stimulating the research and innovation sectors.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On Tuesday, a very large majority voted in favour of a directive that should enable Europe to improve its energy efficiency by roughly 15% between now and the end of the decade. The stakes were high. The text, which should be transposed into the law of the Member States by early 2014 at the latest, forces Member States to renovate 3% of public buildings each year, with a view to increasing their energy efficiency. It is worth noting, however, that as a result of pressure from several countries, and given the current state of public finances in Europe, local and regional administrative buildings – which represent 12% of offices in Europe – will not be subject to this requirement. On the other hand, European energy suppliers will have to take measures to reduce their customers’ energy consumption by 1.5% each year between 2014 and 2020. The directive also forces Member States to adopt national energy efficiency plans, which will be submitted to the Commission. If these plans are not sufficiently ambitious, then the Commission will be able to impose binding measures on them from 2014.</p>

It is vital that new investments in energy efficiency are economically sustainable and do not give rise to undesirable spin-offs, such as increasing energy costs for end consumers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, I think that it is important for these investments also to cover the private housing sector as in many Member States, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, this causes huge energy losses.

The objective is to increase energy efficiency in the EU by 20%, which will lead to a saving of 368 million tonnes of oil equivalent against the trend by 2020. I believe the EU cannot fail to hit its energy efficiency target: if it does, it will also fail as regards climate change, energy security, environmentally friendly growth and social protection. The renovation, every year, of 3% of the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings owned by the state or occupied by the central government, as well as the installation of smart meters that help consumers to improve their behaviour as regards energy efficiency, are some examples of things this directive aims to introduce with a view to increasing energy efficiency.

      <p sl="pt">We argue that it is imperative to take significant steps to increase energy efficiency and, in general, to rationalise energy consumption. This requires profound changes to take hold, first and foremost, by changing the dominant economic model at international level. Continuing with the same principles that have been guiding EU energy policy, such as liberalising the energy markets, will not have the desired effect. The goal in the so-called ‘market economy’ is to produce and sell, increasing supply and inducing demand; this underlies unsustainable energy consumption. This explains, in part, why efficiency is the poor relation of European energy policy. There are a number of positive aspects of the report, particularly its statement that energy efficiency is ‘a major element in ensuring the sustainability of the use of energy resources’, and its mention of smart meters, of energy-efficient buildings, and of concern for small and medium-sized enterprises. Nonetheless, it is missing the crucial element: a break with neoliberal policies to enable energy efficiency that does not try to paper over the crisis and the ever greater energy poverty in Europe.</p>

Small and medium-sized businesses in particular – including installation and construction companies – would benefit. This directive is Europe’s chance to honour the Heads of State’s energy and climate commitment of March 2007 and 2011: realising a 20% rise in the EU’s energy efficiency will lead to a reduction against the trend of 368 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2020. A common EU approach is necessary to reinforce energy savings, energy efficiency and innovation, achieve economies of scale and reduce the bureaucratic burden in all Member States.

      <p sl="pl">The Commission did consider the impact on the market and finally decided quite rightly to take action to improve energy efficiency, but the report has, in fact, failed to address this subject properly. Objective criteria are needed for measuring the real gross efficiency of the Member States, both at micro-economic and macro-economic levels. The macro-economic aspect should be examined by looking at the rate of growth, calculated as the year-on-year difference in primary energy consumption per unit of GDP per capita for each country, divided by baseline consumption per unit of GDP per capita and expressed as a percentage. Energy policy, as it was defined when the Member States adopted the very worthy 20-20-20 objectives in 2007, has been distorted by the Climate and Energy Package, which introduces unfair competition by discriminating against countries whose energy mix is dominated by coal as a source of primary energy. The Climate and Energy Package represents a departure from economic realities: the Member States are being forced to pursue different objectives at the same time. We do not have an optimal, step-by-step, economically advantageous route to achieving the 20-20-20 objectives. If, alongside responsibility for developing the energy mix, policy objectives are also put in the hands of the Member States, it will result in greater squandering of primary energy and in higher emissions of CO2 than could otherwise realistically be achieved. It is, however, a question of confidence, and a crisis of confidence is where we find ourselves today. For these reasons, I did not endorse the report.</p>

This is an ambitious but not unattainable target, provided that we invest more in sectoral energy efficiency measures. That is why I welcome the adoption at first reading of the directive on energy efficiency, which, once implemented by Member States, will help to stimulate green growth and employment and to fight against waste. In practical terms, public buildings will have to be adapted in order to improve their energy performance, large companies will have to carry out energy audits, energy suppliers will be required to encourage their customers to make savings and so forth. Finally, the directive encourages the development of cogeneration in inaccessible or rural areas.

It is possible to involve EU funding sources, as well as private sources, including on the basis of revolving funds. Other resources of around EUR 400 billion may be achieved by 2020 directly from energy savings. An important source of savings may be the renovation of buildings which account for 40% of the EU’s energy consumption.

This proposed directive emphasises that the switch to a more energy-efficient economy will also improve the competitiveness of industry in the Union, thereby promoting economic growth and creating high-quality jobs in a number of sectors related to energy efficiency. That is obviously to be welcomed. Nonetheless, the fundamental question arises here as to whether global warming can actually be mitigated or limited by the planned measures. In view of the fact that this is primarily a natural phenomenon, it must be assumed that the proposed measures will mean substantial additional costs for public budgets and for companies which, in the end, will have no effect. All this at a time of crisis. I therefore voted against the proposed directive.</p>

I regard in particular the provisions on developing efficient power grids and promoting cogeneration as important because this provides a future solution for meeting local heating and electricity needs. This solution is extremely suitable for rural areas where large resources of timber are available.

      <p sl="pl">Increasing energy efficiency is one of the best methods for combating climate warming. I think the measures currently being taken to improve the energy efficiency of residential buildings are extremely beneficial. In Poland’s case, the financial assistance being made available for insulating buildings and replacing windows has produced one of the most visible signs of Poland’s membership in the European Union. Public opinion is unequivocal in its approval. So I welcome the proposal for a directive on energy efficiency, which includes a requirement that each year, the Member States renovate 3% of the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings owned and occupied by government institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I regret that Parliament did not manage to push through its proposal for the renovation of all public buildings and not just central government buildings. On the other hand, the approach which has been adopted is an important step towards achieving the objectives on greenhouse gas reductions. An extremely important feature is that the directive reduces the gap preventing us from reaching the objective of a 20% saving in energy by 2020. We can now guarantee that we will be able to reduce energy consumption by 15%. If the former rules were still in force, only a 9% reduction could realistically be expected. This is a result which falls far short of expectations and needs. For these reasons, I decided to endorse the report on energy efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The report on energy efficiency is one of the EP’s most significant tasks in the current parliamentary term. It is a very important piece of legislation for EU citizens and companies, helping to combat the economic crisis and unemployment. The EU does not have direct measures to reduce global oil and gas prices, but it can help to reduce energy consumption. This directive will also create two million jobs for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the construction sector. This is also crucial for young people. Energy efficiency not only saves money, but also protects the environment leading to fewer emissions. I voted in favour of this report because it is particularly important for EU citizens living through difficult times. An increase in the price of energy resources has a particularly painful impact on EU Member States that are still in a difficult economic situation and the weakest layers of their societies. It is important that this directive is not just seen as a document promoting energy efficiency. It is also important to save energy resources in everyday life.</p>

In line with the EU 2020 targets, the proposal for a new directive seeks to reduce the European Union’s energy use by 20%. Energy saving, environmental protection and sustainable growth will be safeguarded by specific provisions that will channel energy companies towards better control, partly through the use of new technologies. This will limit firms’ wastage without constraining individual Member States too much. Energy efficiency means savings on energy costs, an increase in security and specialisation and development of industries and, for these reasons, we can only back these targets.</p>

Policy at EU and national level must now be reoriented with a view to swiftly implementing and fully maximising the benefits of these new rules, which are a concrete tool for responding to the economic crisis.

Member States should set an example and implement a 3% annual renovation rate for buildings of public bodies. As for large companies, they will be required to carry out energy audits.

Finally, according to the Commission’s estimates, in the face of an increase in costs of approximately EUR 24 billion per year for investments in the energy efficiency sector, the legislative proposal would lead to an overall reduction in the costs of investing in energy generation and distribution and the costs of the ‘energy bill’, amounting to approximately EUR 20 billion for the 2011-2020 period.

      <p sl="fr">High energy costs, pollution and climate change are just a few of the many reasons for us to support strong initiatives to ensure energy efficiency in our social and industrial models. This does not mean going back to the time of candles or initiating a trend of decline; instead, it means adopting modern methods and concrete objectives to rationalise our consumption, both individually and collectively. That is precisely the aim of this regulation, which I supported, and which sets objectives for Member States to achieve by 2020. This recommendation is in keeping with the idea of the energy and climate package, that is, to achieve energy savings of 20% over the next eight years. Achieving energy efficiency, in my view, involves encouraging the small everyday efforts, such as opting to use public transport over cars or keeping an eye on household energy use. However, it also requires public authorities to implement an extensive programme to ensure the implementation of insulation and environmental standards in buildings: that is where the main potential for improvement can be found. We have the required technology and know-how; the only thing missing is political will.

      <p sl="de">I feel that this directive is a classic case of ‘We have prevented something worse, but it is not good’. The European Commission’s proposal on energy efficiency had very strong traits of the planned economy about it: I find the idea of annual energy saving targets for energy companies – in this case, savings of 1.5% of their energy sales to end customers year on year, without exceptions or substitution measures – very reminiscent of our former East German planned economy under communism. Nonetheless, we as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) were able to prevent the worst of it, as in the case of the energy saving target. Nonetheless, there is a more flexible catalogue of measures that could be used to achieve this aim, such as tax relief for investments in energy efficiency. In addition, initially, only central governments must renovate 3% of their public building stock, not all of public administration – which would include the local authorities, for example. I stand by my criticism of both the content and the process. The main thing we must ensure at the moment is that our enterprises and our citizens have affordable electricity available and that we do not wave through the next do-gooder directive in a knee-jerk process – a directive that was already fully negotiated before Parliament as a whole could do anything with it.

I supported this report because ultimately, it was balanced and did not introduce burdensome requirements on business which would have driven companies out of the EU and cost jobs. We need incentives to encourage more energy efficiency, not draconian penalties. This is why I am aghast at the Commission’s decision to threaten the UK with legal action in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) over reduced VAT on energy saving materials. VAT was reduced to 5% on energy efficiency products in the UK in order to tackle fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions. This is exactly the kind of spur we need to encourage the installation of energy efficiency measures such as double-glazing or loft insulation. The Commission’s challenge is not only muddle-headed, but also mistaken: the reduced VAT rate is beyond the scope of the EU’s VAT Directive. If the EU really wishes to embrace energy efficiency, it should – rather than penalise Britain – encourage other Member States to introduce similar schemes.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report on energy efficiency, which was debated earlier today, is one of few parts of the Europe 2020 strategy which does not have a detrimental effect on the economy. However, as with other features of the strategy, reducing energy consumption by 20% is also very expensive for the Member States, particularly during an economic crisis. Therefore, the increase in energy efficiency should principally be a matter of better efficiency in insulating residential buildings and of increasing energy efficiency in industry, including an improvement in the efficiency of energy transmission.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Deployment of smart grids and modernisation of existing ones is a strategic and exceptionally expensive exercise. In Poland, most power lines are over 30 years old, so their modernisation, essential to comply with the requirements of the directive, is an extremely expensive exercise, and the provisions of the directive we have voted on do not include sufficient funding for such work. Furthermore, they do not make any concessions to the EU’s new Member States.

      <p sl="pt">We agree with the general objective of increasing energy efficiency. However, it is regrettable that the much-ballyhooed target of 20% by 2020 – one of the five core objectives of the failed Europe 2020 strategy – is far from being achieved. The same principles – liberalisation of the energy market, and subsidised private production from renewable energy sources – are still guiding EU energy policy, so it is no surprise that the target is unlikely to be hit because so-called market rules rarely result in energy efficiency. The neoliberal workings of the economy involve producing and selling, increasing supply and inducing demand; the effect of that is not to reduce consumption of the good produced. There are several positive aspects of the report: smart meters, energy-efficient buildings, and the concern for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, were the intention a measure to help consumers in a period of crisis, we would need to regulate the prices charged by the companies supplying energy services, which make large profits. The report does not meddle with the interests of these monopolistic companies, placing the onus for energy efficiency exclusively on the consumer.</p>

Under no circumstances can state secrecy supersede fundamental and inalienable rights, so it will never be possible for arguments based on such a situation to limit states’ legal obligation to investigate serious breaches of human rights. There also needs to be provision for guarantees to prevent the Member States from disrespecting human rights when implementing their anti-terrorist policies, despite having declared their desire to comply with international law. Not all the Member States have yet met their obligation to investigate serious breaches of human rights relating to the CIA programme.

It even goes so far as to call on the bourgeois governments involved in the crimes to investigate themselves, supposedly in order to get to the truth, which has been proven and is known to everyone except the European Parliament. The Greek Communist Party reaffirms its position that the European Parliament committee in question and the reports which it has drafted are hypocritical and are aimed essentially at defusing popular disapproval and covering up the responsibilities of the governments of the EU Member States.

The motion for a resolution expresses in the clearest possible way the wish of the European Parliament that human rights should not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism, that terrorist suspects should not be tried under a special judicial procedure, that the US administration should close the Guantánamo base immediately and that UN resolutions on human dignity in general should be respected. It also calls on the European Council to acknowledge the very obvious fact that European Treaties were violated during illegal transfers of detainees by the CIA via European territories, to investigate the cases in question, and to ensure that they do not reoccur.

In particular, the governments of individual countries had to make decisions after the terrorist attacks in New York, London and Madrid. The use of special measures seemed at that time to be essential. The suggestion made in the report that those suspected of being the leaders of terrorist organisations should have been given the same legal privileges as are enjoyed by suspects in our own criminal cases is mistaken.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, the report makes an unfair evaluation of those decisions but does not say what should have been done instead. We all respect the universal nature and indivisibility of human rights, but we also have to know the difference between a common criminal and a terrorist who plans and carries out a suicide attack on a military target or innocent civilians. For this reason, I could not endorse this report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On this occasion of the painful 11th anniversary of the attacks on New York’s Twin Towers, Parliament took a new look into the issue of the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in certain European countries by the CIA (with a particular focus on Lithuania, Poland and Romania), and called on these Member States to shed as much light as possible on secret detention programmes implemented by the CIA in Europe in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001, and on human rights violations committed in this context. In other words, this is about investigating in order to establish the possible existence in these countries of secret prisons or facilities, where persons may have been detained under a secret CIA rendition programme. It is indeed quite clear that there are still some grey areas with regard to this matter. The resolution approved in this sense calls for the Commission to create a framework, by the end of 2012, allowing full light to be shed on these activities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Eleven years on from the events of 11 September 2001 and the United States’ declaration of war on terrorism, there are still many grey areas with regard to the issue of secret CIA prisons in Europe. The fight against terrorism requires a determined commitment from the European Union and its main international partners. It is vital that the 27 Member States implement effective measures to improve the everyday security of EU citizens, and that they conduct investigations to rule out any risk of an attack. This process must be transparent and must not violate human rights. The European Union is an area in which the law is fully applicable and in which Member States cannot be involved in illegal activities. Secret detention must only be possible on the grounds of national security, and acts of torture must not be allowed on EU territory.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report has the virtue of drawing attention to the heinous fact, now irrefutable, that the CIA used the territory of a number of EU countries to transport people who, without any charge or arrest warrant, were transported to the US military base in Guantánamo and to various countries, where they were tortured and, according to some reports, murdered in some cases. This fact is all the more serious because there is a dense web of silence and complicity surrounding the bilateral agreements between the Council, the Member States, the US, NATO and the CIA. They all involved illegal and arbitrary detention, torture, and the mistreatment and forced disappearance of hundreds of people as part of the supposed War on Terror. While we support this report, we do not share the federalist perspective that shapes it, seeking to set up the Council as judge of the Member States and involving the Commission in ensuring ‘accountability for human rights violations committed in the context of the CIA programme’. Nor do we agree with the uncritical approach to NATO – which is in this up to its neck – and its role as an organisation whose history demonstrates its links to terrorism, particularly state terrorism.</p>

The instruments governing the EU’s common foreign and security policy mandate an absolute ban on torture and also entail an express obligation to investigate allegations of torture and to provide remedies and reparation. EU guidelines on torture provide the framework for the EU’s efforts to prevent and eradicate torture and ill-treatment in all parts of the world.

The resolution also rightly raises the need for human rights to be strictly respected at all times in the fight against terrorism, which I support, as under no circumstances and under no pretext can the fight against terrorism be conducted, as it was in this case, outside the international legal framework, nor can it violate human rights in any way.

This is particularly worrying if it turns out to be the case that these people were transported on to third countries where they faced torture. EU governments have obligations under international law and EU law. There is a political, a legal and also a moral responsibility to uncover the truth about any collusion in extraordinary rendition.

In any case, the participation of EU Member States, such as Poland and Romania, in CIA practices which violate human rights casts a gloomy light on the EU’s self-styled community of values. The scandal surrounding the CIA flights and secret prisons shows that, when a choice has to be made between the two, cosying up to the US is apparently more important to us than respect for fundamental human rights.

Human rights violations can never be tolerated, especially when they are committed by EU Member States that like to give lessons to the rest of the world in this field. No political realism is valid in this area, and even the fight against terrorism does not justify such abuses. The credibility of the European Union and its Member States is at stake. Much work still remains to be done in order to establish the truth about this programme and acknowledge the multiple violations which have been committed.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report has the virtue of drawing attention to the heinous and irrefutable facts that the CIA used the territory of a number of EU countries to transport people who, without any charge or arrest warrant, were transported to Guantánamo and various countries, where they were tortured and even murdered. These facts are still being obscured by a web of silence and complicity surrounding the bilateral and multilateral agreements concluded between the Council, the Member States, the US, NATO and the CIA, concerning illegal and arbitrary detention, torture, and the mistreatment and forced disappearance of hundreds of people as part of the supposed War on Terror. While we support this report, we do not share the federalist perspective that shapes it, seeking to set up the Council as judge of the Member States and involving the Commission in ensuring ‘accountability for human rights violations committed in the context of the CIA programme’. Nor do we agree with the uncritical approach to NATO and its role as an organisation whose history demonstrates its links to terrorism, particularly state terrorism. For our part, we have been warning about this issue since 2005 and demanding explanations from the Portuguese Government in relation to it. We will carry on in that vein.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report. I would re-emphasise that the EU has undertaken to complete the creation of a common European asylum system (CEAS) in 2012 by establishing a common area of protection and solidarity, based on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted international protection. I consider the CEAS an evolutionary step in European policy, which will bring harmonisation of standards of protection, which is under way through the modification of Member States’ legislation and practical cooperation enhanced through the European Asylum Support Office. It is now important to tackle head on the third pillar of the CEAS by giving substance to the notion of solidarity and responsibility sharing, enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which constitutes an essential horizontal component of the CEAS. In other words, the CEAS is important specifically because it aims to be a comprehensive solidarity framework wherein Member States are assisted in improving the quality of their asylum systems with a view to ensuring the full respect of asylum seekers’ rights, which would ensure, by the same token, proper implementation of the asylum acquis .</p>

      <p sl="it">Clearly, the humanitarian crisis happening in the Middle East will have serious repercussions for Europe and, in particular, those Member States bordering the Mediterranean, such as Italy. Effective action is required to improve coordination between Member States, through appropriate sharing of responsibilities to ensure that their own asylum systems meet both European and international standards and, in addition, through the fair distribution of asylum seekers. According to the latest Eurostat estimates, Italy received 2 210 new requests for asylum in the first quarter of 2012 alone. On average, asylum seekers are very young, 67.2% being between the ages of 18 and 34 and 17.9% being minors. I welcome the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the creation, as from 2014, of the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF). These are very useful tools for taking targeted action to support states that bear huge burdens and responsibilities, and to support asylum seekers and the international protection that they hope for in a better future.</p>

In 2011, the EU received more than 300 000 asylum applications – 16.2% more than in 2010. I agree that we need to support those Member States whose asylum systems have a very large caseload of applicants by introducing an instrument to relocate asylum applicants or asylum beneficiaries from Member States facing a particular burden to other EU Member States. I agree that we need to inform Member States and civil society about EU funds for asylum policy and provide information related to eligibility criteria and application formalities.

Member States’ asylum systems should be regularly and frequently evaluated to identify best practices as well as deficiencies.

In an efficient CEAS, Member States, authorities and citizens should be informed about the different EU funds which can be used for asylum purposes. Furthermore, information on eligibility criteria and legal formalities is also very important. Member States’ asylum systems could be regularly evaluated to identify best practices as well as deficiencies and to facilitate the elaboration of specific solutions. Solidarity and the sharing of responsibility among Member States are also very valuable, particularly as regards the relocation of beneficiaries of international protection and the processing of asylum applications. It is very important to make the best use of the EU funds available because only then will solidarity turn into action and we therefore need to introduce financial incentives for relocating beneficiaries of international protection.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union would like to be an area of democracy. This is why I think that a common policy on the right of asylum is required. This policy is in line with the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 and the Protocol of 31 January 1967 on the status of refugees, as well as with other treaties in this area. This common system enables EU Member States to undertake to guarantee people seeking to obtain refugee status in the EU a level of protection based on high standards and in keeping with these obligations.

      <p sl="it">Experience in this field teaches us that loosening the constraints of responsibility and solidarity between the Member States invariably leads to a losing game, in which occasionally an individual country, often a country bordering the Mediterranean, cannot cope with a sharp rise in flows of refugees and is held up as a bad example.</p>

In particular, I would point out the recommendations in point 47, which, if turned into specific measures, would make it possible to unite the Member States in an effective obligation of shared responsibility and mutual solidarity, ensuring – and this is the fundamental goal – that the tragic situation of asylum seekers is dealt with on an appropriate scale, with humanity, reason and realism.</p>

      <p sl="en">The prospect of enhancing what is confusingly called intra-EU solidarity in the field of asylum is essentially a move to centralise decision making on the placement of asylum seekers which contravenes domestic prerogative on immigration and settlement policy. While it is essential all countries play their part in the accommodation of genuine asylum seekers and the international community must work together to protect vulnerable persons, I greatly fear placing the power to relocate asylum seekers in the hands of the European Union. The forging of tighter cooperation between countries on the management of refugees should happen between national governments or by international supranational bodies and charities that are already endorsed to deal with such matters. The establishment of a permanent intra-EU relocation mechanism would create a precedent allowing the European Commission to essentially determine who lives where, representing a gross infringement upon sovereignty. While certain countries are under greater pressures than others to accommodate asylum seekers and there is sense in promoting burden sharing between nations, the processing of applications for residency must continue to be done solely at Member State level and should never become the preserve of the unelected European Commission.</p>

It is essential that there be a climate of reciprocal trust. That is why it is so important to change Schengen governance, so as to ensure proper application of the Schengen acquis and to increase trust in the EU’s ability to tackle jointly and in a spirit of solidarity the problems relating to border checks.

Asylum seekers enter Europe not only by sea; countries of final destination – like Sweden – should be taken into account as well. The external borders and absolute numbers of asylum seekers should not be the only criteria in order to receive more support and financial aid. Relocation among Member States should be voluntary for Member States and should concern only people that have already been granted asylum, with their consent, and not asylum seekers.

The EU still ignores the situation of many millions of human beings who are fleeing hunger and war, and seeking dignified lives and work for themselves and their families. Millions of human beings are coming up against the EU’s repressive policies, one of the expressions of which is the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex). They are fleeing chronic poverty. They are fleeing a political and economic situation that is often tragic and to which EU policy has been contributing.

Furthermore, such an initiative ensures Member States would be equipped to improve the quality of their asylum procedures and have in place an adequate framework to ensure asylum seekers’ rights are fully respected. However, if Europe wants a holistic asylum system, it must understand that very often, asylum seekers are victims of political repression, of organised crime or of economic poverty. Thus, initiatives must also involve the countries from which these immigrants depart, and must address the problems, especially economic problems, of the immigrants’ countries of origin.

In this context, there can – and must – be a multi-faceted approach to solidarity, based on enhanced practical cooperation, targeted financial aid and a fair division of responsibilities. In addition to solidarity, however, we need to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of their responsibilities. Mutual trust – the driving force behind solidarity – cannot be revived and stimulated unless each country fulfils its responsibilities and obligations in the area of asylum. That is the kind of approach that we are arguing for: an approach based on both solidarity and responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with the rapporteur that establishing a solidarity framework will not absolve Member States from complying with their international as well as their EU obligations in terms of asylum, but that rather it will equip the CEAS with specific instruments and procedures aimed at supporting and assisting those Member States facing disproportionate pressures and costs in the field of asylum, mainly due to their geographical or demographical situation. In other words, a comprehensive solidarity framework wherein Member States would be assisted to improve the quality of their asylum systems in order to ensure the full respect of asylum seekers’ rights would ensure, by the same token, the proper implementation of the asylum acquis and therefore the very functioning of the CEAS.</p>

      <p sl="de">The common European asylum system in its present form is moving in a worrying direction. As long as the Union refuses to finally admit that it cannot accommodate every single economic migrant from every corner of the world, hundreds of thousands more will continue to hit the road. When we pass measures such as a mass amnesty for illegal immigrants or the Schengen Treaty, whose weakness was most recently demonstrated by the abuse of tourist visas, the inevitable result is tens of thousands more refugees. This is putting the entire Schengen system at risk of collapse. Greece, Italy and Malta are obviously not capable of securing the EU’s external borders and Schengen newcomers often fall short in their efforts once admitted to the zone. Other Member States are then forced to pay the price – in the name of internal solidarity within the Union. The EU actually needs to upgrade Frontex into an effective border management agency.

A rights-based approach and the defence of people’s rights to asylum, a life in dignity and without fear of repression must be the priority of any asylum policy. I also support the view that gender-based reasons for seeking asylum must get greater priority.

      <p sl="de">The development of a common European asylum system has posed significant challenges for the European Union. Europe is unable to accommodate all the economic migrants that come here and Mediterranean countries like Italy, Greece and Malta are unable to secure their external borders effectively. Therefore, steps must be taken to ensure that Frontex finally becomes a well-functioning border control agency. The asylum system in Europe should not be allowed to become a vehicle for mass immigration and it is clear that there need to be strict principles in EU asylum laws which protect, above all, the legitimate interests of EU citizens. Furthermore, it needs to be a system that analyses the causes of migration in a global context. Most migrants leave their home countries mainly because of the lack of opportunities there and the EU would be well advised to analyse these factors and to do more to encourage the refugees’ countries of origin to establish a fairer economic system. As long as we in Europe fail to recognise that, thousands of refugees who have no right to asylum under existing law will continue to pour into Europe. I did not support the report because it fails to take account of all of these considerations.</p>

Considering that harmonisation of standards of protection is under way through the modification of Member States’ legislation and practical cooperation is to be enhanced through the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), it is now important to tackle head on the third pillar of the CEAS by giving substance to the notion of solidarity and responsibility sharing, enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and that is why I voted in favour.</p>

The report argues that the relocation process must take the interests of asylum seekers into account when they are distributed among the Member States. During the debates on this report, the Commission stated that the number of asylum seekers had been falling for ten years, basing this on the fall in the number of asylum seekers arriving on European territory. We know all too well what is going on here and how ‘Fortress Europe’ is being constructed to the detriment of migrants’ rights and the international obligations of the EU Member States.

Asylum applications in EU Member States are still increasing and there are very few positive responses, since the Dublin Regulation is far from meeting the needs of a more humanist approach to this issue. The EU still ignores the situation of many millions of human beings who are fleeing hunger and war, and seeking dignified lives and work for themselves and their families. They are coming up against the EU’s repressive policies, one of the expressions of which is the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex). They are fleeing chronic poverty and seeking what is denied by politicians with a common thread in their countries and the EU: exploitation. They are fleeing a political and economic situation that is often tragic and to which EU policy has been contributing. To ignore this situation or pretend not to see it is to be complicit. The EU – and the majority in Parliament – is complicit when using the historical relationships of dependence on peripheral countries to impose free trade agreements, when this promotes interference and war that leads to the destruction of these countries.</p>

I agree that standards need to be harmonised in the services sector, where there is a lack of standards.</p>

      <p sl="it">In particular, I welcome two aspects of the new proposal: the creation of a new notification system through which European enterprises will be informed in advance when the Commission intends to submit standards, and the extension of the scope of the regulation in question to standards concerning all services, which account for more than 70% of EU GDP.</p>

Given the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the European economy, we need to strengthen the involvement of SMEs in standardisation and facilitate their access to standards, which should be comprehensible and easy for them to use. I believe that it is very important for European standards to be developed within a reasonable period of time, in particular, in those areas where standards are needed quickly in order to meet the requirements of public policies and rapidly changing market conditions. Member States should therefore send representatives to take part in all national technical committees because standardisation is an important tool of EU legislation and public policies and only then can we ensure the proper functioning of legislation in the areas covered by the new approach. The services sector, for instance, is very important economically and has a lot of potential, but there is still a lack of standards in this area. Their development would promote harmonisation in the services sector, increase the competitiveness, quality and transparency of European services and promote consumer protection and innovation.</p>

Innovation in this field, resulting from agreements within sectors including through forums, is certainly a sign of life, but this activity cannot be left to an entirely private process: without an institutional stimulus, it would be difficult to overcome technical and regulatory obstacles and market fragmentation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, a rather disorganised network of standards arising from trade relations, negotiated beyond the sphere of action of the European standardisation organisations (ESOs), could cause market distortions. The impetus for standardisation naturally comes from society and from the market and meets requirements in terms of development, reduced costs for businesses, and increased value of products and services, which are very clear to consumers. It would be rather strange if the European institutions were to marginalise themselves in this area.</p>

We want to involve small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as representatives of environmental organisations, consumers and civil society in the development of these standards, so that we can guarantee that the opinions of end users, in particular, those with specific needs such as disabled and elderly people, are taken into account and that products respond to their needs.

In particular, the regulation focuses on social inclusion, on participation and consultation of stakeholders, and on services, paying particular attention to the role of small and medium-sized enterprises. In this regard, I believe it is appropriate to place special emphasis on the fact that standards are important for the competitiveness of enterprises, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, and they are vital for development. This regulation will enable small and medium-sized enterprises to cut costs and to increase their competitiveness on the European market, thus increasing their participation in and access to standards, allowing them to have a say in establishing standards. Finally, this regulation will bring about the following main benefits: better interaction between markets; more transparency; improved standards; facilitation and simplification of the work of enterprises and an improved quality of life for consumers.

I consider European standardisation a prerequisite for the smooth running of any European market that aims to be single. A single market that is transparent and uniform as regards rules and the standardisation of the products sold therein was one of the main objectives of the EU’s founding countries, when they created the European Coal and Steel Community and then the European Economic Community. For too long, we have had British, German French, Spanish, Italian or Swedish standards for industrial products, for example, competing with each other and – surprisingly – with the very European standards created for the entire EU. It is also surprising that, within a ‘single market’, the imperial system coexists with the metric system.

      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur argues that standardisation ‘helps to boost the competitiveness of enterprises by facilitating, in particular, the free movement of goods and services’ and increases ‘competition and lower output and sales costs’. As such, standardisation is considered a step towards consolidating the single market, free competition and, that being the case, the divergences and asymmetries resulting therefrom. Another issue we are concerned about is the intention of developing European standards in the service sector, as provided for in the Services Directive, which the report states ‘should generate further harmonisation in the service sector, increasing the transparency, quality and competitiveness of European services’. This idea is intrinsically bound up with the intention of liberalising the service sector. This liberalisation of services is, in turn, intrinsically bound up with the assault on public services and the social functions of the state, and it could have serious implications for various countries, specifically those with weaker social situations, thus exacerbating the crisis that we are currently experiencing, not least in Portugal. Naturally, we acknowledge the importance of standardising products and processes in contemporary economies and societies.

Standardisation contributes to many aspects of economic activity, particularly in terms of growth, productivity and the opening of markets. Among other things, the proposal seeks to shorten the standardisation process in cases where standards are drafted at the request of the Commission, to ensure that SMEs and societal stakeholders are properly represented in the standardisation process, and to make the application of information and communication technology standards more widespread, thereby improving interoperability and increasing the number of standards on innovative and rapidly developing production technologies, such as nanotechnology, biotechnology and nuclear technology, and also stepping up the consolidation of existing legislative frameworks.

      <p sl="hu">Considering the rapid advances in technology and innovation, the establishment of uniform standards at European level is particularly important. In order to ensure the competitiveness of the European Union and that safe products are placed on the market, these uniform standards must be valid and applicable in all Member States. I agree with the acceleration of standardisation, but it should be a fundamental criterion that this process should by no means come at the cost of quality. The primary aim should be accelerating the process in terms of administration; measures in this regard should be implemented jointly by the standardisation bodies and the Commission. There is much potential in European standardisation in respect of supporting both legislation and public policies. I appreciate that the report recognises this potential and stresses that the development of standards should move towards new areas, such as services. As Ms Comi mentioned, the new European model must facilitate European innovation and sustainable development. I completely agree with this. As we can see, standardisation, coupled with the principle of mutual recognition, plays a central part in the proper functioning of the internal market. Additionally, it contributes to the protection of the health and safety of European consumers, and to environmental protection.

Improving transparency, consultation and involvement of the relevant parties in the process are crucial elements needed to guarantee that standards are useful and truly market-driven tools preserving fundamental and social principles. The focal point of the standardisation process should be the involvement of SMEs in the standardisation activities, particularly in the work of national standardisation bodies. National standardisation organisations should promote and facilitate the access of SMEs to standards and their development by applying special rates and providing bundles of standards at a reduced price.

      <p sl="pl">Standardisation plays a key role in the functioning of the single market. Harmonised European standards help ensure the free flow of goods and enable businesses in the EU to be more competitive. The introduction of legislation intended to enhance the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the standard-setting process is something which I think is particularly important. The very low participation of SMEs in the standardisation process gives rise to the fear that the interests of these groups are not properly reflected in the standards. So I think we must support the involvement of SMEs in standardisation by identifying appropriate policies and introducing good practices, for example, but also by introducing European standards which are comprehensible and easy to use. It should be stressed that standardisation affects the safety of consumers, giving them clear information about the standard of the product concerned. Therefore, it should also be a priority to increase consumers’ participation in the standardisation process.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think a very good feature is the inclusion of standards for services in the legal framework on European standardisation. This is something new, but the great variety of services available means that standardisation of services will certainly have a positive impact on further efforts to build and strengthen the single market. Specifying certain standards which businesses could use to evaluate the quality of services is certain to help improve competitiveness. More effective consultations with all interested parties, greater transparency and extending standardisation to services is a rational direction for the development of legislation on European standards.</p>

European standardisation is beneficial in that it helps to boost the competitiveness of enterprises by facilitating, in particular, the free movement of goods and services, network interoperability, means of communication, technological development and innovation. European standardisation also reinforces the global competitiveness of European industry. Standards produce significant positive economic effects, for example, by promoting economic interpenetration on the internal market and encouraging the development of new and improved products or markets and improved supply conditions. Standards thus normally increase competition and lower output and sales costs, benefiting economies as a whole and consumers in particular. Standards may maintain and enhance quality, provide information and ensure interoperability and compatibility, thereby increasing safety and value for consumers.</p>

This happens because standards are not always designed so as to take account of the characteristics and environment of small enterprises, micro-enterprises and small craft businesses.

European companies need to improve their ability to adapt to a changing global economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Standardisation can provide proper support, especially for SMEs. This is why they need to be taken into account when drawing up standardisation criteria. The low level of interest shown by public authorities in participating in the process of devising European standards causes delays and helps maintain the disparities between the EU’s regions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the area of public procurement, harmonising procedures is a priority and, in this regard, digitisation plays an important role. I think it is a priority to get the social players involved in establishing the standardisation criteria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Creating the common framework supporting workers’ safety and rights, people with disabilities and measures aimed at increasing sustainability helps improve social standards in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support this report because I think that the standardisation process is vital for attracting investment from third countries. Potential investors are not very keen on the European markets’ diversity and the lack of links between them.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this legislative proposal on the standardisation system – the Comi report – because it represents great progress in the convergence and harmonisation of the specifications of products and services within the EU. It also eliminates barriers to movement and competition within the internal market. In fact, this is a piece of what is known as the ‘Single Market Act’, announced by the European Commission last year, aimed at consolidating the single market. Standardisation establishes a level playing field in inter-company competition, eliminates national borders, expands companies’ markets, reduces production costs, better defends consumers, and makes the EU economy more externally competitive. Moreover, internal standardisation boosts EU initiatives and efforts to expand standardisation internationally, whether through bilateral trade agreements or through bilateral instruments. Increasing amounts of international trade depend on the convergence of regulatory standards and the removal of ‘non-tariff’ barriers.</p>

The importance of consulting consumer associations when drawing up standards should also be underlined, and this can be of great help, especially for people with specific needs, such as the disabled.</p>

Thanks to these new measures, European businesses will be able to obtain standard solutions to technical problems more quickly, which will allow them to reduce their production costs. These measures will also allow for enhanced compatibility with the international standardisation system. This report will thus contribute to improving the competitiveness of European businesses and to stimulating growth. The Commission has estimated that standards have an impact on the growth of the EU amounting to more than EUR 35 billion per year. During the course of the discussions, I paid particular attention to the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the development of standards, as well as the involvement of consumers – particularly vulnerable ones – in order to ensure that the opinion of end users is taken into account and the products are responsive to their needs. The final text seems to me to be sufficiently balanced, and I support it. The regulation will enter into force at the start of 2013.</p>

The proposed regulation builds on two general public consultations held in 2009 and 2010, the work of the Expert Panel for the review of the European standardisation system (EXPRESS), the White Paper on Modernising ICT Standardisation in the EU – The Way Forward, and the European Parliament resolution of 21 October 2010 on the future of European standardisation.

All this is advantageous, particularly for previously under-represented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will now be better represented and which will now incur lower costs and fewer burdens in general.

I also welcome extending involvement in the process of developing standards to a wider circle of consulted parties – consumer representatives, civil society and social partners. All of these must be fully-fledged members of the dialogue, as they are the ultimate users of products and services and are, at the same time, best able to describe their own specific needs. Functioning European standards will not only mean consumer satisfaction, but will also boost consumer confidence in the single market. Last but not least, we must not forget small and medium-sized enterprises, which may be discriminated against and may even face problems with survival as a result of the non-transparent development and adoption of standards involving a high administrative burden. I am therefore pleased that the representatives of these businesses will also be able to take part in standardisation activities through consultations.</p>

The regulation on standardisation that has been adopted enriches the current legislative framework and provides businesses with a useful tool for achieving harmonisation in the single market. The establishment of clear rules which have the same force in all the countries of the Union will mean that our market can operate on the basis of common production criteria. Through the benefits of simplification, two areas necessary to the development of our free market area will be enhanced: the competitiveness of businesses and the protection of consumers. These two elements in combination are essential for harmonising the European system of production, although we need to exclude social services for citizens. On the one hand, common standards will improve the market; on the other hand, we cannot allow a situation to arise in which the standards applied to consumer goods are also applied to services for citizens. It is up to the Member States to set criteria for the organisation, management and financing of social security and health services; the standardisation process must not be used to regulate the primary needs of citizens.

The main purpose of standardisation is to define voluntary technical or quality specifications which can be complied with by products, production processes or by current or future services. Standardisation can relate to different aspects, such as different classes or dimensions of a particular product or the technical specifications of the product or service markets for which compatibility and interoperability with other products or systems are vital.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The fundamental principles recognised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in the area of standardisation, namely, the principles of coherence, transparency, openness, consensus, voluntary application, independence from particular interests and efficiency, must form the basis for European standardisation. In keeping with these fundamental principles, it is important that all the relevant stakeholders, including public authorities and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are properly involved in the standardisation process at national and European level. National standardisation bodies should encourage and facilitate the stakeholders’ involvement.</p>

We have made great efforts, in recent years, to achieve optimal health protection for our citizens, trying to provide the consumer with information to help increase added value and product quality.

Given the progress achieved through the technique of electronic identification, my report proposes progressive and harmonised development of this technology on a voluntary basis; thus, only for cattle farmers who want it. In five years, we will take stock of this development. We will see, then, if it is a good idea to make electronic identification obligatory, replacing conventional identification through ear tags. As regards the other part of this report – the labelling of beef – my report recommends simplifying the procedure to allow the use of optional mentions on meat packets. For example, this affects information relating to the breed of the animal or the rearing method. Too often, the European Union is perceived as restrictive.

The extension of this technology allows us to enhance the current system in relation to the traceability of bovine animals and foodstuffs by making the system operate more quickly and more precisely. It also aims at making progress in the reduction of administrative charges and the improvement of disease prevention. In the long term, this type of innovation will have an effect on the competitiveness of the sector and is thus a welcome innovation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Greater use of electronic technologies in agriculture is inevitable. Farmers today have to adapt the methods used in production to the requirements and needs of the consumer. Consumers increasingly want to know more about the products they buy, but in the case of raw products such as beef, it is hard to be sure because there are great variations in the conditions under which this meat is produced. The system of electronic identification and registration of bovine animals – using a special ear tag, a chip inserted under the skin or a strap fitted to the animal’s leg – makes it possible to ensure food safety and improve control of the spread of disease among animals. Besides this, I can see many other advantages of this kind of system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The introduction of electronic identification on a wide scale will mean a reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy by enabling all data to be copied and transferred automatically in digital form. As the system develops, the producer could use it to maintain records of individual animals, including a history of diseases suffered, feed used and vaccinations given. The use of an electronic registration system has many possibilities, but a basic condition for its implementation is to ensure the existence of an appropriate IT infrastructure and a body of suitably qualified people who have a thorough knowledge of the technology involved and who can make decisions on ethical questions concerning the storage and transfer of information held by the system. I think this task should be given to the EU institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is essential bovine EID is introduced on a voluntary basis and is not, as some Members of this Parliament urge, subject to a report in five years to consider compulsory EID. The UK cattle ID system works perfectly well, so the choice to upgrade should be an individual decision based upon working preferences. It should be made without fear of penalty under cross compliance if equipment is subject to error. Sheep tagging brought a host of problems that persecuted British farmers whose equipment was especially vulnerable to the elements. Cattle in the UK are often out to grass for at least six months, so tag loss is inevitable. There is a crisis in the dairy industry, while the beef market is only just seeing a small recovery after years of being in the red. Both are subject to pressures from rising feed costs and cheaper foreign imports and would suffer from any punitive measures levied by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The aim of this proposal is to address major challenges with regard to adopting emerging technology for the electronic identification of bovine animals, simplifying the provisions for labelling beef and updating the rules governing the powers conferred on the Commission. It is about ensuring that legislation on the identification and traceability of bovine animals is clear and enforceable, and about optimising food safety.

It is essential to harmonise technical standards in order to prevent this identification method from possibly developing in a chaotic manner and to ensure interoperability between national provisions.</p>

In order to prevent trade from being hindered within the internal market, the Commission must inform Member States about the provisions adopted on the territories of those Member States which have opted for compulsory electronic identification.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Food safety is one of the European public’s concerns and we have to ensure it. Consumer information should be clear, objective and the result of a simple, unbureaucratic process. Voluntary labelling of beef is clearly important, since it prevents the profusion of erroneous consumer information on issues like breed, husbandry and the processing of the meat; consumer information regulations should respond to this. Beef is an extremely sensitive product as regards the EU market, very vulnerable to pressure from third countries with fewer animal welfare and husbandry requirements. I think the labelling system should be improved, but with concrete rules and a clear system of checks that is the same for all Member States, whilst retaining the idea of an EU system that prevents various activities that promote distortions of competition. In other words, it should be obligatory for all Member States, as is the case for poultry and eggs.</p>

We are in favour of recognising the differences in farming systems and practices and in sectoral organisations between the Member States, meaning that the latter should be able to decide whether or not to introduce electronic identification (EID) in their territory, including beef sector organisations in the discussion, and taking into account the potential impact on small farmers. We also have some concerns and doubts about the implications of the process of receiving direct aid. Nevertheless, we are pleased about the care taken that, where EID is faulty, the technological breakdown will not lead to farmers being financially penalised.

      <p sl="en">Rules brought in during 2010 require all sheep farmers to electronically tag their sheep. As a consequence, they face financial penalties if they do not achieve 100% accuracy of recording. Yet, the technology at their disposal is not yet 100% accurate. This situation is completely unacceptable. The Commission now wishes to extend electronic identification to bovine animals. However, it seems to have learned from the negative experience of sheep farmers, and has chosen to introduce bovine identification on a voluntary basis. This is a far more pragmatic approach, allowing all stakeholders to benefit, and as such I can support this measure. Given the shambles surrounding the electronic identification of sheep, and the considerable financial impact on farmers, it is imperative that, whilst adhering to the agreed EU technical standards, Member States have control over its introduction to bovine animals.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of Parliament’s position on the negotiations with the Council because I think that it achieves a good balance between respect for producers and modernising the identification of bovine animals and meat labelling. We must, of course, ensure simple and practical traceability, as well as increased choice for consumers: that is why we must promote electronic identification of bovine animals, which will enable increased rationalisation of the identification process. We must not forget, however, that we are in a period of crisis: we must not force producers to make investments which are too costly, even if they give us the best health conditions in the world. It would be irresponsible to subject small producers to such unnecessary expense when they have already been put in a precarious position by the current economic situation. As regards meat labelling, it is important to combat excessively heavy administrative burdens. As well as being able to ensure that information is true and verifiable, producers must be able to provide details that can help consumers in their choices. It is natural that we should move towards uniform rules for beef and other meats.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In preparation for the negotiations with the EU agriculture ministers, the European Parliament has clarified its position on the electronic identification of bovine animals. Technical progress has been made in the process for identifying bovine animals, but it remains imperfect. Deficiencies remain, and this calls for a gradual adjustment on the part of our farmers. That is why it was essential to ensure that they do not feel disheartened by the ever more burdensome bureaucratic rules emanating from Brussels. Electronic identification of bovine animals will therefore only apply to farmers on a voluntary basis. In five years, an assessment will be carried out in order to decide whether or not it is appropriate to introduce obligatory electronic identification of bovine animals. As for labelling, obligatory information on the origin of animals will not be altered. On the other hand, Parliament is calling for optional information on the quality of beef (breed, husbandry, etc.) to be simplified and brought in line with the labelling rules for other types of meats.</p>

It is essential that implementation of the system remains optional, so that the new technology does not hit farmers who only have small numbers of these animals.

      <p sl="ro">Current legislation needs to be adapted, particularly in order to recognise electronic identification as an official method of identifying bovine animals. The tracing of beef to source via identification and registration is a prerequisite for origin labelling throughout the food chain. These measures safeguard consumer protection and public health, and promote consumer confidence. Using electronic identification systems could streamline traceability processes through automated and more accurate reading and recording in the holding register. Furthermore, it would enable animal movements to be registered automatically in the online database, thereby improving the system’s speed, reliability and accuracy. Using electronic identification systems would improve the management of direct payments to farmers granted per animal, through applying better controls and reducing the risks of payment errors.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is with great satisfaction that I welcomed the rejection of the obligation for electronic identification of cattle, supported by a number of Members who had obviously not been considering the interests of farmers. This measure aroused indignation and concern among farmers, which I shared and which led me to intervene with the Commission to make it aware of this incomprehensible situation. The additional cost and the administrative surcharge created by this technique would have led to the disappearance of many farms, particularly small farms and those located in mountain areas, which would not have been able to respect this obligation, while they are nevertheless an essential part of our heritage, our rural fabric and biodiversity. Although the reinforcement of the legal arsenal can be understood given the imperatives of traceability and food security, from stall to plate, this must not be done to the detriment of the liberty which is inherent to the profession of farmer, especially since the traditional techniques (tattooing, plastic tags) have demonstrated their reliability and durability. I am therefore pleased that, even by a slim majority, the optional nature of electronic identification of cattle will henceforth be the rule, and that this will be developed exclusively on a voluntary basis.</p>

Specifically, we want reinforcement of the obligations that apply when a medicine is withdrawn: from now on, whenever a medicine is to be withdrawn in a Member State, all the European health authorities will have to be notified and provided with a justification for the withdrawal. If there is any suspicion of a risk to health, then, in addition to the withdrawal of the product, an assessment will be carried out to anticipate the potential consequences of the product not functioning properly. We no longer want to have to wait until there is an emergency before we resolve the problems. Finally, it will be possible to look up all medicines subject to enhanced surveillance on a publicly available list – a measure that we have already voted for in France.

The additional amendments to the directive are needed to ensure that the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee can manage its workload and to ensure that patients and health care professionals are fully involved in improving the pharmacovigilance system. Firstly, there must be a clear declaration on the withdrawal of a marketing licence or decision not to reapply for a licence. A list must be made public annually detailing the medicinal products for which marketing authorisations have been refused and the reasons for such action. Secondly, the marketing authorisation holder must also submit a notification if he or she has taken action in a third country because it would be useful for regulators to know if a company withdraws, does not renew or otherwise halts a marketing authorisation in a third country. Thirdly, a drug fact box should be created for the benefit of consumers so that they understand the usefulness of the drug as well as possible risks.</p>

I also wish to express my full support to this agreement as far as the need for further clarification of transparency obligations on companies when they withdraw a drug is concerned: in the aforementioned Mediator scandal, the French company Servier withdrew Mediator from Spain, claiming it was for commercial reasons, thus severely delaying investigations that might have helped save a number of lives estimated between 500 and 2 000.</p>

The range of measures adopted in this new legislation will lead to improved safety of medicines at EU level by strengthening the role of the European Medicines Agency in collecting signs and acting on them, and to increased cooperation among Member States. I think European patients should be better informed about the medicines that they ingest and the secondary effects thereof. The new legislation provides for, inter alia , the creation of a European web portal and national portals on the safety of medicines and methods for patients to notify the national authorities when adverse reactions occur.

As we have stated in previous reports on this very subject, there are aspects of the changes under way that could improve the workings of this mechanism for evaluating, detecting and preventing adverse reactions to medicines. This need for improvement was made obvious with the tragic outcome of the Mediator case, involving a diabetes medicine that caused the deaths of 500 to 2 000 people.</p>

The vote in this House demonstrates a desire to establish a European system to evaluate potential problems with medicinal products.

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the McAvan report because I think that the welfare of the EU’s patients is a priority. To protect our citizens, we should learn from our mistakes and change EU law so that we can react quickly to any kind of threat. As we all know, many criminal investigations are under way in France relating to the medicine Mediator. The amendments to current pharmacovigilance legislation proposed by the Commission in the wake of the Mediator case are a move in the right direction, but I agree with the statement that further changes are needed to close any potential loopholes. I support the Commission’s proposals, which improve pharmacovigilance at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="en">This amendment to the Pharmacovigilance Directive is urgent in light of the Mediator case in France. Mediator was a medicine made by the French company Servier and licensed in a number of EU countries through national procedures (France, Portugal, Luxembourg, Greece, Italy and Spain) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Its main active ingredient was benfluorex, and as early as 1999, the first ADR (Adverse Reaction) reports appeared indicating concerns about possible heart valve disorders. In both the USA and the EU, similar anorectic agents – dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine – were taken off the market in the late 1990s. Despite this, Mediator was widely prescribed in Europe, and particularly in France. By 2009, when the drug was finally withdrawn from the market, an estimated five million people had been prescribed the medicine, and it was one of the top 50 most prescribed medicines in France. Evidence suggests it had been prescribed not only to diabetics, but more widely as a general appetite suppressant. Estimates of the number of deaths related to Mediator vary from 500 to 2 000.</p>

In 2010, the European system already underwent considerable modernisation in order to allow for greater surveillance of medicines that appear on the market.

      <p sl="sk">At the end of 2010, the European Parliament and the Council agreed a revision of the rules governing the area of pharmacovigilance at European Union level. Application of this new legislation started in July this year. The measures aim to achieve an improvement in the safety of medicines at European level by strengthening the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in collecting data and enhancing cooperation between Member States. One of the stimuli was the case of the medicine Mediator last year. Mediator was a medicine developed by the French company Servier for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Its main active ingredient is benfluorex, which can cause heart valve disorders. The adverse effects of this substance have been discussed since the late nineties. The safety of this medicine is still under investigation. Even despite this, it was prescribed to almost 5 million EU citizens up to 2009, mostly in France. The number of deaths related to this medicine is estimated to be up to 2 000. I therefore consider it necessary to reach an agreement with the Council as swiftly as possible that will ensure that similar mistakes are not made again.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the proposal for amending Directive 2001/83/EC as regards pharmacovigilance because recent events relating to pharmacovigilance in the EU have highlighted the need for an automatic procedure at EU level in the specific cases of safety issues, in order to ensure that the problem is assessed and dealt with in all the Member States where the medicine is authorised.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The normal procedure should be triggered for the quality, safety and effectiveness of medicines when the EU’s interests are at stake. The urgent EU-level procedure should be triggered when a quick assessment needs to be carried out of the concerns which have arisen following the assessment of the data produced by pharmacovigilance activities. Irrespective of whether the urgent or normal procedure is applied at EU level or of the procedure, centralised or not, used to authorise the medicine, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee should always submit a recommendation if the reason for taking action is based on pharmacovigilance data. The measures adopted reinforce substantially the legal framework for monitoring medicines through provisions consolidating the coordinating role of the European Medicines Agency, through the options for signal detection and through the application of harmonised procedures at EU level.</p>

The case in 2011 of the medicine Mediator represents only a fraction of the chaos which reigns in the pharmaceuticals market. For example, I would like to call renewed attention to the problems with stents, which continued to be authorised for use in many of the EU’s Member States, despite the fact that in the US, from where they were imported, authorisation for their use had been withdrawn.

Firstly, if drugs are subject to a post-authorisation safety study, or other conditions or requirements, they should be included in the list of ‘black symbol’ drugs subject to additional monitoring. Secondly, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee will not be constituted until July 2012, and so the 12-month deadline to choose a black symbol should start from then. Thirdly, the urgent procedure should be triggered automatically. Fourthly, the urgent procedure should be triggered if, for safety reasons, companies decide not to apply to renew a marketing licence.

Already in the UK, we have bodies such as NICE to evaluate and test products with any sort of pharmaceutical or pharmacological usage before they are permitted into mainstream medicine. What we need is greater national vigilance against unauthorised and unknown drugs and access to unapproved products on the black market. Some of the EU’s proposals for pharmacovigilance could result in a rise in scaremongering that may, in turn, result in patients not accessing drugs that would otherwise be highly beneficial on the grounds of an unqualified threat. We have already seen the results of parents denying their children vital immunisation due to inconclusive links with autism that were blown out of proportion by the media.

      <p sl="pt">This report by Linda McAvan concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 as regards pharmacovigilance. In December 2010, Parliament and the Council agreed a revision of the rules governing pharmacovigilance at EU level by adopting Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010. The range of measures adopted in this new legislation will lead to improved safety of medicines at EU level by strengthening the role of the European Medicines Agency in collecting signs and acting on them, and in increasing cooperation among Member States. I think European patients should be better informed about the medicines that they ingest and the secondary effects thereof. The new legislation provides for, inter alia , the creation of a European web portal and national portals on the safety of medicines and methods for patients to notify the national authorities when adverse reactions occur. In this regard, the benefits of working with 500 million people, rather than each Member State working individually, are clear.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Union had to react to the Mediator scandal, which claimed hundreds of victims, due to a lack of effective alert and response mechanisms in the face of a harmful drug. I voted for this amendment to the European legislation on pharmacovigilance because I think it is moving in the right direction: that of transparency and control. I think that the three main measures it introduces are very important: the real reasons behind a company’s decision to withdraw a medicine in a country will be known, these medicines will be systematically subjected to an urgent assessment, which will reveal the levels of hazard, and finally, a symbol on the medicine’s packaging will inform patients and practitioners if the medicine has been subject to an additional safety study. Within the framework of the organisation of the market for medicine, in which the EU has some powers, these measures will help to ensure, at EU level, that a health crisis such as the one we saw with Mediator will never happen again.</p>

The Commission is now proposing to make the urgent procedure purely automatic. · A new trigger for the urgent procedure (Article 107i, directive): if companies decide not to apply to renew a marketing licence (as was the case for Mediator), and if this is due to safety reasons, then this should trigger the urgent procedure. · Clarification of transparency obligations on companies (Article 123(2), directive): when companies voluntarily withdraw a drug or do not reapply for a marketing licence, they must specifically declare if this is due to a safety concern.

The amendments which I supported plug gaps in the legislation in the form of a lack of evaluation of medicines once they have been authorised, their withdrawal without automatic notification of all EU Member States, the absence of evaluation and the lack of transparency surrounding withdrawal. The safety of medicines is a massive issue. We want informed patients helping health professionals with pharmacovigilance. The amendments which I supported (activation of the urgency procedure, clarification of transparency obligations for pharmaceutical companies and re-registration of suspect medicines in the list of medicinal products following additional monitoring) are designed to plug any gaps that may undermine the safety of medicines and the protection of public health.</p>

These rules are only envisaged for ports in the North and Baltic Seas, while throughout the world, ships are allowed to use fuel oil containing 4.5% sulphur. This tightening of fuel quality requirements will make the situation difficult for maritime transport carriers because it will increase fuel costs as well as transportation prices. As a result, there may be a significant reduction in the amount of freight transported by sea and an increase in the amount carried by road throughout Northern and Eastern Europe.

      <p sl="fr">The updating of the legislation on the reduction of the sulphur content of marine gas oils, which was finally approved by MEPs this Tuesday in Strasbourg, will put a further brake on pollution from ships in all of the EU’s seas. In fact, we ratified by a large majority (606 votes to 55, with 13 abstentions) the provisional agreement reached by the Council on the proposal aiming to reduce emissions of sulphur particles from ships (Directive 93/12/EEC). According to this text, the maximum sulphur content of marine gas oils used in designated Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) (the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel) will be reduced from 1.5% to 1% by 31 December 2014 and to 0.1% from 1 January 2015. The maximum content of 0.5% will be compulsory in all EU seas by 2020 and will also apply to all passenger ships operating outside the SECAs, and so on. State aid may be provided to avoid the negative impact on the sector’s competitiveness due to the investment costs inherent in these new requirements. I welcome this move.</p>

It is important to control these values, since the atmospheric pollution caused by ships is currently estimated to be responsible for around 50 000 premature deaths in Europe. Sulphur and nitrogen oxides release into the air secondary particles harmful to health. Reducing emissions from ships will make it easier to achieve air quality standards in a number of Member States. However, it is important to take into consideration that, during the transition period, some operators will have to bear significant additional costs, particularly in the case of journeys made in Sulphur Emission Control Areas. I am also very much in favour of the exception for islands and the outermost regions from the 0.5% sulphur limit applicable from 2015 to all maritime areas of the EU and all vessels. As a result of their natural characteristics, a limited number of passenger vessels offering regular services have a five-year period, until 2020, to adapt to the legislation, thereby reducing the negative impact.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This proposal for a directive is intended to implement the upper limits on the sulphur content of marine fuels. Given the atmospheric pollution caused by vessels and its consequences in terms of public health, not just for coastal cities with major ports where vessels dock, but also because sulphur dioxide causes acid precipitation and eutrophication in water and land areas, the Commission proposes that the new 0.1% sulphur limit for emission control areas should also apply to all passenger vessels regularly entering any EU port from 2020 onwards.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the rapporteur suggests that this be moved forward to 2015 and that the ceiling currently applicable to EU ports be extended to 12 nautical miles. We think the objectives guiding this legislation seem fair and the changes demanded necessary. We need to make available more funding, specifically from the EU budget, for investing in technology beneficial to the environment and to public health. Without prejudice to achieving this report’s objectives, we voted, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for a proposal aimed at safeguarding the specific characteristics of certain regions, such as the Autonomous Region of Madeira, by ensuring the necessary amendments to the rapporteur’s proposal.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The main purpose of the proposal is to implement the upper limits agreed in the IMO on the sulphur content of marine fuels. It is estimated that air pollutants from ships at present cause some 50 000 premature deaths per year in Europe. Reducing emissions from ships will make it easier to achieve air quality standards in many Member States. According to the estimate, the monetary value of the health benefits that can be achieved exceeds the costs of reducing marine emissions by a factor of between two and 25. The Commission estimates the monetary value of the health benefits at EUR 8-16 billion and the cost at EUR 0.6-3.7 billion. The directive will clarify and standardise the implementation and monitoring within the EU of the limits agreed in the IMO, and level the playing field for competition, facilitate the transition stage and encourage innovation. In addition, the lower sulphur limits should lead to significant improvements in European citizens’ health. A cost-benefit analysis drawn up by the Commission suggests that a maximum limit of 0.1% in the SECAs would prevent in excess of 17 000 premature deaths per year by 2020. There would also be substantial reductions in the occurrence of respiratory illnesses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Up until now, there have not been any limits for European maritime transport, which is very much in contrast to the other modes of transport such as rail, road and air transport. I therefore welcome the fact that we will have a scheme from now on.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it would have been desirable to have a uniform scheme for all of Europe instead of establishing stricter sulphur limits for ships which travel in SECAs (Sulphur Emission Control Areas). These apply only to the North and Baltic Seas and the English Channel. If we set different limits in different countries, this could lead to the migration of traffic from water to road. Sulphur-free fuel will become expensive and this will make the transport of goods by road more attractive. I am therefore very pleased that state grants for the shipping industry have been provided and that we have thereby counteracted a possible shift from sea to land transport.</p>
      <p sl="de">The present scheme concerns the implementation of the international MARPOL Convention. It is important to set international standards for modes of transport that have a strong international dimension, as in the case of maritime transport.

      <p sl="fr">The costs relating to the new standards on reduced sulphur emissions could have negative impacts on the sector’s competitiveness and lead to a switch from shipping to land-based transport. As a consequence, Member States will be able to grant aid to operators in accordance with the rules applicable to State aid. Ships that do not respect these new limits will be required to pay fines to national authorities. These fines must be high enough to ensure that it is not cheaper to pay them rather than to comply with the rules.</p>

The opinions of shipowners and equipment suppliers differ regarding the availability and reliability of scrubbers. In addition, everyone would wonder whether the new deadline might be postponed once more. This would further undermine investment in this technology. Those considering using LNG are faced with a chicken and egg situation: shipowners do not want to equip vessels so that they can use LNG without an assurance that supplies will be available in sufficient ports, while ports are equally reluctant to invest in view of uncertainties about demand. In spite of all these doubts, I welcome the provision that it is essential to find means of reducing ship emissions in many Member States because only then will we be able to contribute to improving air quality.</p>

      <p sl="fi">When I speak of the Sulphur Directive, it is as a representative of Finland and from my own country’s perspective. This is a wretched example of everything that can go wrong. The decision will mean an additional bill of billions of euro for our export industry, one that represents the peak of cleanliness in the global context. A mistake was made by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which allowed marine sulphur emission limits in the Mediterranean to be 45 times greater than those in the Baltic Sea, and now the directive is confirming that distortion of competition. The sulphur content of fuel in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel will drop from the current limit of 1% to 0.1% in 2015, while in the Mediterranean, a content of 4.5% will be permitted up until 2020. This is a particular blow for Finland, 90% of whose exports rely on shipping. The cost of sea freight will immediately rise in Finland by 30-50%. Given the current price of oil, that will mean a permanent additional annual cost of EUR 600 million, corresponding to 9 000 jobs a year. Globally too, Europe would be as much as 30 times more stringently regulated than the rest of the world for the next five to ten years.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If the EU were as good as its word, it would say that it was rejecting its position on decisions that create systematic distortion of competition for our markets. For the sake of comparison, I will take an example from the banking sector. Imagine, for example, the interest rate in Germany of 0.35%, which is what it has been for five years, at 45 times the amount: it would be 15.75%. Would this correspond to our concept of the level playing field? It does not matter how strict the limits are, as long as they apply to everyone. It is a mistake to create distortions of competition in legislation because it means environmental losses. The polluter then always has the competitive advantage. Most Finnish Members of the European Parliament wanted a transitional period for this directive and a clear signal sent to the IMO that the decision needs to be amended.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In voting on this report, I was influenced by several important issues, such as the introduction from 2015 of a maximum permitted sulphur content of 0.1% for marine fuels used in Sulphur Emission Control Areas – the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel. However, the countries of the Mediterranean are to be placed under these restrictions only in 2020. We are therefore creating a clear division between the countries of northern seas and southern seas, and are stifling competition in the European market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The data presented show that fuels which contain less sulphur are much more expensive. The environmental objectives which have been set may therefore not be achieved, because if sea transport becomes more expensive, it is very probable that land-based transport will become more popular. It is, of course, possible to fit ships with SOx scrubbers, but in view of the age of the shipping fleet and the economic situation of countries such as Poland, for example, fitting this equipment will be completely uneconomical.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An alternative to conventional fuels is the use of liquefied natural gas in ships. This can only apply to vessels which have come into service recently because of the technology involved.

According to experts, these measures are intended to considerably enhance air quality, especially in coastal areas. However, this transition will come with a high price tag for shipping companies and there is a risk that a share of shipping traffic could move to overland routes. This is in contrast, though, to another EU measure, namely, the one intended to ensure that more shipments are carried by water or rail than on the road. Coastal and inland ships consume much less fuel per transport unit and therefore emit less carbon dioxide than lorries. That is why the EU wants to move a third of the shipments currently transported by lorries over distances greater than 300 kilometres to rail or ship by 2030. Measures for cleaning exhaust gases similar to those used in factories located on land are now being considered for ships. This means that exhaust gas purification devices, or perhaps the use of liquefied gases, could be feasible options.

Excessively stringent environmental standards could instead reduce the competitiveness of European shipping and lead to an increase in the proportion of road transport. It is clear that this latter scenario would be much more harmful to our environment, since marine transport makes it possible to transport significantly more goods and passengers than can be transported by road or rail, there are no ‘traffic jams’ on sea lanes, and practically no funding or natural resources are required to maintain those lanes (apart from maritime signs and marine monitoring). In order to guarantee the development of European maritime shipping, it is essential that we simplify the granting of State aid for necessary environmental investment.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The revision of the directive has the main objective of implementing the IMO agreement from 2008 to reduce the sulphur content of fuels in specific Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) from 1.5% to 0.1% in 2015 and to introduce the global sulphur limit of 0.5% (from 3.5%) for all EU sea areas in 2020, or 2025, depending on the IMO. In addition, the more strict sulphur limit applicable for SECAs (Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel) was proposed to apply also to passenger ships on regular service between EU ports. Without further measures, the ship-based sulphur emissions would exceed all land-based pollution by 2020, with significant health impacts as well as contribution to acidification. Emissions from international ship traffic were responsible for approximately 50 000 premature deaths in Europe in 2000 and external costs related to human health corresponding to 7% of the total health costs in Europe. The implementation of the IMO agreement into EU law represents probably the most significant air quality improvement introduced during this legislative period.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Today’s vote on the permissible sulphur content of marine fuels is, overall, a major step towards improving air quality in the European coastal areas, considering that the pollution caused by ships could exceed land-based pollution as early as 2020. This directive incorporates in EU legislation the standards established by the International Maritime Organisation in 2008 with the aim of reducing the overall sulphur limit in European seas to 0.5%. However, I cannot give my full support to the new directive, as the new limit values envisage large differences in sulphur emission limits between various regions of Europe, giving rise to competitive imbalances not only within the shipping sector, but also with land transport. In the Sulphur Emission Control Areas, that is, in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel, there are already stricter standards in place than elsewhere in Europe; the sulphur content of fuels must not exceed 1% by mass up to 2015, and after that – 0.1%. Elsewhere, for example, in the Mediterranean Sea, the sulphur limit will have to be brought down from 3.5% to 0.5% by 2020. In the future, serious work will have to be done on standardising the permissible sulphur content of fuels throughout all European seas – setting it at the level established for the Baltic Sea.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The position of the Committee on Public Health and Food Safety on the sulphur content of marine fuels was clear. The objective was to introduce stricter sulphur emission limits in all sea areas in the European Union. The outcome of talks with the Council was that Parliament’s aims were not achieved. Finally, a decision was reached on sulphur emission limits that will cause an obvious distortion of competition in the EU’s internal market if they are implemented under this directive. Furthermore, the introduction of limits will cause immense economic damage, especially in the northernmost regions of the EU, especially as a result of this distortion of competition.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although I think that reducing sulphur emissions for reasons of health is something very worthwhile, I would have liked to see some attention being given in the outcome of negotiations to the fact that some Member States will have to bear a much greater burden than others with regard to these goals.

      <p sl="en">Air pollution from shipping is thought to be responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year in Europe, as well as for causing significant long-term environmental damage. I fully support this agreement, especially the more ambitious deadline of 2020 by which the new limits must be in force. It strikes the right balance between environmental protection, legal certainty, and a realistic target for operators. Regulating the maritime sector and creating a genuine level playing field for its operators is notoriously difficult. The international agreements made through the International Maritime Organisation are minimum standards, and we should strive to improve on them. As the Commission’s analysis shows, the health and environmental benefits of a 2020 deadline will be significant, and the sector will be encouraged – and helped – to make the necessary investments, resulting in a cleaner atmosphere and a healthier environment.</p>

      <p sl="et">The secondary particulates produced by sulphur and nitrogen oxides arising from air pollution from ships cause up to 50 000 premature deaths in Europe every year. Given the above, and in view of the agreement that is on the table today, it must be said that the objectives that were set have largely not been achieved. We need to set equal rates that apply to all of Europe’s seas, in order to guarantee clean air not only for Northern Europeans, but also for other coastal areas of Europe. It is also important to guarantee fair and equal competition in the transport sector, and to avoid the unequal treatment of shipping companies operating in different regions. The European Commission and the Member States should follow the example of the United States and Canada, which jointly established a sulphur monitoring area within 200 nautical miles of their entire coastlines, and they should set firm deadlines for establishing a pollution monitoring area covering the whole of Europe. Although I take a critical view of the agreement concluded between the Council and Parliament, I support the adoption of this report, because the indecision that has existed since 2008 must be brought to an end and all parties must be given a clear signal about the future.</p>

      <p sl="sv">In the vote today in Parliament on what is known as the Sulphur Directive, I voted for the compromise that has been reached. The particularly stringent rules that apply to sulphur emissions in the vulnerable seas in northern Europe (the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel) mean that, as a result of higher freight costs, many of the industries in Sweden and other northern European countries suffer a major competitive disadvantage compared with the rest of Europe, where higher limit values for sulphur emissions apply. Reducing sulphur emissions in our seas is absolutely essential from an environmental perspective, and it is something that all 27 EU Member States have already committed to doing by signing the MARPOL Convention and Annex VI thereto. In my opinion, it would have been better if the seas around all the EU Member States were covered by the same low limit values for sulphur emissions as the seas in northern Europe. In that way, not only would competition be more equal and the internal market more integrated, but the water and air along all of the EU’s coasts would also be cleaner.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Control of the sulphur content in marine fuels for all maritime vessels, including passenger vessels, should take into account the negative impact that this can have on local populations, particularly the residents of the outermost regions and islands. That is why there is an exception for islands and the outermost regions from the 0.5% sulphur limit applicable from 2015 to all maritime areas of the EU and all vessels. As a result of their natural characteristics, a limited number of passenger vessels offering regular services have a five-year period, until 2020, to adapt to the legislation, thereby reducing the negative impact. The Member States’ international commitments, not least to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), already provided for this limitation. However, these changes should be gradual and tailored to the specific characteristics of the island regions, and should simultaneously cover increased support for operators. At the same time, the process of establishing Emission Control Areas should be subject to the procedures of the IMO, the only body with authority in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on the sulphur content of marine fuels. With this directive, the EU is making provision for a reduction in the sulphur content of ship emissions to 0.1% by 2015 in the Baltic Sea, the English Channel and the North Sea. It therefore transposes into EU law an obligation required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which was difficult to ignore. The 2015 deadline, however, seems very premature given the economic and technical constraints that it will impose, especially on passenger shipping. The fear is that some ships will have to be withdrawn from the fleets, as there will be no way of adapting them to the new requirements, leading to the loss of hundreds of jobs in an economic context where passenger transport companies are facing difficulties. Negotiations in Parliament have, however, allowed us to confirm that State aid would be authorised to support the operators in this transition. There is also a reminder that Member States can still approach the IMO for an extension to deadlines to allow their fleets to be fitted out within the deadlines. These different safeguard measures have led me to approve the transposition of the European Union’s international obligations in this directive.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on reducing the sulphur content of certain marine fuels because applying the new provisions will help cut environmental pollution caused by burning marine fuels with a high sulphur content. In order to achieve the targets laid down in Directive 1999/32/EC on reducing the sulphur content of certain marine fuels, the obligations concerning the sulphur content of marine fuels need to be properly enforced.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that a more effective system is needed for monitoring and enforcing the sulphur content obligations in order to ensure that the directive is implemented properly. Adhering to the lower sulphur content limits for marine fuels may lead to a significant price hike. This is why appropriate solutions are needed to reduce the costs resulting from compliance, which are incurred by the industries concerned, such as authorising alternative, more cost-effective means of compliance.</p>

Obviously, there is a need to combat pollution from transport and reduce its environmental footprint across all means of transport. Not at any price, however. We must not place excessive restrictions on shipowners and customers that would damage the competitiveness and economic viability of the sector, which already faces strong competition. I had put forward the need to include accompanying measures as a corollary to the reduction in sulphur rates from shipping. The Commission must now propose how the toolbox that it has announced will be deployed in practice. I shall be watching this issue extremely closely. The EU is the leading maritime power and the world leader in the fight for the environment, proof, if it were required, that transport and sustainability are not incompatible, quite the contrary.

The introduction of a sulphur limit of 0.1% for all vessels engaging in regular passenger transport, together with the extension of the limit to territorial waters, will result in significant additional costs that will have to be borne by the entities affected by this restriction.

      <p sl="lv">Limits on sulphur emissions from marine fuels are necessary in order to reduce air pollution caused by ships, particularly in coastal areas. As the EU Member States in the International Maritime Organisation have agreed to stricter standards in Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), it is clear that the EU’s regulations must now be aligned with its international obligations. However, due attention should be given to ensuring fair competition in the shipping sector. Unfortunately, the new directive, on which Parliament and the Council have reached agreement, will still allow for significant differences in the permitted sulphur emission levels in different regions of the EU. I cannot support this directive because it will not ensure equal treatment of all Member States within the EU common market. Differing limits in different European coastal waters create competitive disadvantages for shipping companies in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel, compared both with the same kind of companies in other areas and with land transport. In the future, work should be done on standardising the limits of sulphur emissions from fuels in all coastal waters of the EU. In order to ensure fair competition, the sulphur emission standards should be made as equal as possible – both in SECAs and in other European sea basins. Support for such a position was obtained in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety also took a similar stance. To avoid damaging the EU’s overall competitiveness, it should be done internationally within the International Maritime Organisation by expanding and marking new SECAs.</p>

I hope that the resistance of some States is overcome, as I believe this regulation is fair, since it guarantees a compromise between consolidating the single market and the requirements of businesses operating in the sector.</p>

This new proposal can be commended in its attempts to streamline the current wine regime through small-scale simplification of the CAP and by reducing the administrative burden.

      <p sl="fr">The Commission is proposing that Member States grant decoupled support to vine growers under the direct payments scheme. In practical terms, that will allow Member States to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the common agricultural policy (CAP) direct payments scheme (first pillar). That is positive, as the payments will now be granted for an indefinite period, which will allow small farmers to predict their incomes over the period and therefore gain stability. The introduction of this mechanism will, however, require some adjustments. This resolution will allow Member States to test this new mechanism for a period of one year prior to its definitive implementation, if they so desire.

Even more importantly, the amendment has to be seen in the light of the new CAP proposal for direct payments (Article 25) which, on the one hand, provides for vine growers to obtain payment entitlements for wine areas – while still being allowed to benefit from the wine programme measures as before – and, on the other hand, does not allow the amounts transferred from the wine envelopes to be allocated just to the vine growers.

      <p sl="pl">The reform of the common agricultural policy has been the central issue occupying the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development during this parliamentary term. We are currently working on the European Commission’s proposals through discussions on the direction of change and on experts’ suggestions, but also by listening to our citizens, especially to our farmers. All indications, however, point to the fact that no final decisions will be made this year. This is because doubts still remain with regard to many issues and further debates and many compromises will be required before satisfactory solutions can be developed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In relation to vine growers, however, the European Commission proposes that Member States support farmers using funds under the single payment scheme and not, as is currently the case, under support programmes in the vine sector. The decision regarding the transfer of funds must be final and must be made by 1 December 2012. In view of the reform and the ‘transitional’ nature of the year 2013, the final year of the current financing period for the common agricultural policy, this measure seems very unfavourable to all interested parties. I strongly support the solution proposed in the document to make a one-off reduction to the structure of the current support programme by cutting it from five years to one year, and to postpone the deadline for making the final decision until such time as the framework of the future agricultural policy becomes known.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It would, however, be dangerous to include the wine envelope in the single payment scheme, for several reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The special nature of the wine sector will be further diluted in the single common market organisation (CMO).</p>

In the context of the fundamental changes in the EU’s common agricultural policy, I consider it necessary to proceed with caution and, at the same time, with flexibility in adopting changes to the legal regime in the wine sector, since reform of the common agricultural policy may bring many significant modifications and only make conditions for vine growers more opaque. In order to ensure certainty and predictability for vine growers, I think it right to allocate funds for the single payment scheme so that the individual amounts are known in advance.

      <p sl="fr">At a time when our Parliament is laying down future markers for our main policies, we are discussing the issue of the model of support for vine growers. Thus, by 2015, Member States will have to choose between the single payment scheme that applies to all farmers and the mobilisation of dedicated funds for vine growers, which previously they could accumulate. I obviously supported this measure, which I think is the best way of recognising the special nature of the profession of vine grower and to provide appropriate aid, against a background of change in the sector. France has already made its choice, as it basically uses the specific support scheme for vine growers. This reform then will not disrupt the French wine sector, but it will have the advantage of guaranteeing more transparency and greater predictability of the amounts and nature of the aid distributed. I welcome the adoption of this report, which also allows me to remind people of my attachment to planting rights.

This report is intended to make the internal market run more smoothly by creating a more effective tool that is easier to use, so as to facilitate administrative cooperation and information exchange. This proposal goes much further with the amendments by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which ensure that there are more limitations on how personal data are used, thereby protecting the public, as well as ensuring the proper implementation of the new provisions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At the same time, the European Union’s economic and political development depends on expanding its relations with its external partners.

In August 2011, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation, which would establish a single legal framework for the IMI system together with a set of rules to ensure that it functions effectively. Generally speaking, IMI is described as a flexible tool which it will be possible to apply widely. The new system in a consolidated form will contribute to better data protection and will make it possible for the relevant authorities to communicate quicker and cover more policy areas. It is also very important to consider the period for the retention of personal data that has already been adopted and whether the new period proposed is compatible with national legislation on data protection.

      <p sl="sv">The Internal Market Information System (IMI) is an extremely important instrument for the internal market. When authorities cooperate via the IMI, it helps to ensure the correct implementation of internal market rules and increased mobility for citizens and companies in the EU. At a time of crisis, a well-functioning internal market really is the highway to more growth, competitiveness and jobs in Europe. The IMI system for administrative cooperation between national authorities has existed since 2008 but, up to now, it has lacked a legal framework. I welcome the fact that we have gathered existing practice together in a single text, which increases transparency and legal certainty. At the same time, we have simplified procedures and increased the protection of personal data. One of the things that I have worked hard to promote is the principle that data should not be stored in the system any longer than necessary, but that it must also be possible for a person to request access to his or her own data for special purposes relating to the provision of proof, even after a case has been closed. As the representative for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I have worked to ensure that we have a safe, cost-effective, flexible and user-friendly system.

      <p sl="hu">In the present state of the harmonisation of European laws, there are considerable differences in national administrative procedures and national laws on data protection.

At the same time, data subjects must be assured that their data will enjoy consistent protection regardless of whether the data will be forwarded through IMI to other Member States. Ensuring consistency while respecting diversity is a fundamental challenge for the establishment of both the technical and the legal infrastructure of IMI.

I agree with Mr Bielan, who expressed his regret regarding the fact that the amendment to the proposal had been made with no impact assessment nor sufficient justification for the necessity of such a provision.

Among other things, this means that there must be a good translation function, so that the system is not just tailored to the current IMI system, but can also be expanded to incorporate future legislation. We were successful in getting the Commission to accept that they must always make satisfactory translation functionality available. I was also very concerned about data protection for the citizens and enterprises if data is exchanged through IMI.

This makes the IMI nothing more than an instrument created to consolidate and develop the single market, which we would criticise. Data protection is also one of the greatest concerns raised by this report: opening up the IMI to external actors could jeopardise the security and protection of personal data, and it could make this system accessible to the private sector. Furthermore, the Commission is not explicit about establishing maximum periods for holding on to personal data under the IMI: it takes the view that retention periods should not go further than is necessary for achieving the purposes of the regulation, which leaves the way open for holding on to these data for an unspecified length of time.</p>

Cross-border interest and royalty payments are taxed more heavily than domestic transactions. When transactions are purely national, the recipient of the payment is subject to corporate tax in the country of residence for tax purposes. In the case of European payments, they may also be subject to deductions at source in the Member State making the payment. The purpose of the directive is to place cross-border interest and royalty payments on an equal footing with domestic payments, by eliminating double taxation, burdensome administrative formalities and cash-flow problems for the companies concerned.</p>

Therefore, this Council directive aims to ensure greater harmonisation between the rates paid within and between different Member States, thereby eliminating certain problems like double taxation, tax avoidance fraud and the possibility of unintended non-taxation, since these cause great damage to the smooth running of the internal market. The Commission is also being called on to set a minimum level for taxes paid by companies within the EU, taking into account factors such as tax competitiveness among certain countries and in such a way as not to harm the sustainable consolidation of the Member States’ national budgets.

This situation is aggravated by the fact that, despite the major ongoing effort to strengthen coordination between Member States on their own budgets, conclusive action to coordinate tax systems is still excluded from political debate, especially in respect of the direct taxation system. This delay produces tax competition that could also be construed as dumping, which has a negative impact, especially on the stability of businesses, including geographically, and risks, above all, affecting areas that are already weak and corporate social responsibility.

It will also be difficult for those countries that want to keep a relatively high level of taxation to actually do so. Consequently, we feel that it is worth holding a proper debate on limiting or putting a stop to this tax competition.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, we cannot support the establishment of a minimum level for corporate taxes. This would entail the EU getting involved in an area – direct taxation – in which the starting point has to be that the Member States take the decisions entirely on their own.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The subject of this Council Directive (2003/49/EC) is a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different Member States. It puts forward the goal of preventing the double taxation of income. This can be achieved in two ways: taxing income in the Member State where it is produced or in that country where the registered office of the beneficiary company is located. The aim of this proposal is to tax interest and royalties in the Member State where the recipient company has its registered office. It is well-known that associated companies, which are often sister companies within a single umbrella organisation, have a number of mechanisms available to them to reduce taxes on their profits, particularly by manipulating the prices of goods or services that they trade with one another. They use these methods to transfer profits to where they are taxed least. Article 1(1) states that interest and royalty payments are exempt from any taxes imposed in the Member State where they are generated, provided that their beneficial owner is a company of another Member State or a permanent establishment situated in another Member State. That is the case whether or not the company is associated with the payer company.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Council directive on a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of the different Member States has been amended several times in recent years.

The loss of revenues raises the deficit and debt levels of the different Member States. Cooperation between the tax systems of the different Member States is increasingly desirable.

It is important to note, however, that in tax-related matters, the final decision still lies with the Member States, and that the principle of subsidiarity applies. Still, complex matters that sometimes affect several Member States, such as the system of interest and royalty payments, require a European framework that applies uniform considerations and jointly agreed criteria to ensure, as regards Member States, that taxes are settled in a transparent manner and within a regulated framework. Thus, the report discusses important issues and seeks to further limit the opportunities for tax evasion, double non-taxation and tax fraud, and is therefore worthy of support.</p>

However, it does not draw every consequence there is to draw from it. Whilst it refuses to reduce the holding requirements to 10% for a company to be treated as an associated company of another company, it nonetheless maintains a very low tax rate for the companies concerned (70% of the average statutory corporate tax rate applicable in the Member States, in other words, scarcely 16.24%; it is much less than the VAT rates that the Troika imposes on the people of Europe).

The Portuguese people have experienced this at first hand, with the implementation of the aggression pact of the two troikas: the IMF, ECB and Commission, and the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS), the Portuguese Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Democratic and Social Centre – People’s Party (CDS-PP). This integration process, which is ever more dominated by Germany, is clearly intended to serve the profits of big business.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The crisis in the EU will only be overcome on the basis of principled and fair actions. Europe must remain true to the social market economy model guaranteeing sustainable growth in order to secure jobs and a better quality of life for the current and future generations. Cohesion and solidarity are among the main objectives of the EU, as is confirmed by Article 174 TFEU. The European Commission needs an ambitious work programme for 2013 focusing on the promotion of sustainable growth, the creation of jobs, the quality of life in Europe, and the restoration of the confidence of citizens in European integration. The Commission should demonstrate that it is a strong leader by providing proper political solutions to the crisis, guaranteeing and asserting the correct EU institutional balance, and ensuring that the common European interest prevails over incompatible national interests.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The challenges faced by the European Union call for decisive and determined action from the Commission, so that we might finally lift ourselves out of this crisis and find our way back onto the path to growth and solidarity. It is in view of this call for decisive action, which, above all, takes into account the needs of the most vulnerable, that I voted in favour of this resolution. The rise in extremism, euroscepticism and populist discourse should, in particular, alert us to the truly serious state in which we find Europe today, and to the crisis of legitimacy that has grabbed the attention of our fellow citizens. The same applies when we see the return of an intergovernmental logic, which is creeping onto the negotiating table. Therefore, the time for talking is over and it is now time for concrete action. Through this, we are demanding that the Common European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies becomes a legally binding instrument rather than simply an empty shell. By having the courage to face these challenges, Europe will be able to regain the trust of our fellow citizens.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The continuing crisis in the euro area still poses a threat to all European Union Member States. Furthermore, the European Union faces a profound competitiveness crisis, whereas most other regions of the world are growing more quickly, with increasing levels of productivity and innovation, and will leave the European Union trailing behind unless decisive action is taken. The Commission should therefore seek as a priority to devote its energies and resources to supporting the Member States so they can deal with this crisis effectively and swiftly, while reducing bureaucracy and centralisation. I therefore believe that the 2013 Work Programme for the last full year of the current Commission’s term of office must prioritise more targeted and specific initiatives that would stimulate real growth and improve competitiveness.

      <p sl="sv">I would like to use this explanation of vote to explain why it is necessary for the Commission to look into this matter further. I strongly uphold the free movement of persons on the EU’s internal market as a fundamental right for all EU citizens, but I see a need to examine the relationship between different legislative instruments in order for it to work in the best way possible. After all, the Free Movement Directive grants EU citizens the right to reside in another EU Member State for a period longer than three months without working if the person has sufficient resources to not be considered a burden on the country’s social assistance system and has sickness insurance. In several EU Member States, however, a person who is not working nevertheless has the right to various social security benefits. The Commission’s proposal can be read in such a way that a person who is not working and who has been granted a social security benefit (which is not linked to gainful employment) can be considered to have resources so that he/she is not considered to constitute a burden on the Member State’s social assistance system and thus meet the requirements for the right of residence. In practice, this means that a person is first examined to see if he/she has the right to social security benefits (regulation on the coordination of social security systems) and then whether he/she has the right to residence (directive on the free movement of persons). From a purely logical point of view, it should be the other way around and the right to residence should be examined before granting social security benefits.</p>

Although it enhances all the main relevant issues that the EC needs to take into account for its work programme, I regret that some concrete measures proposed by my group, the EPP, were not included in the final document. A binding calendar for implementing the remaining legislation regarding the single market is essential. Clear deadlines and, should they be breached, fast-track infringement procedures should motivate Member States to finally comply with the EU legislation needed to fully integrate the single market. This means full enforcement and the removal of any remaining obstacles to the free circulation of goods, services, persons and capital. Our rhetoric must be imperative: obligations and commitments have to be fulfilled. Secondly, the future of research and innovation has been left out. The future Horizon 2020 is crucial for generating a knowledge-based economy and society that can compete in the global arena. In this regard, widening the participation of industry should be a priority. Also, there must be serious efforts to bridge the gap in the field of R&amp;I between newer and older Member States to avoid larger divides than those that already exist at present.</p>

Robust international trade, investment and market integration are key drivers therefore of strong sustainable and balanced growth. The resolution stresses the importance of open markets and a fair, strong, rules-based trading system and insists on the need for protectionist measures to be refrained from worldwide as a basic condition for fair competition.

A residual monetary union would certainly be preferable to the current situation, not least because, in this constellation, the traditional hard currency countries of the former Deutsche Mark block would be in a corresponding majority and could therefore formulate an appropriate monetary policy. However, because of international pressure on Germany, we are still not seeing any of this long-needed downsizing. It is clear to see that Germany is either too weak, too dispirited or, for other reasons, reluctant to take steps that would not only be reasonable, but which are also desired by a large majority of its own population. It is now time that we stopped further financial injections to ailing EU Member States. Considering that the European Union is facing a profound competition crisis and that most other regions in the world are achieving much faster growth and higher productivity, as well as a higher degree of innovation, leaving the European Union to trail behind if no decisive countermeasures are taken, I voted against this resolution because it has failed to steer us away from the wrong path that we have been down before.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I gave my support to the Commission Work Programme for 2013. There are issues, however, which require particular attention. In social terms, the issues in question involve, firstly, the battle against unemployment, especially among young people, and secondly, the resolution of the problem of poverty, which is spreading across the EU. There is also the issue of promoting social integration and inclusion. In terms of gender equality, particular consideration should be given, first of all, to the implementation and supervision of the gender consideration process in legislative and budgetary procedures, in the Lisbon strategy, and in job creation programmes. Secondly, we need to consider the development of a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating violence against women. Thirdly, we need to consider the elimination of remuneration differences between women and men, and lastly, the development of integration and migration policy from a gender perspective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Implementation of EU law must be improved and measures put forward in relation to various proposals on blocked directives, such as, for example, the EU Anti-Discrimination Directive. I also appeal to the Council to ensure the effective inclusion of the issue of human rights and democracy in external policy. It is important that in the case of a blatant violation of human rights by a Member State, the EU should take bolder measures in relation to imposing sanctions provided for in agreed clauses on human rights, including the possibility of a temporary suspension of an agreement.

      <p sl="hu">The report explores current Member State trends in the voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells and makes recommendations in order to improve the quality of life for people throughout Europe and increase the flow of donations between Member States. It lays down the basic principle that donations must be voluntary and carried out on a non-profit basis in a transparent environment. The report gives particular focus to the donation of cord blood necessary for the extraction of stem cells, as there is increasingly solid proof that stem cells can be used to treat diseases, including children’s illnesses. At the same time, the report concludes that despite all this, stem cells from cord blood are only stored at 1% of total births in the EU. The report therefore encourages mothers to donate cord blood and tissue to public or private banks when giving birth, urges information campaigns, expects each Member State to establish at least one public bank for cord blood, encourages private and public cell banks to engage in close cooperation in order to increase the availability and exchange of cord blood and tissue at both national and EU level, and stresses the importance of the establishment of, and compliance with, EU-level standards for both private and public cell banks.

This report, which expresses the point of view of MEPs, is in no way a legislative text aimed at regulating a sensitive area over which Member States have sole jurisdiction. In France, the Bioethics Law was revised in 2011. In this report, we restate that donations should remain voluntary and be carried out on a non-profit basis. We also call upon Member States to ensure the fullest transparency in this area. Finally, we encourage the donation and collection of umbilical cord blood, which is useful for transplantation. With regard to sensitive issues relating to embryonic stem cell research, in-vitro fertilisations or cloning using stem cells for investigative purposes, we state that such issues are best decided upon at Member State level.</p>

Yet too few mothers are asked by midwives to donate umbilical cord blood during childbirth. Member States should strive to ensure that umbilical cord blood is no longer considered hospital waste, but a real resource for research. Public and private umbilical cord and stem cell banks should cooperate more effectively.

I agree entirely with the condition that the removal of tissues and cells for the benefit of recipients may only be carried out under two conditions: it must be done with a medical or scientific and therapeutic aim, and all the elements removed must be donated without any payment being made. It is essential to avoid any practices that are at odds with ethics when removing tissues or cells, and this should only be carried out by professionals in the field. I believe that a few things can be singled out in order to avoid non-transparent donation. Firstly, public awareness raising – publicity campaigns ensuring clear and scientifically based information for donors and recipients, from consenting to donation to the consequences of transplantation. Secondly, traceability must be ensured from donor to patient, while maintaining anonymity and applying the highest standards of quality of tissues and cells for transplantation, particularly in the case of third countries. The European Commission also has a special role to play in monitoring the morally sensitive donation system, based on the implementation of the principles of anonymity and volunteerism.

Good practices already being applied in certain Member States, such as Great Britain, illustrate that this is the right approach.

      <p sl="fr">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe abstained from voting on the resolution proposed by Ms Yannakoudakis on the donation of human tissues and cells, which focuses, in particular, on the areas of non-remuneration and anonymity. While the Commission reminded us, during the debate, about finding the right balance between respect for fundamental principles and the availability of tissues and cells, Parliament has added hurdles to an already tricky situation. Fourteen Member States suffer from regular shortages, notably for bone marrow transplants and donations of gametes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nothing justifies, as set out in the resolution, European requirements for private tissue and cell banks. In the same way, the will of the conservative forces in Parliament to change existing legislation on advanced therapy medicinal products should be condemned: it calls on pro-life movements to stop a whole sector of research, from tissue engineering (skin, cardiac valves) to somatic cell therapy (used primarily in cancer research).</p>
      <p sl="fr">As rapporteur for the ALDE Group, I am disappointed that Parliament has refused to take a humanist, open approach to medical research: the only approach that would allow the expectations of European patients to be met.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The principles governing tissue and cell donation are set out in Article 12 of Directive 2004/23/EC: ‘Member States shall endeavour to ensure voluntary and unpaid donations of tissues and cells. Donors may receive compensation, which is strictly limited to making good the expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. In that case, Member States define the conditions under which compensation may be granted’. Donated tissues and cells, such as skin, bones, tendons, corneas and haematopoietic stem cells, are increasingly used in medical therapies and as starting material for advanced therapy medicinal products. In addition, reproductive cells are used in the field of medically assisted reproductive technology, e.g. in vitro fertilisation. The most controversial issue concerned cord blood donations into private cord blood banks. We wanted to introduce critical wording about private cord banks for potential autologous treatment, as the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits making the human body and its parts a source of financial gain, yet private cord blood banks clearly have a commercial interest. We did not succeed in that, but managed to avoid any explicit promotion of private cord blood banks. We also managed to get rid of statements which tried to state that benefits in kind would not necessarily violate the principle of altruism.</p>

I want to stress the importance of giving the right information to parents so they can make informed choices about the collection and, in particular, the storage of cord blood. Whilst fully exploring the potential of this area of medicine and promoting the collection of cord blood for the mutual benefit of everyone, we must be sure that the information given about the potential uses of cord blood is consistent with scientific knowledge and not unproven speculation.

      <p sl="pt">This report makes a number of recommendations on the voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells to complement existing practices in Member States, which have exclusive competence in this area. Donations are intended to be voluntary and carried out on a non-profit basis, in a transparent and safe environment; limited compensation for covering expenses incurred is allowed. The proposals only concern multiple tissues, reproductive cells and non-reproductive cells. In-vitro fertilisation, cloning using stem cells for investigative purposes and embryonic stem cell research fall outside the scope of this report. The rapporteur calls on Member States to pay attention to the existence of websites selling tissues and cells, and to the parallel market that could emerge therefrom.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on voluntary and unpaid donation of tissue and cells. I think that it is important that all Member States clearly define the conditions under which fair and proportionate financial compensation may be granted, bearing in mind that compensation is strictly limited to covering the expenses incurred in donating tissue and cells. Member States must adopt measures to protect living donors and guarantee that donation is anonymous (except in the case of harvesting from a living person for a relative), voluntary, freely consented to, informed and unpaid.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States need to step up their public information and awareness campaigns to promote the donation of tissue and cells and to ensure that medical information is provided which is clear, fair, scientifically based and conclusive, as well as data which enables the public to make an informed choice.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that it is important to establish rules for ensuring the traceability of tissue and cells of human origin from donor to patient and vice versa, as well as a system for regulating imports of human tissue and cells from third countries, thereby ensuring that equivalent quality and safety standards will apply.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This motion for a resolution lays the foundations for future regulations on the donation of tissues and cells. In particular, it reasserts the necessary principles of non-remuneration and anonymity for all donations of tissues and cells. With regard to stem cells becoming one of the great hopes for modern medicine, a clear stance on the subject is essential. The establishment of a regulatory framework would allow both donors and recipients to be safeguarded. Yet this resolution paves the way for the creation of private tissue and cell banks in which individuals would be able to stockpile their own cells and tissues. In practice, anonymous cord blood is 100 times more used and transplanted. There is therefore a gaping hole with regard to personal protection (which, after all, is selfish), which is nothing but detrimental for anonymous donations. It is for this reason that I abstained from voting on this motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In my view, the Yannakoudakis report is extremely important at this point in time, when the demand for organs, blood and bone marrow is increasing and the advance of medical science allows for their optimum use in saving human lives. Awareness of, and confidence in, public institutions which collect information and biological data regarding potential donors are key to reducing the gap between supply and demand of transplant material. This will certainly limit the trade in tissue and cells and reduce ‘transplant tourism’. Clear rules in relation to compensation and medical care provided for donors will also guarantee the comfort and safety of those who decide to help save the lives of others.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also strongly emphasise the ethical aspect of voluntary donation and call on the European Commission and the Member States to guarantee broader access to information regarding transplantation and donation. In my view, regardless of the systems used in individual Member States for the donation of organs, tissue or post mortem cells, whether based on informed or presumed consent, the Member States and the Commission should undertake a comprehensive information campaign aimed at promoting the declaration of consent among EU citizens. This declaration would be a clear signal to doctors and family members of a person’s willingness to become a donor after death.</p>

When creating a green economy, it is therefore important not to harm nature and for resources to be fairly distributed, irrespective of gender, race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability or beliefs. Men and women need to be equally involved in making political and economic decisions because democracy is based on those elected representing the entire population. Countries must take all appropriate measures to achieve a gender balance and to ensure women’s interests are considered in the same way as men’s interests. We must take into account the fact that natural resources are limited, as well as the fact that production and consumption results in emissions that eventually end up in the ecosystem. The prudent use of natural resources is therefore important for preventing negative environmental outcomes. This means the need to move towards the scenario of a green economy. Gender equality is part of what we mean by a green and sustainable economy. It is very important to make the role played by women visible and women should have time left to participate in social development.</p>

It is unacceptable that a number of Member States continue to undervalue the role of women in the green economy, resulting in numerous discriminations in terms of lost benefits, such as social protection, health care insurance, adequate salaries and pension rights. We urgently need to move towards a green economy in which environmental requirements should be intrinsically associated with social sustainability, particularly as regards increasing social justice, with a fair distribution of resources among individuals, men and women, and among generations.

To address this imbalance, countries should take all appropriate measures, including the introduction of quotas, to achieve a more balanced representation of the sexes in politics and the green economy.

In developed, industrialised countries, only 8-12% of the workforce is being employed in the 10-15 industries that are responsible for 70-80% of all carbon dioxide emissions. If policies aiming at the greening of existing companies and the promotion of employment are adopted, it is likely that only a fraction of these people will lose their jobs. I find the objectives set in the report extremely important, and I therefore supported the report with my vote.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this report because I believe that it is essential to examine the role of women in a sustainable economy. Why? Because women are on the front line today and the devastating effects of the environmental crisis have taken a particularly heavy toll on them. We must remember that the crisis affects, in particular, women in rural areas, impoverished by soil degradation, women in large cities, who are forced to maintain a pace of life that is not compatible with respect for human rights and who are exploited in degrading conditions, and women and their children who have been displaced as a result of conflicts or climate imbalances. Even now, women are all too often excluded from sustainable development policies even though they play a crucial role in maintaining an agricultural environment that preserves biodiversity and strengthening social cohesion through their collective organisational practices. Women have solutions to get us out of these crises; we must stop ignoring them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Eco-industry and environment-related industries – a significant and quickly growing portion of the EU economy currently representing 2.1% of EU GDP – offer an important and continuously expanding opportunity to enhance labour market participation, both in high-skill and low-skill sectors. Eco-industries and related services – including air pollution control, waste water management, solid waste management, soil remediation, renewable energies, and recycling – sustain 3.5 million full-time jobs at present and around 75%. Unfortunately, there is a disturbing lack of reliable, comprehensive and comparable data on how the green economy influences the labour market, especially from the aspect of its impact on equal opportunities and equality. The European Commission and national statistical authorities must therefore develop a proper disaggregated database and set of indicators to measure the actual and potential impact of the green economy on territorial and social cohesion. Furthermore, a set of strategic recommendations and policy instruments needs also to be defined in order to effectively respond to the possible changes in the level and/or structure of employment.</p>

It is clear that environmental policy has a direct impact on people’s health and socio-economic status, and that gender inequality, combined with a lack of sensitivity about the needs of women and the economic and social disparities they face, often leads women to suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation and inadequate policies in this regard.

This fact calls into question the legitimacy of today’s democratically-based decision-making bodies. I would say that at the present time, full of economic uncertainty, deepening climate change and collapsing ecosystems, access for women to world markets should be facilitated. One thing is indisputable. The approach of women to the pressing problems of today is diametrically opposite to the ‘masculine’ way of dealing with stalemates. Women are more inclined towards economical and efficient decisions. I often see how the role of women in the home, workplace and community is undervalued. Women always think first of the needs of their children and families, securing health care, education … On the other hand, they favour greater political stability and strongly oppose armed conflict. Let us therefore also exploit the potential of women in the green economy. A balanced approach to both sexes will bring alternative and innovative perspectives to the future. Growing demand for professional workers, however, also requires the appropriate training. Let us therefore give women and female students the same opportunities of access to education and training. I believe that only in this way will it be possible to make progress in research, sustainable development, and environmentally viable solutions to the present crises.</p>

Economic development in a green economy therefore takes place within the context of what nature can tolerate, and ensures a fair distribution of resources between people, between men and women, and between generations. The green economy means that the needs of the planet and of humans receive the highest priority and that the goal is to create sustainable societies that are energy efficient and healthy, and in which all people, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, colour, sexual orientation, disability or beliefs, may participate.</p>

In this area, women are, at the same time, the primary victims and real pioneers. We therefore have to give women and men the same opportunities to take action at a policy level and in relation to the economy, whose future also depends on green jobs. This report calls, in particular, on the Member States to develop action plans to encourage more women to choose courses and careers within sectors that will be the focus of many green jobs in the future (engineering, natural sciences, information technologies) but that are largely inaccessible to them at present.

We have to take this aspect into account when drawing up current public policies on both employment and education. We must make women’s jobs more secure and combat stereotypes from school age.

Sadly, certain stereotypes prevail in society, which cause the gender-specific division of labour. Some feel that there are female jobs and male jobs, and female jobs are usually associated with the home. Stereotypes also exist with the issue of flexibility and some still feel that caring for the home and family is women’s primary responsibility and that they should therefore accept working flexible hours, or doing temporary or casual work. On the other hand, it is crucial for women to reconcile professional and family life. The issue of equal pay is also very important because women in EU Member States now earn 17.1% less than men. Although current legal initiatives demand equal pay, the gap remains and progress on this issue is extremely slow. In its report ‘Gender Equality (2010)’, the European Commission emphasised that there are still inequalities in employment and expressed concern that the economic crisis is exacerbating the situation, as equality measures are being cut or eliminated.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Equal pay for women and men produces a ‘smart economy’, since the countries which create opportunities and good working conditions for women can increase productivity. To achieve the right balance between gender and professional qualifications, companies should adopt a flexible quota system for having women on boards of directors. Flexible quotas mean that each company will set its own percentage, selection procedure and deadline for reaching the quota.</p>

However, I fully support women’s rights and believe the equal contribution made by women and men to society must never be overlooked or taken for granted. I also believe that more must be done to close the pay gap between the sexes. However, wasting time and money on reports such as these actually undermines the sex equality fight rather than aids it. The report rather dramatically reveals that women tend to be disproportionately represented in the flexible and part-time employment market. I assume, without needing to have spent hundreds of thousands on a think tank, that this may have something to do with pregnancy and child care. All that the EU achieves in commissioning such reports is pointing out obvious differentiation between the sexes and then subsequently painting a portrait of women as martyrs, something which many forward-thinking feminists despise.</p>

In the EU, women earn 17.1% less than men, although the gender pay gap ranges between 3.2% and 30.9% in the Member States.

The situation of female migrant and undeclared workers in the services sector, in particular, those employed in private households, with the majority of them working without a contract in precarious employment and domestic service, in unsuitable working conditions, earning lower wages than declared workers and without any social rights, requires appropriate policies to be adopted to ensure that migrant workers enjoy basic human rights, including the right to health care, fair working conditions, education and training, physical and moral integrity and equality before the law.</p>

      <p sl="en">The service sector accounts for almost 70% of all jobs in the EU and is predominantly female. There is a tendency to stereotype jobs which associate women’s work with the more caring jobs e.g. nursing, caring, teaching, etc. These positions are often less well remunerated than traditional ‘men’s’ work. Women are disproportionately represented in the public sector and therefore can suffer disproportionately from budgetary cuts in the efforts to ensure fiscal consolidation. Therefore, it is important to have a strong gender dimension to Europe’s emerging growth and jobs strategies, including as regards ESF spending. I support efforts for a European Equal Pay Target to reduce the gender pay gap by 10% in each Member State. Gender pay differentials, currently at 16%, are transmitted into later generations in the form of lower pensions and higher poverty rates amongst older women. I look forward to the Commission proposal, due in November, on ratification of the ILO’s 2011 Domestic Workers Convention. This convention is also important in the context of the EU’s strategy to combat people trafficking.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The individualisation and ever increasing flexibility of the labour market in many Member States are putting employees, in particular women, who also have family obligations to meet, in a more vulnerable position, which can result in creating precarious jobs. There is a large proportion of women on the labour market employed in precarious jobs, and certain types of precarious jobs carried out by women, such as paid domestic work and providing care, are almost non-existent on the labour market. Under current legislation, there are, in this respect, large disparities in the European Union with regard to job opportunities and the quality of work, as well as in terms of receiving equal pay for doing the same work or work of the same value.</p>

      <p sl="pt">From halfway through the last century, modern societies have seen increased emancipation of women, essentially through an increase in their level of education, which has quickly outstripped that of men. In fact, 60% of university graduates are now women. It used to be said that a woman’s place was in the home; there are now many professions in which they are in the majority, for example, the service sector. In the EU, 69.4% of all jobs in this sector are occupied by women; this figure is as low as 5.2% for agriculture. Despite the trend at EU level towards the employment rates for men and women to move closer together, the truth is that many women still experience discrimination from their employers due to motherhood. That is why they mainly work flexible or part-time hours, which results in a wage disparity between the two genders. It is therefore crucial to eradicate gender inequality, so as to prevent any form of violence against women that affects all social, cultural and economic strata, since sexual harassment and abuse predominate in the service sector.</p>

It is very unfortunate that the employment of women in the service sector is still very much characterised by stereotypes in society that depict women’s main responsibility as being the family carer, with jobs that are seen as an extension of the work they do in the home, such as cleaning, teaching, clothing and textiles, etc. The jobs held by women are – for the most part – flexible, part-time, low-skilled jobs with notable wage gaps. In short, insecure jobs have almost become the norm and we cannot remain indifferent to that. It is in this context that the national and European authorities must demonstrate their commitment to combating these gender stereotypes, particularly from an early age. The issue of the employment – or, rather, the exploitation – of migrant women, especially in the area of domestic service and care work, also warrants the utmost attention of the public authorities.</p>

Similarly to the whole of the labour market, most of them face a gender pay gap, difficulties in reconciling work with family life, and the glass ceiling blocking their advancement. Unfortunately, precarious work is a persistent feature of the European Union’s labour market and women represent a great proportion of undeclared workers who are mainly engaged in domestic work and care.

Yet, despite this, we only rarely find them in management or decision-making positions in the services sector. Since women in the service sector are found in the lowest level jobs in terms of qualifications and wages, and are even paid less than men, I believe the training and knowledge of woman can be left to develop through the promotion of business activities and entrepreneurship of women.

This means they are paid lower wages, have less social protection, have greater limitations on the progress of their career, and have less opportunities for economic independence. This, in turn, encourages them to retreat into the private sphere and leads to steps backwards in responsibility sharing. Women account for a large proportion of those doing undeclared jobs. Using the excuse of labour reforms, the economic adjustments and social cuts that Member States such as Spain are making, as well as austerity measures, are weakening the rights of women working in this sector.

I voted in favour of this document, agreeing with the idea that there is still an unequal division of labour between men and women in specific sectors. Although the services sector creates a large proportion of jobs and revenue, it still pays the least. The payment of lower wages is possibly discriminatory, taking into account women’s responsibilities in the home and the possibility that they may stop working due to pregnancy. One of the major threats in this sector is illegal employment and its associated pay. Particular attention should therefore be paid to employers in the Member States’ services sector employing women part-time and paying inadequately for work, and to the exploitation of workers, particularly immigrants from third countries. Investment in training, more even distribution of rewards among both genders, and flexible working time arrangements, taking into account women’s responsibilities, are the main measures capable of improving the position of women and their working conditions in the services sector.</p>

The discrepancy between the representation of women in the public sector and the service sector continues to grow. Many women from disadvantaged groups have limited opportunities in the labour market. It should be noted that the working conditions and salaries are much lower than in other sectors. Another fact is that the problems associated with job insecurity tend to affect women more than men. The concentration of low-income, part-time work and other indicators is closely related to sexism in the workplace.

Unfortunately, women’s increased level of education has not led to a sufficient rise in women’s career advancement or employment conditions, and their skills and knowledge are underrated, despite the fact that an average of 60% of university graduates are women and, in my home country, the figure is as much as 70%.

      <p sl="en">In favour. In 2010, in the EU, employment in the service sector accounted for 69.4% of all jobs, while in industry this figure was 25.4% and in agriculture 5.2%. Most of the female workforce is employed in the service sector: 83.1% compared with 58.1% of the male workforce. Almost half of women in employment are concentrated in 10 of the 130 occupations of the International Standard Classification of Occupations: shop salespersons and demonstrators, domestic and related helpers, cleaners and launderers, personal care and related workers, other office clerks, administrative associate professionals, housekeeping and restaurant services workers, secretaries and keyboard operators, general managers, finance and sales associate professionals and nursing and midwifery associate professionals. This horizontal segregation follows certain stereotypes rooted in society, which assume that there are male and female jobs, and that the latter are associated with the work that women do in the home and are, in some way, considered as an extension of these (clothing and textiles, teaching, nursing, cleaning, etc.). It is also noted that there is a concentration of women working in the public sector, with 25% of women compared with 17% of men.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In all, 83% of the female workforce is employed in the service sector. It is therefore essential to focus once again on women’s working conditions in this sector. We can never overemphasise the importance of ensuring that women are fully integrated into the labour market, combating the discrimination they suffer. In fact, women hold most of the precarious jobs and they are under-represented in senior official and decision-making positions. The first measure has to concentrate on wages. How can we justify the fact that women today still earn 16% less than men? We must ensure that the principle of equal pay for men and women for equal work is applied urgently. This discrimination is evident everywhere, even in the political sphere. If the European Union does not give women the opportunity to make the most of their skills, it will be betraying its values and paving the way for the obscurantism that is unfortunately rife in other parts of the world. I therefore voted for this report, which calls on the European institutions and the Member States to put an end to the glass ceiling that women have to face in their careers and to adopt measures to make it easier to reconcile work and family life.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the European Parliament’s resolution on the improvement of women’s working conditions in the service sector. Currently, nine out of ten jobs created are in the service sector. Achieving a 75% employment rate among adults by 2020, which is the primary goal of the European Union, requires the entry of a significant number of women into the labour market. Currently, the employment rate for women is 62.1%, compared to 75.1% for men.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In particular, I would like to draw attention to the need to break the horizontal segregation prevalent in the labour market by means of, for example, information campaigns, training courses and vocational training programmes. In Poland, women prevail in low-paid jobs which, nevertheless, require qualifications and experience. I refer to jobs in administration, social care, education and medical care professions such as nursing and midwifery. This is mainly a result of stereotypical divisions into female and male occupations. On average, women also have to work four years longer than men to receive a promotion and, in comparison to men, their average earnings are 16.4% lower.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We require more EU projects which will help women to break stereotypes and take up education and professional career options in different sectors. I conduct training of this nature for women as part of my project Akademia Polka Potrafi (‘Polish Women Can’ Academy). These are free training sessions for women who want to be active in professional, political or social fields, or who want to start their own business. The academy teaches women how to cope with different challenges and provides information on the various types of support available. I encourage everyone to create similar schemes aimed at providing assistance to women.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for this report, which was initially proposed by my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. It highlights the extent to which women are most affected by precarity, which is a persistent feature of the labour markets in all EU Member States. In fact, almost 80% of part-time work is carried out by women; they hold the majority of fixed-term contracts; and they earn, on average, 16.4% less than their male counterparts in the same jobs, with this figure rising to 17.1% in the service sector. This report highlights the extent to which the practical inequalities between men and women persist at a high level, despite the EU’s efforts in this area. Consequently, the report calls on the Member States to improve women’s working conditions, for example, by ratifying without delay Convention No 189 of the International Labour Organisation (‘Decent work for domestic workers’) or by turning precarious work in the service sector into stable work through different measures (introduction of a special regime for the personal service sector in order to combat undeclared work, efforts by the Council to break the deadlock with regard to the amendment to the directive on pregnant workers).</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted for the improvement of women’s working conditions in the service sector through adoption of amendments to the directive on pregnant workers and acceptance of the flexible working hours proposed by Parliament. In my view, it is very important to advance the protection of rights and improve the working conditions of pregnant workers and of those who have recently given birth. The protection of motherhood and fatherhood against dismissal from employment, salary cuts during maternity leave and downgrading of job status or remuneration upon return to work are issues that need to be addressed on the basis of the highest possible standards. Article 43 highlights the situation of locums and temporary employees who will be able to assert rights to an extent that reflects their work contribution, which will ensure their equal treatment in relation to permanent workers. I agree that it is necessary to provide strengthened policies aimed at reconciling work and family life. In particular, we need to create and expand public social service facilities in order to increase care services for children and other dependants. The provision of such facilities can also significantly help to reduce poverty among women by making it possible for them to work.</p>

The situation of many women who provide domestic services and are not covered by any form of social security is also tragic. Although we do not support some of the report’s recommendations regarding deepening the services market, we think the main thrust of the report is towards increasing the rights of women working in the service sector: it calls for precarious labour relations in the service sector to be combated; it encourages the Member States to ratify International Labour Organisation Convention No 189 on domestic workers; and it stresses the need to increase and create publicly owned facilities and social services for supporting children and dependants that are free and of a high quality.

For these reasons, these issues require an adequate public funding to guarantee equal access to education without any kind of social discrimination.

This report adopted by the European Parliament demonstrates that drastic reductions in education budgets would result in short-term savings but would have much higher costs in the long term. Indeed, we could end up with a low-skilled or unskilled workforce that is ill-equipped to meet the needs of the labour market, and that would lead indirectly to a fall in Member State revenue.

I voted in favour of the report because I acknowledge the priority of education policy. I support the European harmonisation of dual vocational training systems, and I am of the opinion that practical training should be given greater priority in higher education. The report points out that students and educators in vocational education and training should be encouraged to make more efficient use of the opportunities provided by mobility.

Basically, it is important to stress that the perspective and best interest of the student takes priority when talking about education. We should also consider the issue of early years development because this stage is the foundation for subsequent education and learning. Sadly, this area is often neglected due to economic difficulties and it is therefore important to stress that it is not a luxury, which can be cut with impunity. Investment in this area may have excellent social results in future, such as lower crime rates.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for the report on Education, Training and Europe 2020. In the context of an unstable economy and the ageing of the EU population, education and training must be crucial areas of investment in order to combat unemployment and improve young people’s access to employment. The heterogeneity of the education and training systems in the Member States can be both a strength and an obstacle: it is a strength because we can draw on them and exchange expertise and good practices in order to combat early school leaving, for example, but it is also an obstacle in terms of the coordination of training and certification systems and the cross-border mobility of learners. I believe, too, that we urgently need to modernise educational and vocational guidance programmes in order to better match training to jobs in European companies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Whilst the situation in many countries of the EU relating to youth unemployment and falling education standards is indeed something that must be broached to forge an optimistic future for the next generation, I do not think it within the EU’s mandate, particularly bearing in mind the devastating impact that Brussels-borne austerity programmes have had upon growing rates of unemployment among 18-24 year olds. It is surely the focus of all national governments within the EU to target this developing scourge without feeling compelled to hand the European Commission responsibility in social policy making when the EU has such a poor track record and, in fact, has been the co-author of a great deal of recent social and economic upheaval.</p>

I agree there are still obstacles preventing the greater mobility of students in the area of education between individual states. These include insufficient knowledge of languages, insufficient advice and access to information for students and, last but not least, the mutual recognition of knowledge, qualifications and competence gained abroad. In today’s Europe, I consider it essential to encourage student mobility through various programmes, such as Erasmus, for example, and to focus on teaching foreign languages preferably as early as pre-school age. I was unable to support this report, however, since it proposes further steps leading to greater integration in the area of education and, in my view, it goes beyond the framework of the EU’s powers in this area. These are clearly defined in Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

It is necessary for people to acquire good language skills from a very early age, covering the official EU languages, as this will enable them to be more mobile and give them greater access to the labour market and far more opportunities for study, while also helping promote intercultural exchanges and greater European cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The austerity measures and resulting budget cuts that have been affecting the education and training systems throughout the EU could have negative effects in terms of the economic growth we need so badly to get us out of the current crisis. It is a priority that this growth be based on education, on knowledge and on suitable social policies. The economic costs of failing school, including dropping out, the social inequalities in the education and training system, and their impact on growth in the Member States, are significantly higher than the costs of the financial crisis. We cannot forget young people, who are being severely penalised by the effects of the crisis: they will have to play a key role in achieving the main Europe 2020 strategy targets as regards employment, research and innovation, the climate and energy, education, and combating poverty. It is essential that the Member States re-evaluate and improve their education and training policies and that they adopt specific measures for young people at risk. It is also imperative to strengthen EU-level youth policy, and it falls to the Commission to make available the necessary support – including financial support – for developing values, aptitudes and skills in the fields of education, youth and citizenship.</p>

As the rapporteur mentions, particular attention will also have to be given to the informal/non-formal vehicles that emerge inside or parallel to the formal education/training system. At times of crisis, young people – the most irreverent, creative and vulnerable to unemployment – have a major role to play in this knowledge economy, which should be stimulated and incentivised by all means necessary. The issues tackled in this report represent genuine challenges for a contemporary society increasingly committed to combating poverty, to inclusion and to social cohesion. That is why what is often called an ‘expense’ should rather be seen as a ‘smart investment’ in policies in line with the real education/training needs of society and a knowledge economy.</p>

The Member States must aim to invest at least 2% of GDP in higher education and 3% in research if they want to be able to compete with the new global economic powers.

To that end, one of the commitments is to smart growth ‘through more effective investments in education, research and innovation’. As part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the strategic framework for European cooperation on education and training has been created, known as ‘Education, Training and Europe 2020’. Mary Honeyball’s report concerns the biennial report drafted by education ministers and the Commission on progress made during the first two years of Education, Training and Europe 2020. I voted in favour because I agree with the rapporteur’s position regarding the need to increase investment in education and training, focusing on human capital and preventing early school leaving.

However, this report is contradictory. The greatest contradiction undermining it is that it advocates subordinating education and training to compliance with the Europe 2020 strategy which, as we know, seeks to establish education systems in all the Member States’ schools that serve the interests of the market, not the complete education of the individual to boost their free and full development and elevate their individual and collective conscience and their contribution to developing society as a whole.

Education policy is an exclusive responsibility of Member States, as stated in Article 165 of the Treaty, which recognises ‘the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems’. As such, I cannot support the demands of this report for European frameworks.

In spite of the fiscal consolidation process, Member States must improve access to lifelong learning for all. Investing in human capital and preventing early school leaving should not be regarded as costs but as a fundamental condition for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and should therefore be assessed purely in terms of competitiveness. Education is a basic human right that should be guaranteed to all with a special emphasis on the younger generation and members of vulnerable groups, including people who are not employed or in education or training. Investment in high-quality education and training plays a key role in overcoming the economic crisis by increasing Europe’s competitiveness, helping the workforce adapt to a changing labour market, strengthening social cohesion, and helping to ensure that people are qualified for a broader range of jobs that can give them high-quality, permanent employment.</p>

I believe that the reinforcement of the fight against early school leaving, the implementation of lifelong learning and efforts to improve transnational mobility and Europe’s skills base are all welcome steps. It is important to note, however, that in my opinion, there are areas that did not receive sufficient attention, even though their importance is undisputable. These include the issue of language learning and language skills, which are among the greatest potential barriers to finding employment anywhere within the European Union. Language skills are useful generally, but in the context of the European Union, multilingualism is a vital part of how we function. Another crucial aspect for the future of Europe is to ensure the general availability of high-quality early-childhood education, which can facilitate the achievement of two of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy at once: on the one hand, it can contribute to reducing the rate of early school leavers to under 10% and, on the other, it could help at least 20 million people to rise up from being threatened by poverty and social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Education and training are the cornerstones for achievement of the Europe 2020 goals. The existing inequalities in education and training systems need to be removed and the Member States must develop increasingly effective strategies for lifelong learning.

      <p sl="de">Education has a significant impact and affects all age groups:</p>
      <p sl="de">Language skills and multilingualism should, in particular, be promoted at an early age. They not only increase access to the labour market in the future but also increase training opportunities and contribute to cultural exchange. A comprehensive offering of languages in schools is one way to achieve this goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">Particular attention should be paid to young people, since unemployment in the EU has risen above 20% and is even 50% in some Member States. I therefore support the call to reduce the number of early school leavers, increase training opportunities and simplify integration into the world of work for young people. Access to learning must be expanded, for instance, by promoting exchange programmes between pupils, students and teachers.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the opportunity for learning later in life should also be given, for the purpose of solidarity between generations, in order to encourage lifelong learning.</p>

First of all, we need to improve skills and knowledge to limit this phenomenon. We also need to make additional efforts to inform young people about the training available to them, especially the opportunities to train abroad. That is not all, however, because we know, too, that many young people are overqualified and still struggle to find work.

      <p sl="en">As the recent report of EU education ministers and the Commission points out, more efforts are necessary for reaching the EU 2020 headline target for tackling early school leaving (ESL). The absence of early childhood education has been identified by several studies as one of the main reasons behind ESL and, despite the recommendation of the European Commission network on child care to invest at least 1% of GDP on early education, the vast majority of EU Member States still lag behind this level and the most vulnerable are most likely to be left out, or to enrol late and, even if they attend pre-school, the necessary services appropriate for their age and development are not secured. In the most disadvantaged micro-regions, there is no pre-school service available, despite the usually high number of children and the fact that early childhood development plays an essential role in developing the necessary cognitive, emotional, social and physical attributes (the absence of which increases the risk of ESL and low educational performance), or the option of redirecting disadvantaged children into special schools. Poor performing pupils are also much more likely to fall victim to high risk behaviours, such as drugs, criminality, or early parenthood.</p>

According to an OECD survey carried out in 2004, however, only five countries out of the 20 reviewed had achieved this investment level. In the context of an unstable economic climate and a period of drastic austerity measures, childhood education is easily neglected.

Professions appear and disappear from one decade to the next, and there is a steady rise in the number of people unable to continue making a living because they are not keeping pace with scientific and technological developments.

      <p sl="en">I supported this report and welcome the rapporteur’s statement that ‘There should be further research into the idea of student grants at the pre-university stage of education. For many students across Europe from poorer backgrounds, education becomes unaffordable for their family way before they get to university age. They feel pressurised by their financial situation into leaving school early and getting a job. Financial constraints make re-entering education and the secondary school level difficult as well. There have been schemes in many countries that sought to offer financial support directly to students from poorer backgrounds so that they can stay in school. It would be useful to do a study on the effectiveness of such schemes’.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the report by Ms Honeyball on education, training and Europe 2020 for a number of reasons. Not only does this report encourage programmes that will help accomplish the Europe 2020 strategy, but many of the provisions also target issues that have arisen from the current economic crisis. The focus on lifelong learning concentrates on developing a workforce that continues to accrue skills even after formal schooling has ended. The report also draws attention to the current status of youth unemployment in the EU. It is necessary to combat this growing problem by creating a more efficient school system and encouraging meaningful vocational education and training. Additionally, it is important to establish a system of early childhood education and care as this is the foundation for a student’s future success in the labour market and reduces educational costs in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on Education, Training and Europe 2020, which points out that young people are particularly affected by unemployment, with more than 20% of young Europeans out of work. Dual vocational training therefore allows a better entry into the world of work thanks to the practical dimension that it incorporates. The difficulties young graduates experience in finding work should force the Member States to analyse and evaluate the quality of their education systems so that these systems prepare students effectively for the labour market by giving them the opportunity to gain professional experience.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The fact that we regularly discuss the general state of education and training across the whole EU helps us assess the progress made towards achieving the common targets. Cooperation on education and training can certainly help fulfil the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. We must make greater efforts not only to reduce the school dropout rate, but also to increase the percentage of higher-education graduates, including by providing support to young people who come from families experiencing financial difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Early years education is, for its part, an extremely valuable factor contributing to further personal development. We cannot afford to abandon this training aspect, which has a positive long-term impact on national budgets and on public health, helping reduce anti-social behaviour later on.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The EU’s multiannual financial framework provides for the biggest percentage increase under the EU’s long-term budget for education and related sectors. Yet Member States are unfortunately making cuts to the budget of education and training due to the present economic situation. This jeopardises our goals for establishing a knowledge-based economy. Only with sufficient state funding can education and training policies ensure non-discriminatory access to education for everyone, irrespective of social or economic status, race or political affiliation. Financial austerity measures hinder the entry of socially disadvantaged students to secondary or university education. I agree that the effectiveness of schemes offering financial support to these students to allow them to continue their studies should be assessed. Unless Member States take measures in the interest of early school leavers who give up education and training, early school leaving could have dire consequences. This issue must be urgently addressed, because their lack of qualifications makes these people the least able to succeed on the labour market. The negative impact of the crisis is also noticeable in the employment rate of young people and, as a result, new graduates are often unable to find employment corresponding to their qualifications. Vocational education and training must therefore be given special priority in higher education. Better and more targeted information and career orientation is needed, in line with the demands of the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I certainly consider investment in high-quality education and training to be investment in the competitiveness of the European economy. Rapidly changing labour market conditions require a flexible workforce that will be able to adapt to an ever greater variety of jobs in order to secure high-quality and sustainable employment. Member States must also, however, seek ways to balance labour market supply and demand in the various sectors of the national economy. In this regard, I support the modernisation of training programmes in sectors that do not enjoy universal popularity among the younger generations in particular, but the demands of society require a regular supply of qualified workers. These include, for example, technical areas, the area of research and innovation, and the energy sector, which should be promoted more and made more attractive in the minds of people. In my opinion, an education and training programme should also encompass the traditional crafts that are our cultural heritage, in order to prevent their gradual disappearance and total loss.</p>

The number of early school leavers throughout the EU is certainly far too high and measures must be taken to reduce this. The report mentions the need for multilingualism, which makes it significantly easier for EU citizens to cross the borders of individual Member States to work there. I abstained from voting since no options were indicated here for how the question of education could be resolved from a financial point of view. It is true that the rapporteur pointed out problems in this regard. However, there is no discussion about their resolvability.

The report emphasises that the perspectives and interests of pupils and students should have the highest priority when it comes to the subject of education.

Only five of the 27 EU Member States have been able to implement the European Commission’s proposal on allocating 1% of their GDP to education. I therefore welcome the proposals contained in the report on increasing funding for early years education and on promoting multilingualism and lifelong learning programmes because without a responsible approach to the development of education programmes, we will be unable to achieve the ‘Europe 2014-2020’ objectives outlined.</p>

Despite the fact that the Commission proposal takes account of the above to a certain degree, its communication does not include crucial sectors, such as the demographic problem in Europe, linguistic obstacles in the EU and greater investment in lifelong learning and retraining problems, especially of the social groups with the fewest opportunities. Education and training, which are supreme social goods, should not be downgraded by the crisis; on the contrary, they should be highlighted as ways out of it.

The crisis puts the future of young people at serious risk. Youth unemployment has risen from 15.5% in 2008 to 22.5% in 2012, while the percentage of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 who are not working, studying or training has risen by two points. In 2010, 53% of the young people who had left school early were unemployed. We are asking the Member States to target a total investment of at least 2% of GDP in higher education and 3% in research. Moreover, by 2020, Europe must increase to 40% the number of young people with a university education and reduce early school leaving to below 10%.

This is a very important report which, once implemented effectively, will contribute towards increased employment, especially for women, young people and the long-term unemployed. The Member States have to invest in learning, namely in education, lifelong learning, scientific research and innovation, as well as in improved language skills. Training programmes and education profiles need to be better adjusted to the needs of the labour market. It is important to improve academic and career guidance services and encourage traineeships and apprenticeships for women. It is also important to create new opportunities for training in order to increase employment prospects in the low carbon and high-tech sectors of the economy.

      <p sl="hu">Considering that we are going through the most serious and prolonged crisis period in the history of the European Union, education and training and the prevention of early school leaving are, in the present situation, an investment that can guarantee successful crisis management. There is a great need to ensure that supply and demand on the labour market are precisely matched, so that the creation of ‘lost generations’ can be avoided. The greatest assistance in this can come from lifelong learning, because through it we can, and must, adapt to the changing opportunities on the labour market. Through a higher quality of education and training, young – and not so young – generations can improve the chances of successfully combating the crisis. Member States are facing a difficult task: it is not easy to create synergies between the supply of labour and the ability of the labour market to absorb it. Highly qualified people can find employment more easily, but we should be cautious of the risk of a ‘dumping’ of high qualifications, as society is in great need of craftsmen and skilled workers, as well as the preservation of traditional trades.</p>

In order to guarantee the investments for the future, the Socialists proposed excluding investments in education and training from the national deficit calculation of the fiscal compact. As the report points out, dropping out of school early has a higher cost than the crisis. There is thus no point in making short-term savings that would compromise future growth. For the same reasons, we encourage the Member States to devote at least 2% of their GDP to higher education in order to ensure a knowledge-based economy.

This is very important since, in many regions of the European Union, including the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship I come from, young people with the lowest qualifications are the ones who suffer the most from the effects of the crisis. It is therefore essential that these people increase their qualifications and acquire language skills, thanks to easier access to schools and traineeships. This will improve their chances of finding employment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report is contradictory and focuses on what we might call ‘education for the market’, rather than the ‘education for life’ that we advocate. Nevertheless, the text identifies a number of problems existing in the Member States, inter alia : public underfunding of higher education and research; the relationship between economic costs resulting from failing or dropping out of school and their impact on the Member States’ economic growth; the approach to lifelong learning; and the insufficient network of pre-school education. The incurable contradiction of this report concerns the subordination of education and training to compliance with the Europe 2020 strategy which, as we know, seeks to establish education systems in all the Member States’ schools that serve the interests of the market, not the all-round education of the individual to boost their creativity and elevate their individual and collective conscience.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report, since we need to encourage access to culture, not restrict it. The EU should create a clearer, simple legal framework, harmonised for audiovisual work, so as to achieve a digital single market. Currently, the various regulatory systems throughout the EU prevent creators from benefiting from a consistent and harmonised market. Moreover, providers cannot develop effective online services, which has recently prevented the public from accessing audiovisual content. Without a European cultural market, we will never achieve a genuine and unlimited pan-European culture, in which the cultural diversity of all the Member States should be accessible to all Europeans via a genuine European citizenship.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European audiovisual sector has had to cope with numerous changes in the market in recent years. The development of the Internet must be seen as an opportunity to link content to online platforms while ensuring fair remuneration for authors.

Teaching young people about new technologies, promoting new exchange and payment methods for these works, and allowing balanced negotiations between authors, producers and consumers are just some of the challenges for the future of the sector.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The report of Mr Cavada represents an important milestone in the development of the European audiovisual sector. The Internet is currently the number one information source for young people and is a new channel for people seeking information. The possibility of digital recording is an invaluable asset for culture as well. The reason I supported the report is that it offers a comprehensive description of the issues related to the legal framework of the audiovisual sector, the increasing demand for a legally available selection of works of art, the possibilities provided for their distribution by online use, and the dangers of piracy. It supports the protection of cultural diversity, which is something I myself often stress. In my opinion, one of the important points of the report is that it emphasises media literacy, as the media have great social responsibility. At the same time I support the idea that public archives should make use of the means of digitisation, thus providing the broadest possible access to these cultural treasures.</p>

I welcome the proposals to improve conditions to acquire original works online, and to develop alternative and innovative micro-payment systems, such as payment by text message. I welcome calls to permanently apply an international system for the identification and numbering of audiovisual works which would give each work a permanent unique number and would therefore facilitate the movement of works.

It is therefore essential to create a system encouraging legal content available to all in which the authors and artists involved are awarded fair and proportional remuneration, by means of individual contracts or collective work agreements. This same system should also take into account the fact that legal constraints should not be imposed on licences; should ensure the neutrality of the Internet; should adapt European law to the realities of the Internet and digital era; should guarantee legal certainty for rights owners and consumers through better coordination of legislation among Member States; should allow Internet users legal certainty when using streaming services; and integrate new technologies into national education programmes.

      <p sl="ro">Digital technology and the Internet are changing very quickly the way in which audiovisual materials are produced, sold and distributed. Consumers increasingly want to be able to view anything, anywhere, any time, using any device.

While realistically acknowledging the features, if not the limitations, of the European market, I would like to add a few comments of my own. The new challenges and opportunities available even to small businesses with room for creativity and initiative for authors and performers lead to a number of recommendations. Where possible, there should be incentives in the form of remuneration in order to encourage the development of talents and a more conducive system of taxation; administrative and bureaucratic obstacles need to be removed; audiovisual piracy must be tackled; the Internet must remain neutral; and finally, platforms must be interoperable and there should be free access to content and to the markets.</p>

While the cultural and creative sector offers enormous economic potential (around 2.5% of the EU’s GDP), the main challenges for the online distribution of audiovisual works are user accessibility and the attractiveness of legal audiovisual content. There is a high concentration of illegal content and this hinders investment in the sector. The text adopted therefore emphasises the importance of a more diverse legal supply of content and supports more flexible release windows.

Nowadays, a whole panoply of content of which the majority of people have no awareness is just a click away. The arrival of new data-transfer technologies like ADSL, fibre optic, cable Internet, etc. enables the infinite diffusion of content, specifically in the form of streaming. Online distribution of audiovisual works in the EU needs to be properly regulated, since the crisis we are experiencing requires us to seek new job opportunities that can respond to the cultural and creative industries. I voted for Jean-Marie Cavada’s report because I think that, in the digital era, with the new information technologies, the audiovisual sector could constitute a veritable jungle in which creators are exploited by unscrupulous producers and/or companies completely disrespecting the market rules.

      <p sl="pt">The circulation of works of art and artistic creations, and the diffusion of knowledge, arts and culture, in themselves, represent elements boosting human and social development. The online distribution of audiovisual works constitutes a strong expression of cultural dissemination. The circulation of artistic and cultural works clearly benefits society as a whole, and artists, authors and producers are no exception. Cultural policy should not be based on protecting property rights and creating new market segments, thereby sacrificing enjoyment, as advocated in this report; rather, it should be geared towards ever increasing mass access and cultural enjoyment, as well as the creation of culture itself, whilst safeguarding copyright. We would also draw attention to the intentional confusion between sharing – free and without commercial intentions – and piracy. This confusion has paved the way for a sort of hyper-vigilance and punishment, even when these can be shown to be harmful to the free circulation of works, entail high costs, and prove socially ineffective.</p>

This system must not be undermined because it ensures a good commercial balance between all of the partners in the sector. In the EU, the production, funding and distribution of audiovisual works are handled by a complex network of large, medium-sized and small enterprises, each of which is specialised and has its own particular characteristics.

      <p sl="pl">In an age where the Internet is the most widely used tool for both work and leisure, intellectual property rights have to keep up with consumer needs and technological developments. Improvements in the audiovisual service sector, by way of support for online services, are of enormous importance for the promotion of European civilisation as well as for linguistic and cultural diversity. European broadcasters finance over 80% of the production of original audiovisual content and also fulfil an important role in the promotion of creative industries in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is important to provide both the holders of copyright and the users of works with legal certainty as regards copyright within the European cyberspace through greater coordination in the legal provisions of individual Member States. We already have rules for the free flow of goods and services throughout the European Union but, paradoxically, these do not apply to cyberspace, which itself is rooted in freedom and the absence of barriers. This must change. The European Commission should ask Internet companies throughout Europe to make it possible to purchase digital services in a Member State other than the consumer’s country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order to provide artists with better legal protection against their works being made available online illegally, we must offer consumers a competitive alternative. At present, about 35.8% of films are downloaded illegally and up to 98.8% of data downloads using P2P networks breach copyright. Often, consumers do not have a convenient legal alternative so they use illicit practices. We must find a solution to this problem. I support and encourage the European Commission in its continuing efforts to promote and improve access to European culture online.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Creativity in the audiovisual and film industries is not just art; it is also a market sector that provides many jobs throughout the European Union. The economic contribution of culture and the arts expressed as added value is some 2.5% of GDP. To ensure continued growth in this market, we should create favourable conditions for the creation of audiovisual materials and also provide protection to the creators. However, it is easy to forget that, in the age of the Internet, distribution of and access to audiovisual materials takes place increasingly through illegal channels. Consumers using this type of channel often do not understand the meaning of intellectual property rights. In the light of the above, consumers should be given appropriate information about all the issues relating to intellectual property rights that may come up with regard to file-sharing using cloud computing services. Ease of access to audiovisual materials should, one would think, result in increased revenues for the creators and performers of these materials. However, the earnings obtained by them are often very modest. It would be worth therefore putting some effort into finding a solution that would allow authors and performers to receive appropriate remuneration.</p>

This distribution will not have any impact on authors’ rights because they are protected and recognised by the European Parliament as tools that defend creativity. Through this text, which I supported, it will be possible to publish throughout the European Union photos, films and other documents that are covered by authors’ rights, but whose holders cannot be identified.

      <p sl="ro">Given not only the specific nature of the audiovisual sector but also the fragmentation of the European online market, a uniform approach must be adopted to a number of issues at EU level. Using content online can provide a real opportunity to broadcast and distribute European works more widely, provided that the audiovisual works are supplied legally, respecting copyright. If we take a look at the European figures available, one interesting point which can be noticed is that the cultural and creative industries we are referring to contribute up to 2.5% to GDP, which is similar to the figure for the car industry. This makes it all the more necessary to organise public information campaigns about the importance of copyright, together with programmes for promoting digital and media skills for all EU citizens, including people with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am also in favour of facilitating online payment methods for audiovisual works, as well as of reviewing the costs involved, to make them affordable to the public, as a preferable option to piracy. I also stress how important it is to adapt European legislation to the reality of the Internet and the digital era, with one of the biggest challenges still being how to prevent access to platforms offering illegal content.</p>

      <p sl="de">European cinema is an economic factor which should not be underestimated. European productions bring in money for the Member States while they are being shown and also serve to make viewers aware of a wide range of different regions. In 2010, 1 203 films were produced in Europe. In the US, there were ‘only’ 754. Numerous SMEs profit due to European internal market film productions. However, it is becoming more and more difficult to monitor the legal distribution of audiovisual content in the Internet era. This results in the unequal treatment of online and offline services. Many audiovisual services use the Internet for distribution and marketing of their content and services. I abstained from voting since I believe that a number of approaches are required to regulate the audiovisual market on the Internet. On the one hand, care has to be taken to ensure that no copyright infringements result and, on the other hand, Internet neutrality and unregulated access must remain guaranteed for users.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The distribution of artistic works in the film and audiovisual sector is not a simple matter. In this sector, art meets industry. Since the European Union has to be focused primarily on culture and education, it is essential to secure proper resources and opportunities for the dissemination of European films. Similarly, it is necessary to ensure the effective preservation of these works, primarily through digitisation. The cultural industry is not only an opportunity for artists: it also represents a significant number of jobs, and its economic contribution amounts to 2.5% of GDP, which is the same figure as for the car industry. Unfortunately, audiovisual production in the EU and its distribution involve a complex network of large, medium-sized and small enterprises, each of which is specialised and unique in its own way. It is essential that the EU has a clear, transparent, straightforward and, in particular, coherent legal framework for audiovisual works, because only in this way will it be possible to achieve a single digital market. Such integration will help create the new business models and distribution channels needed to improve and simplify access for consumers across the EU.</p>

It is becoming increasingly more problematic to monitor the legal distribution of audiovisual content. In the case of the current plethora of content on the Internet, the concern is that AdWords reference services, which, for instance, are operated by large American providers, will also mainly refer to links which will direct consumers to non-domestic or non-European sites or services. I abstained from voting because many steps are still required in order to regulate the controlled and legal distribution of content and services on the Internet.</p>

      <p sl="en">The audiovisual and cinema sectors are vital components of the EU’s cultural and creative industries, which collectively contribute added value to the economy to the tune of 2.5% of total GDP – as much as the automotive industry. I supported this report because it calls for a public environment that fosters the creation and accessibility of legal audiovisual content. Legal certainty and regulation of authors’ rights and copyright laws must exist in the European online environment in order to establish such beneficial conditions. The distribution and promotion of original European audiovisual content is vital to the development of European education and culture in today’s digital age.</p>

      <p sl="el">The audiovisual sector combines intellectual creation, culture and art with industry. The coexistence of these two different elements requires tools to encourage the artistic expression of creators, especially young creators, while at the same time finding ways of enabling it to create jobs and thus make a contribution to the economy. Certainly, any policy in this sector cannot ignore new technologies and the dynamism which they impart to the audiovisual sector. One of the facts highlighted by this report, which I supported, is that Union policy must aim to create an environment conducive to universally accessible legal content. This is in keeping with Europe’s moral obligation to protect holders of intellectual property rights, without depriving citizens of knowledge and education.</p>

Furthermore, taking into account the fact that the cultural and creative industries provide a significant number of jobs in the Union and their economic contribution in terms of added value amounts to 2.5% of GDP, equal to that of the automotive sector, and that a very strong case may be made for the introduction of an international system for identifying cinematographic, audiovisual and multimedia works, and underlining the need to adapt European law to the realities of the Internet and the digital age, I voted in favour of the proposal.</p>

I believe that we have to act at European level to combat the fragmentation of this sector and move towards a single digital market. The development of this digital market faces a number of substantial challenges that we must overcome together. I am therefore pleased that this resolution takes into account the need for a competitive audiovisual sector that creates jobs and protects the interests of consumers and rights holders. With that in mind, I supported the invitation to the Member States to ban buyout contracts for the online distribution of audiovisual works. I believe that authors and performers should receive adequate and fair remuneration in proportion to the online exploitation of their works. In the same vein, I voted in favour of the principle of chronology, which allows audiovisual works to benefit from an efficient pre-financing system.</p>

Following my report on ‘unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries’, adopted last year, Parliament adopted today a resolution on the online distribution of audiovisual works in the European Union. I supported this report, which seeks, in particular, to provide better access to audiovisual works available online – films, music and rebroadcasts (streaming) – particularly beyond national territories and linguistic limitations. Counterfeiting and piracy discourage investment in this sector. The report therefore emphasises the importance of developing a more diverse legal supply of content and more flexible release windows. Finally, legal certainty with regard to authors’ rights and better collection of those rights must be guaranteed at all stages of the creation and distribution process.</p>

I should stress that the digital divide between Member States or regions of the EU poses a serious barrier to the development of the digital single market. I recommend expanding broadband Internet access throughout the EU with a view to encouraging access to online services and new technologies.</p>

It also rejects the principle of pan-European licences, which would have paved the way for the monopolisation of the audiovisual market by a number of big players to the detriment of many SMEs, which form the real backbone of the audiovisual and cinematographic industry today.

      <p sl="pt">The circulation of works and creations, and the diffusion of knowledge, arts and culture, in themselves represent an element boosting creativity, and elevating human, individual and collective consciousness. The online distribution of audiovisual works constitutes a strong expression of cultural dissemination. The circulation of artistic and cultural works clearly benefits society and the economy as a whole, and artists, authors and producers are no exception. Cultural policy should not be based on protecting property rights and creating new market segments, thereby sacrificing enjoyment, as advocated in this report; rather, it should be geared towards ever increasing mass access and cultural enjoyment, whilst safeguarding intellectual property rights. We also need to draw attention to the confusion between sharing – free and without commercial intentions – and piracy, which they have been exploiting for the purposes of censorship, hyper-vigilance and punishment, even when these can be shown to be harmful to the free circulation of works, entail high costs and prove socially ineffective.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am really honoured to present to you today the Council’s position on the draft budget of the European Union for the financial year 2013, which was adopted by the Council on 24 July 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council is, of course, ready to work with both Parliament and the Commission during the next few weeks and months in order to secure agreement on a realistic and balanced budget for 2013. I am confident that we can achieve this if we cooperate closely. The Council is, for its part, ready to work constructively and in a spirit of compromise. The first budgetary trialogue, which took place on 9 July, was positive and encouraging.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following discussions on the draft budget proposed by the Commission, the Council’s position on the draft budget for 2013 foresees an increase of 1.27% in commitment appropriations and 2.79% in payment appropriations as compared with the 2012 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to draw your attention to the three important points which underpin the Council’s position. Firstly, the Council decided to give priority to the programmes and actions of the EU budget which will help resolve the current economic crisis, support competitiveness and convergence, create employment opportunities and boost economic growth. Secondly, since 2013 is the last year of the current multiannual financial framework, the Council proposed an increase in the level of payment appropriations significantly above inflation. Thirdly, the Council took into account the measures taken by Member States to consolidate their national budgets and, in the current economic context, particular emphasis was placed on keeping administrative expenditure under control in line with Member States’ domestic policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will briefly set out the main elements of the Council’s position on each of the headings and subheadings of the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">Starting with heading 1 (Sustainable growth), the Council considers that this heading should be one of the top priorities in the 2013 budget. It has therefore proposed a substantial increase in both commitment appropriations (+2.79%) and payment appropriations (+6.71%). This increase will ensure that adequate financial resources are available to implement the Compact for Growth and Jobs agreed at the June European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council attaches particular importance to the implementation of the various programmes and actions under this heading which play a key role in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy and will help deliver sustainable economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council has also sought to secure an adequate level of payment appropriations for structural actions. It therefore agreed that under subheading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment), payment appropriations should grow by more than 8% compared to 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to heading 2 (Preservation and management of natural resources), the Council proposes to stabilise the level of commitment appropriations compared to 2012. Nevertheless, because of accelerated implementation in the final year of the current multiannual financial framework, it supports an increase of more than EUR 440 million in payment appropriations compared to 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The cuts applied to this heading are the result of an analysis of past budget implementation and of expected absorption capacities. They are based on the latest information available and are subject to revision following the presentation by the Commission of its traditional letter of amendment in the autumn at the end of the 2012 agricultural year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding heading 3 (Citizenship, freedom, security and justice), the Council supports modest reductions to both commitment and payment appropriations since it considers that the increases proposed by the Commission would exceed realistic absorption capacities. Nevertheless the Council has proposed a substantial increase (+5% in payment appropriations) under subheading 3a (Freedom, security and justice) in order to strengthen several budget lines, especially the one related to the External Borders Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to Heading 4 (The EU as a global player), the Council set commitment and payment appropriations at a lower level than that proposed by the Commission, taking into account past and current budget implementation and realistic absorption capacities, as well as the varying requirements of the different budgetary years.</p>
      <p sl="en">This heading, together with subheading 1a and 1b and heading 2, is covered by a statement on payment appropriations in which the Council invites the Commission to submit a draft amending budget if payment requirements in 2013 exceed expected needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to heading 5 (Administration), the Council, as usual, did not modify the European Parliament’s section of the budget. With regard to the other sections, whilst the Council acknowledges the efforts made by the Commission and other institutions to limit the increase in their respective budget estimates, it identified further potentials for savings. As a result, it set the administrative appropriations for the Commission and the other institutions at close to their 2012 levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council also rejected the creation of new posts in the establishment plans of the institutions, with the exception of posts related to the accession of Croatia. Furthermore, in the light of the Commission’s proposal to reduce by 5% the number of posts during the period 2013-2017, the Council has applied a 1% reduction of staff in the establishment plans of the institutions, apart from the European External Action Service, due to its recent creation, and the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Ombudsman, due to their small size.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, with regard to the decentralised agencies, the Council decided to maintain the level of appropriations for operational activities as proposed by the Commission, resulting in an increase of appropriations of +1.98% on average, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the nominal freeze applied to most of the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same 1% reduction of staff was applied to those well-established decentralised agencies. New posts were only accepted for agencies in the start-up phase or for those which have been given new tasks. Overall, the Council has agreed to the creation of 185 new posts in decentralised agencies. More than one third of these will be for the three financial supervisory authorities (the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Market Authority).</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am convinced that the Council’s position on the 2013 draft budget strikes the right balance between recognising the difficult economic situation in Member States and providing sufficient appropriations in the EU budget to support programmes and actions with which we are aiming to address the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Compact for Growth and Jobs agreed at the European Council in June, Heads of State or Government stated that ‘the European Union budget must be a catalyst for growth and jobs across Europe’. I very much hope that this will guide all of us in our discussions together over the next few weeks and months as we seek agreement on the 2013 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission has already, on several occasions, clearly expressed its concerns concerning the reading in the Council of the budget proposed for 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was on the occasion of the trialogue on 9 July and in President Barroso’s letter to the Heads of State, as the Council’s reading does not comply with, or even contradicts, the conclusions of the summit of European leaders on the so-called Compact for Growth and Jobs. I can quote from the conclusions at the end of June where the leaders of the 27 States agreed that the European Union’s budget must be a catalyst for growth and jobs across Europe. I think that what the Commission proposed for the last year of the present financial perspective, namely 2013, complied with the logic of this decision by the Heads of State. We were pushing down commitments but in such a way that, through savings in many areas, we are able to increase headings for growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the main battle, as usual, is about payments. It will come as no surprise to learn that we have not much choice left at the end of the financial perspective. The programmes are gaining maturity and there are growing needs and concerns as to investment capacity in many Member States of the European Union. The budget for 2011 was already too low – by EUR 5 billion at least – which did not allow us to reimburse the Ministers of 27 States. This does not help fiscal consolidation in the Member States and increases the so-called outstanding commitments or RALs.</p>
      <p sl="en">We were proposing an increase of 6.8% but this was in the areas of growth, competitiveness and jobs. I think that the measure of whether we are right or not is the development this year. I can inform you that, at this moment in time, our implementation is EUR 9 billion higher than last year and last year there was already a shortage of money for reimbursements.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have now completely exhausted the Social Fund and the Fund for Competitiveness and Employment, which is mainly for more developed regions of Europe. That indicates that we were right to increase our requests for payments for the last year of the financial perspective, especially in the areas that are really contributing to competitiveness, growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I have to say once more that I am disappointed with the Council’s reading, which cuts both commitments and payments, the latter by EUR 5 billion. Where are the most severe cuts? The biggest cuts are in Heading 1a. What is the name of this heading? Heading 1a is Competitiveness for Growth and Employment, but this also covers cohesion. As regards cohesion, there is an assumption in the Council’s reading about debt commitments and reimbursements – made too late – to the Member States. This is also about our solidarity vis-à-vis our partners worldwide. There is also the question of administrative restraint. This should go as far as possible but cannot be detrimental to the efficiency of the administration which is entrusted with much bigger tasks now than previously.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we should rather concentrate on how to realistically establish the required level of payments for the last year of the present financial perspective. I am really grateful to the Members of Parliament, including Alain Lamassoure, for the initiative to discuss the criteria and the points of reference in order to have a decent level of payments, not one that is exaggerated, but one which allows reimbursement of the money that is really needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need goodwill in these final weeks before the conciliation. We need to understand what the financial perspective is about. We should be serious about the growth and jobs compact decided on by the Member States. Therefore, I still trust that we can manage this.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Council for attending in order to explain its draft budget. This would seem quite basic, but on many occasions in the past, we have not seen the Council. I would also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for coming to explain his position, however incomprehensible that position might seem to Parliament on many occasions, despite the fact that, nevertheless, in many cases and on many points, it is not so far from our way of thinking and from our aims, which are to combat the crisis and to promote growth and employment in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission has done its job well and has done so consistently and congruently. There is little sense in increasing commitment appropriations when there are not sufficient payment appropriations to meet them. The Commission is essentially intending to eliminate an RAL (outstanding commitments) already amounting to more than the entire Union budget for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="es">Is the President-in-Office of the Council aware of the problem represented by an RAL of this size? This RAL represents, above all, a lack of credibility for the whole European Union in terms of being able to fund the projects to which it has committed, which is exactly the opposite of what the European public are asking for. They want a more effective and, above all, more credible European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Then there is the traditional attitude of the Council of applying linear cuts in order to bring budgetary provisions into line with the pressure from certain Member States. Mr President, this attitude must become history. It does not work, most of all because it distorts the correct application of the budgetary resources available. Removing EUR 5 billion from the Commission’s accounts, which are drawn up based precisely on the forecasts sent by Member States regarding the execution of the Union budget, will have side effects that we believe will be negative.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, we need to combine austerity with realism. The political groups in this House will, as ever, read this in a positive way, seeking to combine European interests with the need to balance national accounts, which have been harshly affected by the economic and financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">We expect flexibility and a pro-European attitude from you. We expect this from everyone. Let us not forget that, although they are for different financial years, the budget for 2013 and the next multiannual financial framework are going to be very much linked, both due to the proximity of their negotiations and due to the main problem: that we do not need new commitments as much as we need money to pay for the existing ones.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation of the Council’s position on the 2013 budget highlights a major contradiction between the statements by the Heads of State or Government on 28 and 29 June and the decisions made by the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) and the General Affairs Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the one hand, there has been talk about investing in growth, development and employment while, at the same time, the biggest and most substantial cuts have been made precisely to those budget lines that fund the projects and policies capable of generating growth and creating jobs, especially for young Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I have said on other occasions, I am aware of the financial difficulties that the Member States are all facing internally, but the response to the crisis needs to be ‘more Europe’ and not ‘less Europe’, as the Council has said in its public statements and hence, at the highest political level.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, we cannot peg the level of payments at a far lower level a priori , as the Council has done. As those who have spoken before me have pointed out, this is a cut of more than EUR 5 billion to the figure the Commission felt it was important to indicate in its draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to remind Mr Mavroyiannis that the Commission bases this sum on estimates from the Member States, which are then revised downwards by the Commission, so the amount indicated in the draft budget as payment appropriations – that 6.8% increase compared with the 2012 budget – is not an arbitrary figure, but a realistic indication of the necessary resources calculated by the Commission on the basis of the information provided by Member States in order to honour all the commitments made from 2007 to date.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, at the end of the financial programming, we cannot risk halting certain important research programmes because we do not have the funds to pay the invoices, as was the case in spring.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Barroso himself felt the need to write to the Heads of State or Government expressing his concern for the across-the-board cuts made by the Council at its reading.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not think I am exaggerating in saying that Europe’s credibility and reliability are at stake, and this is why Parliament will be closely monitoring the payment situation for 2012, with the aid of the Commission, which has the latest figures. I therefore hope that the interinstitutional meeting scheduled for 26 September will be a useful exercise for defining actual needs and avoiding what unfortunately happened during the previous budget procedure.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our idea, in order to try and meet citizens’ actual needs, is to propose a responsible reading able to guarantee that the European budget has the necessary resources for investment in growth and development.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the rapporteur I will concentrate on Parliament’s budget and the budget of other sections. In Parliament, we have taken into account the letter sent by Commissioner Lewandowski earlier this year asking institutions to keep their administrative budget increase to 1.9%. Earlier this year, this Parliament agreed a 1.9% rise for 2013, excluding the extra costs of Croatia, and in doing that, we froze all the allowances of Members again and we decided to cut our travel budget by 5%. We also put in place a number of other measures to make some savings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier in the year, when we discussed our estimates report, we made it clear that we would expect to find more savings in the autumn, the ultimate aim being a 1.9% increase for Parliament’s budget, including the costs of Croatia. I am delighted to say that most of the other groups and most of the other shadows have agreed with this line and I thank them for their cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, in order to achieve that figure of 1.9% including Croatia, we need to find another EUR 9 million worth of savings in Parliament’s budget and we are now looking at the possibilities for doing that. But when we do that, we will take into account that although we need to make savings, and it is important that we make those savings, we also need to make those savings without damaging the effectiveness of this Parliament and the effectiveness of Members of this Parliament. That will be our aim.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wanted to say a few words on the budget of other sections. I am pleased to say that most other institutions are also looking to come in with an increase of 1.9% including Croatia and the 1.7% salary increase which is proposed. There are a few institutions which will have problems, particularly the Court of Justice, which is seeing its workload increase by about 10% year on year. The European External Action Service is also making a case for an increase larger than 1.9% because they say they are a new institution and they have new responsibilities, particularly in the area of security.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think that rather than have a blanket freeze, as the Council is suggesting, we should look at each institution individually and see what their needs are before deciding what their increase should be and I would urge the Council to do that as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, overall, this Parliament and most of the institutions will come in at around the 1.9% figure suggested by the Commission and I think that that is good news and I think that it does show that institutions in Europe recognise the economic and financial circumstances we all face and that we are being responsible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome, of course, the remarks made by Salvador Garriga and the attitudes expressed by both rapporteurs, Mr La Via and Mr Vaughan. This is a good starting point for determining the appropriate level of financing for Europe for 2013, and it is in line with the decision of the Heads of State asking for investment in growth, competitiveness and jobs. I believe that the Council – under the leadership of Andreas Mavroyiannis – is also ready to enter the dialogue for a timely agreement. By timely agreement, I mean a timely prospect for investment for 2013.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I would also like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo, Mr La Via and Mr Vaughan for their very constructive remarks and, of course, I would like to thank my friend, Commissioner Lewandowski, for his comments – even though, on this one, we are not exactly on the same wavelength, but that is normal – so I thank you all for this very fruitful exchange of views.</p>
      <p sl="en">It shows that our presentation of the Council’s position on the draft budget for 2013 has allowed all of us to better understand the respective positions and our mutual consensus. This is the first precondition to be met on our way to reaching an agreement on the 2013 budget in the coming months, which has to be within the deadlines that are set for us by the Treaty. I think that this time around, it is of paramount importance, given the circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s discussion was a very good starting point on our way forward. This year’s budgetary procedure is taking place under extremely difficult circumstances, so we need to all work together in a constructive manner in order to succeed. We need, of course, a realistic and balanced budget for 2013. The Cyprus Presidency of the Council, and myself in particular – because Mr Lewandowski referred to me – are just humble servants on this issue, but we will do our best to get a very positive result.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, I take good note of the persisting divergence between the Commission and the Council, on the one hand, and between the positions of the Council and those of Parliament, on the other. We fully respect all of those positions. As Mr Lewandowski said, we intend to meet Parliament and the Commission on 26 September 2012 in order to discuss the level of payments for the current year.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Mr La Via’s comments, I think that you know that in the Council and the European Council – and I say this very candidly from my experience having had bilateral contact with all Member States in July – everybody, all 27 Member States, agrees on the need for the budget to be at the service of growth and jobs. Everybody agrees that we need to have quality of spending and better spending. Although it might sound ironic, those who are talking about better spending are also those who are asking for cuts, so we need to be aware that the interpretation is not exactly the same for everybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the contradiction in the European Council’s position for the combat for growth and jobs, we can assure you also that the Council in its position has left unchanged the total amount that was announced as being available from the 2013 budget – the EUR 55 billion out of the total of EUR 120 billion. This amount is there to be used accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to add that, in its traditional role as an honest broker, we rely on the Commission’s support in this during the entire budgetary procedure. As has been the case in previous years, I count sincerely on Commissioner Lewandowski to help us find a proper way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank you very much for your attention and wish you every success in your examination of the Council’s position in the coming weeks. I am looking forward to our negotiations in October and November.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The position of the Council on the 2013 budget represents something of a step in the right direction, as it assumes an increase in payments and commitments compared to 2012. Nonetheless, it includes EUR 5 billion less in payments, and EUR 1 billion less in commitments than the Commission proposal. With regard to the current economic situation in the EU, the European Parliament holds the long-term view across the political spectrum that cost-cutting measures are necessary but not decisive. In accordance with the Commission proposal, however, the European Parliament is prioritising effective management over short-sighted budgetary cuts. We must approach the setting of the budget in a responsible way, and especially take into account the real needs for fulfilling the EU’s long-term aims and commitments. This applies particularly to key investments aimed at securing the EU’s future economic growth. At the same time, all of the consequences of any cuts in the draft budget need to be considered carefully. Last but not least, it is absolutely essential to ensure that the savings do not have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the European Parliament’s work in any way. I am ready to support a budget based on an approach derived from these three working priorities and complying with the adopted social model.</p>

      <p sl="de">I have a couple of fundamental points to make concerning the budget debate: Firstly, the ‘top down’ approach must be maintained at any rate. This means that the available level of funding is determined first. Only after this will a decision be made about which expenditures will be made and where, not the other way around! The bottom up approach promoted by net receivers is exactly the wrong signal during a time of debt crisis. The EU must not spend more than the net contributors are able and willing to pay. Secondly, a central EU tax is not a solution and fiscal sovereignty must remain with the Member States. Thirdly, I see sufficient potential for savings: in administrative costs for institutions, by establishing a single seat for Parliament for instance. It is also unacceptable for the EEAS (European External Action Service) to equip itself with a number of highly remunerated management positions without providing justification for these unreasonable staff costs. Now, an increase of 9.2% is budgeted for these positions as well! Resources for decentralised agencies are also to be increased by 3.2%. Fourthly, in terms of expenditures, resources for meaningful institutions such as FRONTEX must be increased.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Certain Member States are going off the rails. Some countries know how to make themselves heard, unlike the French Government. Under the pretext of saving money, they have decided to make drastic cuts to the European Union’s budget for 2013. Of course, the crisis means that we have to think differently. Saving does not necessarily mean mortgaging our future. Cutting 15% from the research and innovation budget for 2013 and a quarter of the budget for SME development is absurd. In June, the Council wanted a pact for smart, sustainable growth, based on investment that created jobs. It all starts today. Technological innovation generates a very high added value and hundreds of thousands of highly skilled jobs. Our SMEs are the very basis of the real economy; not the basis of obscure markets, but the market that matters every day. The 2013 budget is no trivial matter. It will set the tone for the next decade, the framework of which we are currently outlining. If we are not ambitious, how do you expect our economic players to be ambitious? We need to stick to our goals and stop these endless discussions. Courageous and concrete proposals: that is what our fellow citizens want to see. Parliament, I hope, will not give in.</p>

      <p sl="el">Yet again this year, the Council has resorted to its favourite tactic of across-the-board cuts to all budget headings, without basing its decision on a detailed and thorough analysis. Although it is widely accepted and proven that cohesion policy is the main and most appropriate investment instrument for taking the EU into growth and creating jobs, the Council’s cuts focus on the objective of regional competitiveness and employment, on the objective of territorial cooperation and on the cohesion fund. It should be noted that these cuts are completely out of kilter with the conclusions of the June summit. As far as payments under this heading are concerned, the draft budget qualifies as an absolute minimum and is based on the assumption that all payments required from the previous year will be covered in 2012. However, with the Council cuts, the risk of this payment shortfall spilling over into 2013, as happened between 2011 and 2012, is more than visible. Any such development could jeopardise the proper implementation of these programmes in the final year of the current multiannual financial framework. We should therefore oppose the Council cuts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to present to you today, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the annual report on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). I am also pleased to be able to report that over the last two days, we have come to an agreement with the national parliaments to establish a standing conference involving the European Parliament and the national parliaments under conditions that bode well for the future. During this conference, I had the impression that all the national parliaments in the European Union are interested in the success of the foreign and security policy and that the cooperation and the focus on the democratic legitimation of this policy will be worthwhile.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am glad that we can do this at a time when we are seeing the first successes since the European External Action Service (EEAS) was set up. This has been a difficult process and is definitely not yet at an end. However, the first stabilising elements are emerging and it became clear during the course of the conference with the EU’s ambassadors from all over the world last week that a team is gradually developing.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need a coherent foreign and security policy which puts the emphasis on setting clear priorities and using resources appropriately. Coherence, efficiency and legitimation are important factors. We hope that, because of the opportunities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon and the fact that one person and one service have been given all the responsibility, it will be possible to achieve further synergies which will lead to a uniform foreign policy strategy for the European Union. I believe that there is still potential for improvement at the top, including the leadership at a European level. The principle of unanimity generally still applies and, as a result of the quality of the leadership, this will bring the national states closer to a one-voice policy. I believe that this is important.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are critical of some areas, but we have praise for others. I must say, Baroness Ashton, that we took a positive view of your approach to Iran’s nuclear programme and of your policy in Syria and the Middle East, where US foreign policy has largely failed in recent months. However, we are still focusing to a certain extent on synergies and a coherent overall policy. We believe that there are gaps and we hope that the situation will continue to develop in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">The national parliaments can play an important role, not only in terms of democratic legitimation, but also by cooperating, for example, with the parliaments of the Arab Spring as part of the neighbourhood policy. They can also make a contribution to ensuring that the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy leads to more democracy and the rule of law. This could also give us the power to achieve greater legitimation and credibility, so that we can play a more important foreign policy role. These are important tasks that we need to work on.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must look after the interests of our citizens. We must ensure that human rights are part of this coherent policy and that we achieve a sensible balance between national interests and human rights in the context of neighbourhood policy, trade policy and other areas. I hope that the appointment of a new Special Representative for human rights will play an important role in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must also be aware that, alongside the need for greater military cooperation, which will help to achieve synergies in these areas, our security policy and foreign policy influence should increasingly be guided by economic policy. Wars are often won nowadays not using tanks, but using financial markets. For this reason, we must also understand that the strength of the European Union is largely dependent on whether it can resolve its internal economic, monetary and fiscal crisis. The fact that other parts of the world are using this instrument to acquire power in the field of foreign policy is an important indication that we as Europeans and as citizens of our Member States have only one chance if this is to lead to a common foreign and security policy, together with a joint economic and monetary policy. This is the only opportunity for the Member States to ensure that they have a future in the world by means of sharing and pooling.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly thanking the Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the rapporteur, Elmar Brok, for his impressive and comprehensive report. It is a really important contribution with a great number of good suggestions that we can certainly use as we build the foundations of the common foreign and security policy and as we build the foundations of the new service.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have always believed that this Parliament – and Members of this Parliament – have a critical role in ensuring that we have an effective and democratic EU foreign, security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also believe – and have always believed – that, in this increasingly challenging economic environment, it makes even more sense for Member States to work together. That holds true for large Member States as well as small ones. When you look at the important issues that we face – let me take just two or three: Iran and its nuclear programme, the Middle East peace process and the crisis in Syria – we are stronger and more effective when we work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are seeking to build the best possible service that will meet the needs of Europe and the needs of Europe’s citizens. We are attracting some of the best talent from Member States and, at the same time, we have harnessed the tremendous depth of knowledge and expertise that staff from the institutions bring. I pay tribute to all of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The External Action Service (EEAS) is fast becoming a centre of excellence and a source of ideas, policy and analysis, and our network of delegations across the world is the greatest asset we have. I have been able to open new delegations in Libya and South Sudan and an office in Burma/Myanmar, an office that I would like to upgrade. We need to develop this network. We are, for example, massively under-represented in the Gulf states.</p>
      <p sl="en">What makes us different from Member States is that we work in a different way. In fact, I would argue that we work in a way that is unique to the European Union. When you look at all the crises that we face, when you look at all the situations in which we are operating, they are multi-faceted, complex and particular. In none of them is there a simple one-size-fits-all solution – political, military or economic.</p>
      <p sl="en">The great strength of the European Union, working with Member States and with our international partners, is the range of diplomatic tools at our disposal. By mobilising them all in an appropriate way, we can be more effective in preventing crisis and conflict and swifter in helping to resolve them.</p>
      <p sl="en">To develop that comprehensive approach, we need three things. We need to clearly define our strategy, bearing in mind our own interests; we have to have effective coordination of what we do; and we need swift delivery by the European Union, its Member States and the network that we have overseas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me consider two brief examples. As Honourable Members know, in August I went to Mogadishu and was also in Mombasa and Nairobi. You know very well the challenges of the region. I am very pleased that we have the new President elected in circumstances of calm. Our team in Mogadishu, our Special Representative, were there throughout the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just before this debate, I spoke to the former President, Sheikh Sharif, and to the new President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, to congratulate them on the outcome and to tell them that we would remain with them. They asked me to tell you that they are very grateful for the 22 years that we have worked to try to support the people of Somalia and that they look to us to stay with them.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we talk to the politicians in Mogadishu and in the region, we talk about a range of different activities in which we are involved: tackling piracy; enabling the World Food Programme to safely deliver its aid; bringing peace and stability to the region; supporting democracy and human rights; helping trade to flourish; building infrastructure; helping to fight terrorism and engaging in support for the peace processes and mediation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of the work of Operation Atalanta, supported at this point by 11 Member States working together, with ships, planes, helicopters and logistical support at headquarters, working and linking with other countries operating in the region, successful piracy attacks have dropped from 65 in 2010 to just five so far this year. Those who are involved in Atalanta – and I visited the French flagship Lafayette while I was there – are the first to say that they can tackle the symptoms of the problem at sea but we have to find ways to tackle the issues on the land.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have two other missions operating: the training of soldiers to help support the security situation around Mogadishu and beyond – I met the Amazon force commander who talked about the needs he has as he tries to drive forward and bring peace and security – and the operation that will help with maritime security, helping other countries to keep their shoreline and the seas free from piracy, especially important to countries like Kenya who have seen piracy now turn into kidnapping people from the shore.</p>
      <p sl="en">I went to this mission with both admirals and the colonel in charge of those missions, but I also went with those involved in development and in the humanitarian exercise to work in a coherent and comprehensive way. When I met with the politicians, who were just about to start the elections for their new government, we talked about the range of different ways in which we are involved and the fundamental needs of development.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the AMISOM forces move forward, they need help to dig wells and to provide for the people in communities who have suffered 20 years of war. They need help in supporting the move away from crisis, for peace building and mediation. I recall the very brave woman in charge of the electoral commission who talked about the need to help them build peace and to build that coordination, to engage the women of Somalia in doing that, building a government.</p>
      <p sl="en">I raised the European Union flag. It flies in Mogadishu above a very basic place that we have there – no more than a tin roof and tin walls, and yet it provides meeting rooms and beds and places for our delegation to be able to be active every day. This is one example, and it is an important symbol of that comprehensive approach that we work together right across the Commission services – right through to the provision of our military knowledge and expertise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another example is through the task forces that we have built in supporting countries going through transition. As Mr Brok has said, the economic challenges are great and, for those countries facing transition, they are immense. We are helping to support the political process where people are allowed the democracy they yearned for and that they sought and we need to link that with the capacity to help support them economically with the jobs of the future and the security for their families that will make the difference.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the task forces, we have brought together people who represent a range of support. Members of this Parliament came with us and have engaged with these new parliamentarians. These are people who, even a few weeks before the elections, were registering their political parties for the first time, people who have never worked out how you build a coalition or indeed how you build a political party that has roots that go deep, and people who need to understand the institutional side of democracy and to work, not just for one election but for all the elections to come. I pay tribute to all the Members of this Parliament who have engaged with people across the world in doing that.</p>
      <p sl="en">By bringing together, on the one hand, the resources from the Commission that can support long-term development, the instruments for stability, all of these assets that we have, and, on the other hand, those of our partners – the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Africa Bank, the World Bank, all of the institutions who are able to put grants and loans at the disposal of those who need to build sometimes the most basic of infrastructure – and by coordination through our special representatives, our delegation and our services on the ground, we are able to translate that into a day when people come together and have business leaders from across the European Union willing to commit, to engage and invest in those countries. It means we translate and leverage the resources that we have, translate the several hundred million euro we have available into billions of euro – for Jordan EUR 3 billion and for Tunisia EUR 4 billion – over the three years and make a significant difference to the lives of people.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think in taking that approach, it is where, as I have said, we offer something unique. It translates into how we support those countries that are trying to deal with real challenges at the present time of transition, not just in our southern neighbourhood, but also the challenges that exist to our east.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, we have been working closely in the Western Balkans, in Bosnia, to try to build this comprehensive approach on the ground. We are working with many countries who are engaged in Bosnia and Herzegovina and with all the leaders who need to try to push forward the government.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I recently met the leadership in Serbia and Kosovo, Prime Minister Thaci, President Nikolić and Prime Minister Dačić, I said that I would engage myself in driving forward this dialogue. However, they need to commit to really wanting to find ways through that will help to support the people whose lives are made difficult every day by the ongoing tensions and challenges of that area. I will meet with them again in New York to try to push forward on that subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">Supporting the process of change also in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and other countries in the Middle East and North Africa requires our continued support and our continued willingness to address the different challenges. On Thursday, President Morsi will arrive in Brussels for his first visit. The new President of Egypt was invited by me when I went to see him in July. He will meet with me and the Presidents to discuss the developments in his country and his role and work in the wider region. We will prepare for him the same kind of injection of economic and political support for the future but we do not just wait for those moments.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Egypt, in July, we provided two million rural Egyptian women with identity cards because without an identity card, you cannot get health care or open a bank account and you are not recognised as an individual. For those women, something that is very simple and very straightforward was beyond their capacity to be able to do. We have to be in action all the time and to be in support of the people of the country – and, I would argue, in the countries in transition, to be especially aware of the role of women.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will talk more about Syria later but I, of course, remain appalled by the violence and human rights violations which have occurred there. When I spoke with Mr Brahimi, the new representative, I offered him the full support of the European Union, including from the delegation we still have on the ground. In my discussions with countries immediately affected surrounding Syria, we have also offered them additional support. You will have seen an additional EUR 50 million being given this weekend.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also remain committed on the Middle East peace process. The goal is a just and lasting two-state solution. We need to make sure that we continue to move forward and recognise the additional challenges that are faced at the moment by Prime Minister Fayed and the Palestinian Authority in financial terms. I spoke with him yesterday and we will work together, along with the AHLC and the Norwegian Foreign Minister, to secure additional support in New York to try to make sure that the work that has been done, and which is well recognised by Israel as well as by the World Bank and countries of the region and beyond, is not allowed to fail.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we also need to understand the needs of Israel – its deep concern for its security and its worries at the present time. So we have to continue to try and find a way through that will bring security for both, but, in my view, it is increasingly urgent.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also mention, in the spirit of that region, the work that we do on Iran. I am very grateful for what Mr Brok said about my role as leader of the negotiations. I have spent 48 hours in direct negotiation and I spent an additional 18 hours in bilateral negotiations. I spoke with Dr Jalili, my counterpart, a couple of weeks ago to urge on him the need to make progress and to keep moving on the diplomatic track.</p>
      <p sl="en">The E3+3 will meet during the General Assembly and we are having further contacts. But, at the same time, as the report reminds us, we must not neglect the broader agenda, including human rights and regional security.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we look to our east again – and I have mentioned Serbia, Kosovo and what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina – we have to continue to monitor the situation in Belarus, where the situation on human rights and democracy worries me a great deal. We have a policy of critical engagement and, with our measures, we continue to target those responsible for the crackdown and those associated with it. At the same time, we continue to engage with the people, with civil society and opposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Ukraine, where Helga Schmid, the political director, is meeting today with the opposition parties, we want to see progress on three issues: selective justice, the conduct of free and fair parliamentary elections on 28 October, and the resumption of the delayed reforms in the joint EU-Ukraine Association Agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I look at that part of the world, I am pleased to see what is happening in Moldova. Moving dynamically within our broader Eastern partnership, we will also remain actively engaged in the 5+2 talks on the question of resolving the issues in Transnistria.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we, of course, look at the region and consider too the issues of elections that are moving towards us, especially in Georgia. I met recently with President Saakashvili and we have sent messages to the opposition. We are very clear that we need a good election process and we need to make sure that it is run well. We will have observers there and we will have political support to ensure that the future of Georgia is assured.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also always continuing in our efforts in our relationships with Armenia and Azerbaijan. I visited both in the last few months and I have to say that I deeply regretted the recent decision to pardon Safarov, which went against commitments made by Azerbaijan and which has fuelled tensions in the region. I have expressed, together with Commissioner Füle, our concern. We have been following up on this and our special representative is currently in the region. I know Parliament will debate this on Thursday.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have indicated to you, much of what we do is in partnership. We work in close consultation and cooperation with the United States in our areas of common interest, especially the Western Balkans, the southern neighbourhood, and in the Asia-Pacific, where we met recently with the ASEAN countries and where Secretary Clinton and I held a bilateral meeting on the issues of that region. We remain in touch with the State Department on a daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also going to speak later on about Russia, so I will not say anything further about Russia in this debate in order that we can have a bigger debate later and save time. But, of course, it is critically important that we engage with the people of Russia and that we ensure that we have strong relationships.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I went to China recently, we moved forward in trying to develop the dialogue that we have on global and regional issues. We have agreed a regular dialogue on defence and security policies and we have agreed to strengthen our cooperation on combating piracy. I have already said that, on the work that we do on Iran, we work closely with the E3+3 and China is a key partner in this, as it is also – as I have indicated – in the fight against piracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">But as our relationship with China strengthens, we need to emphasise the importance of universal values and freedoms. During my nine hours of discussion with State Councillor Dai Bingguo, my counterpart, we had a very long discussion and debate on human rights. I brought that into the dialogue that I had with him as well as the dialogue that we had on human rights as a separate discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also with India, we have agreed to hold annual foreign policy consultations where we have a security dialogue, we work together in a Joint Working Group on Counter-Terrorism and where we cooperate on anti-piracy and cybersecurity issues. We have strengthened that relationship dramatically in the last year but, of course, I continue to try to support a solution, working with the Italian Government, for the two marines on trial in India.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our cooperation with our other strategic partners goes on – Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Japan and South Korea. Countries like Mexico and Brazil play an important role in promoting open markets in their region and following the political crisis in Paraguay. In my visits to Brazil, India and South Africa, I have promoted the idea of working together on development and international issues, using the common interests and values that we share, but I have to say that we have more to do on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of the three, I most recently visited South Africa, and I want to say a word on the recent events. While I was in Pretoria, I was able to offer condolences on behalf of the European Union for the loss of life at the Marikana mine. Our thoughts are with the families affected at this terrible time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had the opportunity to discuss this in great detail with both the Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister. I think the South African authorities have taken the necessary steps now to establish the circumstances that led to these tragic events, through a full judicial Commission of inquiry and an inter-ministerial committee to provide assistance and support to the families of those who were killed.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be wrong to speculate and try to anticipate the findings of the Commission, but it is important to examine the root causes as well as the circumstances of these events and, as Mr Brok’s report says, not to neglect the broader issues in our discussions with South Africa and the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is much more that we can do to work closely with regional organisations – organisations like the Arab League, the African Union, ASEAN, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation – and, of course, with the United Nations, both in its broader role and its role in the regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have worked together closely on the future of Libya with the United Nations, the African Union, the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation – an idea that came from me to the Secretary-General – and we worked very closely with organisations, especially the Arab League, on Syria. We have done very practical things to foster this cooperation with the Arab League. For example, we have equipped their crisis room at their headquarters in Cairo which I will be proud to visit and open in November.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we look at all the different geographical areas of the world, we also have to remember that many of the challenges of the world are what we call horizontal – the potential for crisis and conflict because of energy or climate change or water are very real. Last week at the Gymnich, I took the opportunity to talk again with Foreign Ministers about some of these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">We specifically focused on water and education. It was because I recognised that, when we think about the Middle East peace process, water is a final status issue. When we think about what is happening in central Asia, there are real difficulties concerning water. The Sahel, the Nile basin and the Arabian Peninsula are all areas where water plays an incredibly vital role in the potential for conflict and we need to be engaged with that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have said a lot about what we try to do and how we try to do it, but, of course, what really matters is why. We do this to promote and protect human rights and democracy as the guiding principle of our foreign policy. We exist to serve our citizens, to help them be more secure, more able to pursue the lives they want, to give them the right environment and hopefully prosperity, and to help others obtain what we have. I have reported many times the young man in Libya who said, ‘We want what you have every day. You have democracy and freedom’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me end with a quick word on our interinstitutional relations. I think we have strengthened the relationships between this Parliament, the institutions, our senior EEAS officials, myself and others, and that we have tried to respond as quickly and as positively as we can to all requests. I think our information to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and to the Committee on Development is better. The reports and resolutions that are in the Parliament are taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for the idea of the EUSR on human rights. I was very pleased to appoint Stavros Lambrinidis to that role. Thank you for the role that you play in electoral observation missions which are held up across the world as true examples of a way to work with countries and to help support those looking to the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that we can do more and, as we build towards the 2013 review of the decision, I hope that we will be able to show, not only what we have achieved, but also to give some pointers for what more we need to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you to the European Parliament for the support that you have given the service and to me over this last year. I would like to say a special thank you to Mr Brok for his excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets regarding the common foreign and security policy, I would like to support Elmar Brok’s precise and clear position.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The European Union genuinely needs priorities and strategic directions to develop its foreign policy. As foreign policy expenditure is often cut for the benefit of expenditure on internal EU policies, it is clear that we must achieve more with less money and look for ways to spend it as expediently and efficiently as possible.</p>
      <p sl="bg">My personal experience shows that this can be accomplished in several ways. Firstly, by finding synergies between the European civilian, diplomatic, military and development instruments. Secondly, through better planning of the civilian and military operations under the EU’s umbrella, and thirdly, by targeting the financial flows to guarantee the irreversibility of the positive results achieved.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, I am certain that the European Parliament is also of the opinion that a more efficient Europe with regard to the common foreign and security policy can be achieved only if we take credible, joint actions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, on this report on the state of the common foreign and security policy, which cannot be separated from the times that the EU is living in with regard to the debt crisis, the euro crisis and the crisis in European integration.</p>
      <p sl="es">Baroness Ashton, as a bloc we may be the leading global importer of goods and services, we may be the leading global exporter of goods and services, and we may be the leading donor of humanitarian aid, tripling the aid donated by the United States, but what credibility do we have on the international stage, despite your efforts and our own, if we are not capable of solving internal problems with due care and in an effective manner?</p>
      <p sl="es">The new European External Action Service and the new common foreign and security policy have come into being at the most complex time and in the deepest crisis the EU has experienced since it was founded.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that if we want to have a coherent, visible and effective common foreign and security policy, we need to try to answer the questions raised by Mr Brok in his introduction.</p>
      <p sl="es">How do we defend human rights in an international community that considers our Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a westernised view of the world? How do we reconcile the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, laid down in the United Nations Charter, with the principle of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent crises such as that in Syria, which you, Baroness Ashton, said appalled you? How do we identify new partners in line with our world view and how do we work with them, and how do we meet the challenges raised by the Northern and Southern Neighbourhood Policy?</p>
      <p sl="es">It is a difficult task, Baroness Ashton, to solve our external problems, and that is not your responsibility alone, as we will see tomorrow in the debate on the state of the Union. We must start by doing our work internally.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we are now debating again a traditional and important report on our CFSP. This year, its author, Elmar Brok, has decided to break the pattern of this report and introduce a newer approach, less conventional and more strategic in nature, setting a relatively high level of ambition for our CFSP.</p>
      <p sl="en">A first hurdle to overcome has been that of the current situation which compels the EU to be more inward-looking and parsimonious with its means, in other words, while challenges are accumulating, our willingness and capacity to properly deal with them have objectively diminished. Under the circumstances, one wonders whether the level of ambition stated by the report is reflecting a normal situation unaffected by crisis or is attuned to our current difficulties. This is important because, in the first case, we might become unrealistic and, in the second, we might lack credibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">A second hurdle has been the rapid evolution of the international environment, including the one in our direct neighbourhood. The report is inevitably a snapshot of the situation at a certain moment in time, while the international environment is in a state of flux. Therefore, one needs to anticipate and be in front of developments if one wants to stay relevant.</p>
      <p sl="en">A third hurdle is our credibility. Indeed, we have to convince the rest of the world that we continue to be an attractive option, that we can both master our own problems and still pay considerable attention to what happens around us and in the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Inevitably, all these hurdles have influenced the outcome reflected in this report. Thus, time is continuously pressing and we have all had to accommodate ourselves to the new tempo and deal with its novelty. Consequently, there were numerous amendments, too short a time to debate them and reach the inevitable compromises, and last minute amendments which sometimes go beyond and outside the compromise amendments reached previously.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, paying proper attention to this very important report, for which I salute the rapporteur, is indicative of our mission to continue to address properly international, political, economic and military issues in parallel with the efforts to overcome our internal crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, my impression is that systematic cooperation between Member States is starting to work properly – a process which needs careful nurturing if the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) is actually to blossom.</p>
      <p sl="de">But we also need to pick our projects with great care, and if CFSP is in search of a big-picture project on which to focus, it should be, in my view, Russia. We missed the chance, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, properly to engage the Russians as a true partner in European integration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Several false starts and bruised hopes have left our relations fraught and distrustful. Whatever we think of Mr Putin, he is here to stay and Russia is now inside the WTO. So the Union should use its leverage to open up Russia to liberal democracy and to promote fundamental rights there. Gazprom and tourism are not sufficiently broad foundations for building a stable and dynamic relationship which, should we accomplish it, is going to be of great benefit to world politics.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – I accept that the Treaty of Lisbon grants us the powers and competences to grow clusters of core groups of Member States to go further and faster in building up foreign security and indeed defence policies, and I see Libya not only as a great success, but as a forerunner of a practice of reinforced cooperation which we ought to grow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her statement and Mr Brok for his report. As many have already said, our debate is taking place against the background of the most difficult economic, social and political crisis the European Union has experienced. Another consequence of this is that government offices in Europe have insufficient time and energy remaining to tackle the many pressing foreign policy problems. Europe’s far too sluggish reaction to the terrible events in Syria and our far too rapidly declining interest in the democratic transformation of North Africa are just two examples of this. Another example is the very slow development of our delegation office in Tripoli.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe not only lacks time and awareness; it also quite simply lacks money. The financial crisis is bound to have an impact on the budget of foreign ministries as well as the European Parliament budget. In this situation, we must set clear priorities, as must you, Baroness Ashton. In addition to better use of synergies at the European level, for us this can only mean moving away from the often very expensive reaction to escalating crises and moving towards more conflict prevention. After all, civil conflict prevention is the cheapest and most effective means that we Europeans still have at our disposal. However, we have not used this potential enough up to now and our trade, fisheries, agricultural and development policy must finally become conflict sensitive in order for them to assist in preventing conflicts instead of fuelling them. Effective structures are still lacking for this. At the same time, we must strengthen the structures that have just recently been established in the External Action Service for conflict prevention and conflict mediation and broaden their expertise in EU foreign policy as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another very promising approach is the idea of a European Institute for Peace. The Committee on Foreign Affairs will discuss this idea next week with the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt. In this regard, I hope for your support and look forward to your answers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the ECR Group has consistently asserted that CFSP must always be subject to unanimity in the Council. Britain, for instance, is a major military power with a permanent seat in the UN Security Council and must always, of course, retain sovereignty in its foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, we do recognise that the CFSP can play a value added role where Member States’ interests converge, such as over Iran, which is hell-bent on acquiring nuclear weapons and remains probably the greatest threat to global peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">The CFSP is also a useful platform engaging China’s emergence as a global power over issues like North Korea and standing up to Russia where necessary, for instance, over Georgia or its support for Syria in the current insurgency, or engaging within the Quartet to further the Middle East peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I happen to be the rapporteur for the Horn of Africa and again, this is a region with failed states like Somalia and new fragile states like South Sudan and the issue of the emerging role of the African Union. Again, this is an area where the CFSP is a useful tool for the EU and its Member States, to better project their national interests and promote democracy and human rights throughout the globe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, my congratulations to Mr Brok on an excellent job on a very difficult report. I hope that developments post-2013 will not disrupt the status quo at global level to any significant degree and justify the forecasts in the report and by the High Representative. Of course, due to time constraints, I cannot mention all the chapters in the report, but I would like to focus on the question of the Eastern Mediterranean and the southern neighbourhood, which are vital to the European Union. The trend in the West is to focus solely on economic matters and that harbours the risk of ignoring vital geopolitical aspects of the crisis. This has been noted by the important analyst Ian Lesser, who states that Greece is probably going through a crucial economic period and that we should look beyond the numbers. The geostrategic position and significance of Greece are hugely important, given that Greece’s neighbourhood, from the Balkans to the Near East, is entering a very unstable period, with unpredictable consequences in the immediate future. We therefore need to stay on our toes and prevent social tension in Greece. The use of natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean may, moreover, be a factor for security and stability in the Union and may help to achieve energy diversity. The Union needs to move in that direction and you, Lady Ashton, must demonstrate strong political will and fortitude, so that mining rights are granted within Member States’ exclusive economic zones as stipulated under international law.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, may I thank Mr Brok and Baroness Ashton. As you are both aware, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is a critical group that does not agree with the current direction being taken in the area of security and defence policy, because we believe that the time has come to begin a transition towards a model that brings about the demilitarisation of security in order to respond to what is creating insecurity in the world today. Firstly, there is hunger. Seventy thousand people die of hunger every day, while USD 4 billion a day is spent on armaments. Secondly, we have weapons of mass destruction, violence, unemployment and easily curable diseases. That is what we need to respond to in terms of security.</p>
      <p sl="es">That response does not mean increasing military spending or obtaining more weapons and military alliances such as NATO, which can intervene outside the mandate of the United Nations Security Council and carry out campaigns of violence, as took place in Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is important to listen to what our delegate said in her last report on the situation in Iraq, in order to understand that this is not the way forward. The way forward is to initiate a different, demilitarised process, in order to establish – through a redesigned United Nations – the true democratic world government, so as to meet that goal of achieving peace.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when I listen to Baroness Ashton extolling the great successes of the European External Action Service, I am reminded of the movie ‘Forrest Gump’, where a well-meaning but seriously challenged and naive young man finds himself at the centre of events. He was surrounded by the great and the good, but was never really sure of what was going on.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen the faltering and sometimes painful transition to democracy of the long-suffering peoples in the Arab Spring; the ongoing civil war in Syria; fears over nuclear proliferation; the death of Gaddafi; and the return of Putin. These are challenging times in which we are seeing relationships and dynamics redefined. However, at a recent meeting with an exasperated diplomat from the Middle East, he told me that he regarded the High Representative as being more of a hindrance than a help.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all understand that Baroness Ashton drew the short straw. Her role is that of a caretaker of an unformed entity. History is unlikely to remember her in any great detail, but she once found herself elevated to the British House of Lords without ever receiving a single vote in any democratic election. As Forrest Gump pointed out so eloquently, life is like a box of chocolates and we will never know what comes next.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as Coordinator for Security and Defence for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I actually wanted to give you a detailed explanation of how you are, regrettably, not consistently applying the demands made by the European Parliament in the Danjean, Ehler, Gualtieri and Lisek reports. I am sure that some of these Members will do so themselves later.</p>
      <p sl="de">In light of current events, I would, however, like to thank you for having raised the subject of Ukraine and its current political situation. You called it selective justice. I would call what is happening there political justice. Just a few metres away from here, Yulia Tymoshenko and Juri Losenko are fighting for their dignity and their human rights at the European Court of Human Rights. Next weekend, a conference is taking place in Yalta. Commissioner Füle must make very clear here that Europe wants a strong Ukrainian partner. However, the clubs of oligarchs are fearful of politically mature citizens and are afraid of competition and the rules of etiquette and law. The oligarchs’ way leads to exploitation, crime and brutality.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is not the European way. Europe has open societies, a social market economy and the rule of law. We already know that Ukraine will not see free elections. Many types of rigging are already taking place all over the country. We have witnessed hundreds of examples. The fact that leaders of the opposition are being held as political prisoners is a tragedy for freedom and democracy in Europe, in Ukraine and in Belarus. In our southern neighbourhood, we are witnessing the end of many autocratic regimes and the democratic spring, at least to a certain extent.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, please go to Yalta. Talk about the political spring which must finally break down old structures and give people confidence in a democratic future in this part of Europe, too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Lady Ashton, as we point out in this report, the consistency and coherence of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) requires political leadership and coordination, ensuring that European policies such as trade and development are in line with CFSP principles, values and strategic interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ethiopia – an ACP partner, a major recipient of EU aid, the second most populous country in Africa and headquarters of the African Union – has been without a government since the dictator, Meles Zenawi, died in July, much earlier than the totalitarian clique announced to the people of Ethiopia. This delay allowed them to secretly engineer the perpetuation of their oppressive regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fortunately, yesterday, two Swedish journalists imprisoned by Meles were finally released. But we did not hear the EU pressing for their release, and we did not hear it pressing for the release of all the other thousands of Ethiopian political prisoners, including Eskinder Nega, recipient of PEN America’s ‘Freedom to Write’ award.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can you tell us about your endeavours in that regard? Why is the EU so silent or at least so discreet in calling for the liberation of Ethiopians? And can you tell us what the EU is doing to press for an inclusive political dialogue involving all opposition parties, including the armed ones, so that Ethiopia may remain unified and not fall into violence, so that Ethiopia may now find that genuine road to democracy to which its people aspire and not go on oppressed by these totalitarian forces?</p>
      <p sl="en">Ethiopia is too important for Africa and for the world for us to continue to turn a blind eye to what is going on there.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I just want to tell you that Baroness Ashton and her services worked to free the two Swedish journalists, and I was witness to that. I myself went to Ethiopia several weeks ago, at the request of Baroness Ashton and on the basis of the information she provided, to intervene for the release of the two journalists. While I was there, I met with Prime Minister Meles, with the full agreement and full support of Baroness Ashton. I met the prisoners. The Swedish Foreign Minister also made every effort. I want to testify here to Baroness Ashton’s actions to free these prisoners. I believe that if we had not taken these steps, in complete confidentiality, the prisoners might not be free today. I wanted to say this because I know how passionate you are about Ethiopia and I wanted the truth to be heard. Therefore, do not say that Baroness Ashton did not do anything: she did a great deal and we supported her.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, so far, the debate here today shows clearly, Baroness Ashton, how impossible your task is. Some people have asked you to clearly define your priorities and concentrate on priority actions, while others have asked you questions about everything that is going on around the world and urged you to do everything you can to improve the situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, your task is also inspiring and we support you because together – but above all you and your team, who do the lion’s share – we are laying the foundations for an entirely new common policy: the European Union’s common security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am one of those who naturally would like the entire world to have realised this already, and I think that it will come to realise it over time. Having said that, I had a somewhat miserable experience along with my colleagues who were also in Charlotte, North Carolina last week during the Democratic Convention: the European Union was not mentioned once during either the Convention or the International Leaders Forum. Mr Brok writes in his report that the United States is our main strategic partner – and that is certainly true – but the fact remains that we were not even mentioned once. That leads me to conclude that we still have an enormous amount of work to do.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, thank you for those words, Baroness Ashton, and it is true that one can see from your work that you have put in a great deal of effort and that this has begun to produce results, and this leads us to certain conclusions. The first conclusion, in my opinion, is that the banner of democracy will have some problems in the East this autumn, as elections will be taking place in Georgia and Ukraine. We have a great need for political support, and I have already written to you about this. We also need support for non-governmental organisations and for observer missions. If we want to be involved again in this great historical project in the East and say: ‘yes, it is possible for you to become European Union members’, then we must specify the criteria today that will be used to assess the elections. For this reason, the principal motto is democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second issue, which is very difficult and which requires your personal involvement, is freedom, particularly in the context of religious freedom. We are very concerned by what is happening in Syria. We cannot allow the events in Syria to be part of a final solution for the issue of Eastern Christians, who have always lived there and where they have their home. You should have said something about this today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The third issue is energy, but there is no more time for this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, both the German Foreign Minister and his French counterpart believe that it is unacceptable for Iran to possess nuclear weapons. What consequences does the European Union foresee might arise from this position if the negotiations with the Iranian regime remain unsuccessful – as is currently the case? That is my first question to Lady Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam High Representative, in a press release last Saturday, you were quoted on the European sanctions policy with reference to the Islamic Republic of Iran. You talked about the need to check whether European sanctions are being circumvented or even ignored. Do you have any concrete evidence that this is actually the case?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the day before yesterday, a South African boer, Johan Fourie, and his wife, Cecile, were murdered in an horrific manner. The police are saying that this was one of the worst crime scenes they have ever seen.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The media in Europe are paying no attention to this, but Johan and Cecile Fourie are not merely isolated cases. Since the ANC came to power, more than 3 000 farmers have been murdered in South Africa. There is a pattern to these killings. They are usually accompanied by long hours of torture. There is usually little theft. So, it has nothing to do with poverty. These people are murdered simply because of who they are.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is a political problem, because there are important forces in and around the ANC that are contributing to these killings. The government and the police are doing virtually nothing. The imminent land reform is threatening to exacerbate the situation still further. So, we need more than just a letter in order to address these issues. We need sanctions and we need measures.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are all aware of the extent of your task and the difficulties involved in coordinating the Member States, which are highly sensitive about their diplomatic and military prerogatives. That requires us to be somewhat lenient and to recognise willingly that you do not spare any efforts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, it is impossible for us today not to express a degree of disappointment or even frustration, and this is clearly expressed in the Brok report, which underlines the lack of any clear sense of strategic priorities for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your commendable objective is the implementation of the comprehensive approach, which should give the European Union added value on the international stage. However, I must admit that the approach seems, above all, to be global in its dimension and, I was going to say, in its geographical scope.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want to be everywhere, all the time, one sometimes wonders what the European Union actually does and where it really exercises successful global capabilities. You rightly mentioned the Horn of Africa; it is true that the EU is putting all of its resources, including its military resources, to work there, and it is still a success, but a limited success.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The CFSP really has to get away from the fragmented, divided initiatives that take shape in response to emergencies and new situations and which concentrate on a hierarchy of priorities and truly coherent mobilisation of all of its instruments.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Brok’s statements and with his report, which see progress in the development of the European External Action Service. This, together with your personal action, is starting to give shape and identity to the EU’s common foreign and security policy and external action, along the lines of a global multilateral approach based on plural instruments, which is the only possible way to face the challenges of the world today.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this framework, I believe that the balanced approach you have taken on delicate issues such as those of Syria and Iran, based on a correct awareness of the delicate network of interdependence and on the contradiction between state and national religion that characterises the Middle East, is commendable.</p>
      <p sl="it">That said, there is clearly a long way to go towards a better identification of the priorities, which are to strengthen the unity of intent of the Member States, strengthen European defence and develop the parliamentary dimension of the common foreign and security policy, both in terms of parliamentary control of the spirit and the letter of Article 36, and of strengthening the potential of parliamentary diplomacy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that in these areas, too, we can work together, not least in preparation for the review of the decision establishing the External Action Service, towards which we will work constructively.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Vice-President/High Representative and Elmar Brok deserve congratulations on making a lot out of very little. There is hardly an area of the world, apparently, where EU intervention is not seen as the most vital contribution and the solution to all problems. It is almost as if no other international organisation or government exists.</p>
      <p sl="en">The CFSP report’s favourite mantra is ‘human rights’. They are mentioned 43 times, as if they are some sort of unique prerogative of the European Union. Our friends are ignored or get scant mention. That great democracy and emerging power, India, is reduced to three lines in a report of 30 pages. Another emerging power, Turkey, gets similar treatment. No positive engagement, no mention of all the positive changes that have taken place, of the support it needs in dealing with the refugee influx from Syria, or of the potentially key role it plays in the region. We see the old sore of a UN Security Council seat reopened, and now the curious idea is raised of an EU-US transatlantic political council explicitly to run in parallel with NATO. The world is moving on, while the EU seems to live in some sort of bubble. It needs radical change.</p>

I am a great supporter of human rights but it is not the be-all and end-all and it is not the be-all and end-all of what we are doing. Our priorities at the moment should be economic resurgence and the security of our nations. These are where the priorities should be and, in our dealings with foreign countries, that is where we should put the priority, and by lecturing countries like India when we are trying to arrange a free trade agreement between the European Union and India, all we do is create difficulties and problems over so-called human rights issues and inclusion issues and all these sorts of things, which is decidedly unhelpful. Let us get our priorities right.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we know that the security challenges of our times are very different to those of the past: cyber crime, uncontrolled flows of migrants and refugees, international terrorism and the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are just a few examples. If we consider the Middle East, for example, we know that violence will not help to put an end to the dispute concerning the Iranian nuclear programme. If Israel were to attack the nuclear installations, the whole of the Middle East could descend into war and chaos.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the EU is serious about keeping the peace, it must undeniably act as a mediator between the parties to the dispute. The consequences of a war in the region, where the anticipated refugee flows and the security of oil supply are concerned, for example, would undoubtedly be felt very strongly in Europe. Peace and stability in the region can only be achieved through general disarmament, and Brussels must therefore exert pressure on both sides to this aim. Of course, Israel’s right to exist should be beyond doubt, and Tehran has to lay its cards on the table with regard to its controversial nuclear programme.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, while I would like to express my appreciation of the efforts you have made recently, I would once again like to emphasise what is perhaps our main expectation of the common foreign and security policy. Mr Brok’s report clarifies this in a passage which states that ‘the EU’s ability to influence the international order depends not only on coherence among its policies, but also on a real strategic concept of EU foreign policy, which must unite and coordinate all Member States behind the same set of priorities so that they speak with a single voice’.</p>
      <p sl="it">Baroness Ashton, the problem for us is precisely this. What is your strategy for imposing priorities on the Member States? The crisis has taught us that we need to set priorities if we are come out of it, which is what we have done with banking union, fiscal union and monetary union towards a political union.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is your strategy with regard to foreign policy issues? How can we make progress towards an EU foreign policy which, while I would not call it federal, will show us that we have set precise priorities to which all the EU Member States will feel subject?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I also endorse President Brok, in particular, in what he said about the collaboration between national parliaments and the European Parliament, which shows that Europe’s common policy does not replace, but rather advances, our initial objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome, too, what the High Representative is doing more than 43 times a year on human rights, her appointment of the new Special Representative, her work, with our support, to end the death penalty for juveniles in Thailand – as was achieved just yesterday – and her bringing forward of the concept of ‘education in a suitcase’ for the world’s seven million refugee children, which shows that children’s rights are human rights. I would ask the Conservatives how human rights can be universal but not for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome what the High Representative said at the start of the debate about Europe’s ‘tin hut’ in Mogadishu. Normally, it is dictators who are ‘tin-pot’, but she demonstrates that European diplomacy has the agility, quite literally, of a ‘cat on a hot tin roof’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, and seriously, I ask the High Representative once again what progress is being made towards an EU common position on referring Syrian war crimes to the International Criminal Court? Europe delayed the formal pursuit of justice in the former Yugoslavia, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Sudan, and subsequently changed its mind. On Syria, the time for delay is gone.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the report on the structure of the European Union’s common foreign policy contains many clauses concerning a common security and defence policy. In addition, the report repeats calls for Member States to intensify cooperation on matters of defence and to implement the potential of the EU’s armaments policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is somewhat strange is that there is only one paragraph in the document that is devoted to cultural and religious dialogue. After all, foreign policy does not just mean armed intervention, but also an extension of the values on which the European Union is based. The clause about supporting dialogue and understanding between different religions and cultures which, as we read in the report, ‘should be an integral part of our external engagement with third countries’, does not go far enough in the context of mass persecutions of Christians around the world. In her speech, Baroness Ashton also omitted this issue. The European Union grew from Christian roots and should be more ambitious in approaching this issue, and should give it the weight it deserves.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, given that foreign and security policy is such a broad subject, I shall focus on three basic ideas.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the EU’s external action should be ambitious. I want the European Union to be a major player in a global, complex, increasingly multipolar world, and it is also possible that we shall soon see something of a withdrawal in the external action of the United States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, size counts in foreign policy; as Europeans, we are stronger together than apart, and this ambitious perspective for Europe is reflected in Mr Brok’s solid report, which we shall adopt tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, the Treaty of Lisbon provided new tools for this policy. I am referring to the position you hold, Baroness Ashton, as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission. As you also chair the Foreign Affairs Council, it will now be easier to achieve unity, continuity and consistency in the Union’s foreign policy. In addition, you have a new instrument, the European External Action Service, into which diplomats from Member States have been incorporated, who will use their experience in foreign policy to enrich a vision that is more focused on issues related to economics, trade and cooperation by officials from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, a true EU foreign policy not only takes time but also needs two basic conditions to be met: the new bodies of the Treaty of Lisbon should be ambitious, working with the purpose of leading the 27 Member States, not just accompanying them or finding lowest common denominators; secondly, the Member States should be aware of the need to work together on foreign policy, acting in a spirit of compromise and taking a constructive approach.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the debt crisis troubling numerous Member States and uncertainty about the future of the euro area are, without doubt, affecting the Union’s image and calling its ability to play an essential role on the international stage into question. I do not therefore think that this is the time for grandiose but empty pronouncements. The Union needs to find its feet again and set realistic targets based on its actual abilities. The fact that this year’s European Parliament report on foreign and security policy calls quite explicitly for the Union to determine such strategic priorities is important. As Parliament’s rapporteur on enlargement, I should like to make a point of thanking the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his constructive stand on enlargement issues. I should also like to express my satisfaction at the clear statement that the European Parliament unwaveringly supports the European prospects of every European state that respects the values of the Union and is prepared to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. Enlargement is a huge success in the field of external action and must remain one of the most important tools in the Union’s toolbox.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, this report calls for clearer political priorities and strategic lines, and I agree with it. At the same time, however, it does not seem to me that we are taking the same approach to the same problems. For example, we cannot advocate territorial integrity and an end to occupation for certain countries, but disregard the same thing in other countries. We must take the same approach with everyone. It is disgraceful that a country that is engaged in partnership with the EU is occupying territories of another country, and it is even worse that a number of resolutions on the withdrawal of the occupying troops are not being respected.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The other thing that I would like to insist on is clearer leadership with regard to the Balkans. Many of the Balkan states do not have sufficiently strong leadership, and so they rightly expect us to show this strong leadership. We cannot make the same mistake that we made at the beginning of the 1990s. We cannot just mediate; we also need to be able to lead. Otherwise, our position and the whole enlargement process could be put at risk.</p>

      <p sl="en">This is a good time for our debate. The crisis in Europe has constrained the EU’s ability to react more effectively to many recent foreign developments. But if there is one thing we cannot afford to lose in this process, it is our leadership on certain foreign policy issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we have achieved some successes in the Western Balkans: in Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. Many more issues, however, have remained unresolved for quite a long time. We need to react promptly and to take leadership in the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue, in the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in the many challenges in Albania and Macedonia.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, at this time especially, the EU has to play a strategic role in this region. It is our responsibility and our duty to have an effective and clear policy towards it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would, of course, like to congratulate Mr Brok on a thorough and sincere report, but I would also like to thank the High Representative for the open discussions with us and for the discussion two days ago in Cyprus with the heads of the European Union’s Committee on Security and Defence and a delegation from the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is needed, and what comes out in many discussions, including our own with politicians from outside Europe for example, is that we are still unable to resolve certain problems within Europe. The Americans and Chinese say ‘fine, you are taking care of the whole world but you still have unresolved problems in the Caucasus, in Nagorno-Karabakh, and there is still the Transnistrian problem’. These should really be priority issues for our foreign policy, for the foreign policy of the European Union over the coming months and years, because it is time to make progress in these areas. Of course, we are all aware that in many cases, this will require hard and difficult discussions with Russia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, for emphasising the role that the European Parliament has to play in foreign and security policy. Elmar Brok said that you cannot use tanks to deal with crises. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on this. At the same time, I would like to note that, as the European Union, we have a certain know-how. This includes dialogue on human rights issues, humanitarian aid and development aid. Armed intervention comes as a last resort and only under a UN mandate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to point out that we have appointed a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights and we are also in the process of finalising the creation of a European Fund for Democracy. These may be the instruments that have been asked for by representatives from Mogadishu in Somalia or from other parts of the world, who want to build democracy.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the Council’s report maps the EU’s foreign policy priorities, but it does not, in my view, pay enough attention to the priorities and strategic guidelines for the common foreign and security policy. Moreover, it does not clarify the policy mechanisms for ensuring coherence and consistency among the different components of foreign policy, including those under the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EU urgently needs to achieve greater synergies based upon your triple-hatted mandate, Baroness Ashton. In your speech, Baroness Ashton, you talked of many things that have succeeded, of many interventions that have helped.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would now like to ask you to intervene on behalf of the son of a European, a citizen of the Slovak Republic. Four years ago, her son was in Egypt. It is a country that you mentioned, where we helped Egyptian women. Here, too, at this plenary session, I would also like to ask my colleagues, Members of Parliament and you, from the perspective of your mandate and with the power of your mandate, to help Katarína Azab get little Adamko back to Slovakia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to make a couple of comments on the report, on the part concerning Asia.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the report calls for elimination of the inconsistencies between Member State and European Union priorities as regards the human rights in China. I trust in the staunch belief of all parties in the inviolability of human rights and expect them to vigorously address the situation in Tibet and East Turkestan, and that of the human rights activists in the People’s Republic of China, at meetings with their Beijing counterparts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, Taiwan has made serious efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Asia/Pacific region and I hope that the EU will support the East China Sea peace initiative, which encourages peaceful and cooperative solutions to the disputes between Japan, Taiwan and mainland China. I also regret that this report does not touch on the Russian Federation’s obligations to withdraw from the Georgia-occupied territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and I believe that the High Representative will keep that in her sights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is reason to hope that the countries of Europe, with their ancestral and cultural ties, have overcome their inherited rivalries and grievances. However, I do not see that as a legacy of the European Union, but of an entirely understandable revulsion of the loss of life during two world wars and later conflicts. The emergence of common threats and challenges have led to a convergence of the interests of the nation states of Europe, whether within or outside the borders of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are undergoing a neo-colonial challenge from Third World immigration, our industries and our jobs are threatened by the emergent economies and our cultural values are threatened by aggressive religious predators. However, convergence does not mean congruence. Our interests are not identical, we have distinct alliances, friendships and interests of both kinds that are attributable to ancestral and historical differences. A presumption of common interest where none exists will be unsuccessful and even counterproductive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Ms Ashton, the CSDP’s military and civilian missions have always been part of a larger international commitment, and they have only rarely brought about a real improvement in the situation on the ground. Their function was always more to indicate to NATO and the United States that the EU is in a position to take on security policy missions. Only in a few instances, such as Somalia, Georgia and Macedonia, was efficient crisis management achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the future, Member States should discuss and reach a decision on the following key documents prepared by the European External Action Service. On the one hand, there is a new security strategy and, on the other hand, a European White Paper on security and defence policy defining what military and civilian tasks the EU will take on, where it will intervene, how the necessary capabilities will be provided, and how Member States’ resources can be committed to these purposes. In doing so, the CSDP must become more efficient at offering clear added value.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is increasingly being called upon to play an important role in the geopolitical changes that are affecting vast areas of the world.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that it is ever more urgent to raise the profile and quality of foreign policy, especially because many of these changes are taking place not far from Europe. To achieve this, we need to convince the Member States to invest in European common foreign policy, thereby reinforcing the choices made in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">Baroness Ashton, we need to move from the current activism – which cannot be denied and is manifest in the many trips you have made to every corner of the world – towards a more central role that will not only leave its mark, but will also adjust the existing equilibrium in favour of European foreign policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Ashton. Today is certainly a happy day in my home country of Sweden. It has been mentioned that the two reporters were released in Ethiopia yesterday and are back home. This, of course, gives me the opportunity to ask Ms Ashton: have you received any new information about Dawit Isaak in the neighbouring country of Eritrea? He has now been imprisoned without a trial in Asmara, Eritrea, for 4 000 days and nights – nearly eleven years. Do you have any new information?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, a lot has been dutifully praised, while some things have been gently criticised. I sense that our foreign policy consists mainly of moaning about problems and, at most, imposing sanctions where it is easy to do so. I regret the absence of a fully robust, economic, socio-political, geostrategic approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to illustrate this with the example of Mogadishu. Our warships in Mogadishu have undoubtedly dealt with one of the symptoms in the short-run. However, the roots of piracy – the destruction of the livelihoods of those working in agriculture and fisheries – have not been dealt with. The competitor, China, is happy about this. It secures whole tracts of land for its products and secures, too, the fishing rights, protecting these off the Somali coast. Europe, then, deals with the negative impacts of all of this: mass migration, piracy, humanitarian disasters and the spread of Islamic fundamentalism. That is not how I imagine a common security policy. We need a change of mindset here. I do not even really need an EEAS for that.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, everything that Lady Ashton has said makes me very optimistic and I do not doubt either her disposition or her intentions. However, I have a very specific and very clear question: where are we going, how are we to proceed and how is the federalisation or constitutionalisation of the European Union to be implemented? Thus, the one thing that we need to achieve is effectiveness, constitutionalisation and a common foreign, defence and security policy.</p>

    <intervention id="2-573-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Catherine Ashton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, it has certainly been an interesting debate, with a complete range of views and thoughts on every aspect of the common foreign and security policy, and indeed a couple on me.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to start with something that was said about the need to ensure economic resurgence and the security of the needs of our people. I agree with that. It is important to recognise that the purpose of trying to collaborate effectively on foreign and security policy is, above everything, to support the needs of our own people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Making sure that we bring prosperity is about trade deals and about economic opportunity. It is also about ensuring that others get economic opportunity – to their benefit and to ours. Ensuring that we have a secure and safer planet, especially in our neighbourhood, is also about ensuring that we have safety and security for our own people. Countries that are close to Syria or which are experiencing the challenges of transition in the southern neighbourhood know this only too well, because they saw people trying to flee from terrible tragedy and to come and stay in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there are many ways in which that is precisely what this is all about. When people got together and said what we need is a common foreign and security policy, it was because they saw not that Member States were not able to do things individually, but that there were many things they could do better together.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a very simple proposition and nobody should get hysterical about what that means for sovereignty or this, that and the other. It is about what makes sense when you do things together, and indeed a number of honourable Members pointed to good examples.</p>
      <p sl="en">I tried to show, in describing this comprehensive approach which is a strategic approach, that actually it is not just about dealing with conflict. Conflict needs to be dealt with, but it is also about what you do before and what you do afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, our engagement with Libya will not just be for this year; it will be for the years to come until we are confident and they are confident that they have built the institutions that they need, that they have got political security. By the way, they are looking at the diversification of their economy and they are worrying about what has happened to weapons that have gone south from Libya into the Sahel.</p>
      <p sl="en">I could give you example after example of what we do. What we do is we work on conflict prevention and we work on how to support peace building and we work together, 27 Member States around the Foreign Affairs Council who do things where they agree, and where they agree they give me the mandate to operate on their behalf. Everybody should welcome and celebrate that because that is about recognition by all of them that there is something more to be done where we work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree, by the way, with Ms Neynsky about the need to have greater synergy. Absolutely. We look for that all the time. There is something about trying to set up a new service in an economic crisis that means you have to think in cleverer ways about the use of resources and you have to work together. That applies in defence, where we are pooling and sharing and where we are looking at the results of Libya that showed us we needed to do more about refuelling in mid-air and where we are working directly with NATO. We are also looking at the synergy of Member States collaborating in buildings across the world, where sharing common services makes more sense for the diplomatic service or where, by doing things together, we can have more impact and we can support countries more effectively because we are not all trying to do the same thing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Countries and Foreign Ministers say to me quite often, please, we do not want to have a procession of different ministers coming. Can we not just talk with the European Union and then you spread out the message of what we need, because every time somebody else comes, it is more time that they cannot spend on the things that matter. So this is about making sense of doing it together – planning better, working together effectively, not taking away but adding value to what Member States do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree as well that you have to think strategically, and I mean by that not just geographically, but horizontally. Water, energy, education: there are big issues that I have already pointed to and which really do affect not just the lives of other people but ultimately, ours too. Ensuring the quality of water for children and for adults across the world has an impact. It has an impact on us and it has an impact, more importantly, on them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there is ensuring the provision of water, with all the complexity of what is now happening on the Nile and the desire for different countries to use water in different ways. There are enormous challenges in that region. We can help to support them to work out – and they ask us to support them to work out – how to deal with that, being aware of the challenges of water in areas where this can lead to conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have got to be clear, as I said, about what we offer and we have got to be clear about what we offer across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say specifically to Ms Gomes, about Ethiopia – and I will also be speaking on Eritrea briefly – that we have worked incredibly hard (and I was very grateful to Louis Michel) on trying to resolve the issue not just of the Swedish journalists but of many others. I explained earlier on about the need to engage with countries and with politicians, as well as to be clear about our expectations of them. We have done that and we have sought, and will continue to seek, an inclusive approach to what happens in Ethiopia.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will also say, because now I can, that the Swedish Government asked us not to make a lot of noise in our work to try and release the hostages, the journalists. That is also very important. Sometimes I think people forget that when you are trying to get people out, occasionally you have to do it more quietly, because that is what is going to have greatest effect and impact. We will send you a comprehensive list of all the demarches and letters that will show you everything we have done on Ethiopia. Do not leap to the assumption that just because you do not hear about something, it does not mean it is not happening, because every day we are working on a whole raft of issues and it is important that you realise that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not have any more information, Mr Schmidt, on what is happening with the poor gentlemen who is in Eritrea, David. We have been in touch with them as you know. We have delivered the habeas corpus that you asked us to do and we are still trying to get as much information as possible, but it is incredibly difficult. As you said, and as has been said in Commission meetings, 4 000 days is a horrendous amount of time for him. We will continue the efforts that we are making with others, because the partnership that we have with countries like the United States and others is really important.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just two more quick points. Strategically, we work with everyone. It is not about the EU being the greatest thing on earth that only works by itself. Absolutely not. Most of what we do is in partnership with others, with Member States for sure, with the United Nations, with the Arab League, with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, with the ASEAN countries and with others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Think about how one tackles the challenges of a country like Burma/Myanmar. When I met with Aung San Suu Kyi, she talked about the need for us to coordinate because, as a country, they find it very difficult to deal with so many offers and with the many competing opportunities that businesses wish to have in their country, and they need help. They do not have the infrastructure, they do not have the knowledge, they do not have the systems. That is where we can offer support to countries to meet the challenge to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final point is about priorities. I agree, I set out three: build a service – bring people from eight buildings into one; develop the delegations – bring the Lisbon Treaty to life in terms of what we do on the ground; and work in our neighbourhoods, where we should be judged and have the strongest strategic partnerships possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those are my priorities for my mandate. I still believe in them and that is what I do every day.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just as has been shown in this debate, every day there are other issues that people believe should be number one on the agenda. In the course of this debate, you have covered every continent and you have covered a huge number of countries into which you individually believe we should put our energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you that it is about trying to be effective across the world, working with others. We will continue to do that. We will not be scatter-gun, but will be effective and efficient in what we do. As things grow, this will get better and better.</p>
      <p sl="en">All I would say is: do not be patient for the wrong reasons, but recognise that we are absolutely at the beginning.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to take up your final remarks regarding added value. We need to develop for ourselves a clear strategy on the issue of how Europe will fit into the new world order. If we do not do that – if we do not know where we want to position ourselves – we will only ever act reactively. We often conduct foreign policy like day-to-day politics, barging in unprepared, and often we operate merely reactively with these issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is also linked to the fact that – in addition to the shortcomings that we still have in the European Union – the Member States are often unwilling to cooperate. Listening to some of our British colleagues here, it appears that they have yet to comprehend the added value of working together and that no European state is able to improve their position in the world single-handedly. This needs to be clear. We want to have a common position not only in terms of consular services, but also with the large strategic tasks.</p>
      <p sl="de">How are we in a position to integrate the transatlantic community, also with the inclusion of South America, to point to one strategic concept? What about the relationship with Asian development? We also need to make clear that a preventative approach is the right one to take, Mr Van Orden. We champion our interests together, and only by working together are we in a position to enforce these. It is necessary, however, that we do this while considering human rights, justice and social equilibrium in this world. In North Africa, we have seen all too often that stability alone is not the solution. Stability only exists where it is linked with law, human rights and social justice. Only in this way can we elevate our position in the world order.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to work harder together to carve out this overall strategy. It is not an overall strategy if each of the 27 foreign ministers hurries to Tahrir Square together with a camera team to show that they themselves invented the Arab Spring. That is not an approach which can be used to take Europe forward.</p>

      <p sl="es">Maintaining international peace and security is one of the EU’s primary objectives. Currently, in our struggle to achieve democratic stability, we should not forget Latin America, which is facing important challenges, as already mentioned: democratic consolidation, regional integration, economic and social stability, poverty and, of course, security in the region. On the other hand, our Latin American neighbours share our values and principles, and they have a number of emerging countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which are key members of international forums such as the G20; finally, the region has great economic potential, with 10% growth forecast for the coming decade. In view of this, I believe that next autumn, the European External Action Service should focus strongly on the multi-party trade agreement between Peru, Colombia and the EU, the association agreement with Central America, and the negotiation of the development cooperation instrument. This is a key region for the EU, and we cannot gradually withdraw right when it is expanding the most. In conclusion, the EU is, and should become, even more aware and involved in conflict prevention and the struggle to maintain security.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, who managed to draft a truly well-structured and clear report on this rather broad and complex subject. I believe that the report to be adopted represents another important milestone in the close cooperation between the European Parliament and the European External Action Service in respect of the European Union’s common foreign and security policy. I am pleased to note that as a result of the motions for amendment I submitted, the report reinforced the human rights dimension of the issue, as well as the protection of the rights of minorities. Additionally, a separate paragraph was added to the text, calling attention to the serious violations of human rights in the labour and political prison camps in North Korea. The report thus calls on the competent bodies of the EU to pay increased attention to this region, and to provide appropriate support and assistance to the victims. I have already expressed this in several of my speeches, and I would like to stress it once again: the human rights dimension is inevitable, and must be a decisive factor in EU foreign policy; it must serve as a guiding principle for the External Action Service, the Commission and the Council as well. I believe that Parliament is a leader in putting this principle into practice and this report, too, contributes to this objective.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome this extremely thorough and comprehensive report. I would like to add two minor comments regarding the sections on security policy. Among our strategic and budgetary priorities, more emphasis should be given to the objective that foreign and security policy should promote action against terrorism and organised crime by all means available. This action is an important prerequisite for close and continuous cooperation between external and internal security agencies, which is still wanting in respect of external security. My other comment concerns our relations with Russia. The report is correct in noting that one of the requirements of a good partnership with this country is respect for human rights in Russia. At the same time, I found the report lacking in that it did not demand that the Russian State assist the fight against Russian and Russian-speaking organised crime not just in word, but in deed. One example I could name is Russian cyber crime, which has by now grown into an international mafia. Many analysts believe that Russian or Russian-speaking cyber criminals sometimes receive covert funding from Russian state agencies. I believe that one of the essential conditions of our partnership with Russia should be more sincere and more efficient cooperation on the part of Russia in fighting crime.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU needs to become more vocal, more visible and act as a global leader rather than silent donor. This report provides concrete aspects on how to make the CFSP more efficient, better coordinated and focused and I advise the HR/VP to make full use of these suggestions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I underline the importance of EU-US relations as a cornerstone of EU foreign policy and our priority partnership on the global arena. The EU has to step up its efforts in deepening the relations both in rhetoric and also in concrete actions, especially in the light of forthcoming presidential elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">Relations with Russia have to be strictly conditional. The EU must demand from Russia to fully respect human rights and the rule of law based on international treaties and its international commitments. The new EU-Russia agreement has to be based on concrete achievements and not hurry into a solely economic agreement forgetting human rights and civil liberties. The EU has to strictly condemn the current politically motivated court cases and demand this practice to stop immediately. I welcome the rapporteur’s amendments calling for stronger EU involvement in finding solutions to ‘frozen’ conflicts, especially the Russian occupied South Ossetia and Abkhazia territories, and calling for Russia to respect the territorial and constitutional integrity of its regional neighbours.</p>

      <p sl="en">We will never be able to be efficient or have a proper vision of our external action as long as we fail to understand the fact that our values cannot be promoted until we manage to resolve our geostrategic problems. This is not about abandoning our values. It is about creating a framework for them to grow roots and flourish. The primacy we currently give to the values does not reflect our attachment to them, but our incapacity to define the geostrategic interests of the EU. Since we do not know our identity, we do not know our interests and we cannot define our long-term objectives. This is why we prefer to fight an illusory crusade that gives us the false impression of being capable of imposing our model around the world, believing that this solves all of our other problems. Until we change this approach, we cannot have a real common foreign and security policy. What is worse, since our foreign policy is not the goal but rather the means, through its lack we condemn ourselves to irrelevance within the international competition.</p>

      <p sl="en">The common foreign and security policy has been both criticised and heralded as a meagre or great achievement of the EU. At this stage, we can observe and wait for the CFSP to prove its worth in practice. At the same time, we can witness the already generic rhetoric of the need for the EU to talk with a single voice. There is an imbalance between theory and practice, obviously. The most poignant example came from France in the shape of a Mistral warship – which was sold to Russia. Ceterum censeo , France has decided to sell a Mistral-class warship to Russia; we believe that it will sincerely regret its action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, 18 months of fighting have seen over 25 000 people dead in Syria, with many countless more made homeless or injured by the situation. August was the bloodiest month since the conflict began, and we have all recognised the appalling human rights violations and the destruction of the infrastructure of the country and of its cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in terms of humanitarian needs has got worse. We have over 230 000 refugees who have escaped into neighbouring countries and 2.5 million inside Syria are in need of assistance, of which 1.5 million are displaced. Still today, massacres continue and we see no end to the plight of so many innocent Syrians.</p>
      <p sl="en">I begin by saying to you that the humanitarian track is an absolute priority. We have to work closely with the neighbouring countries to coordinate and help in the massive challenge of refugees leaving and those who are displaced internally. Over these last two or three days, I have spoken yet again to the Foreign Ministers of Turkey and Jordan. I also met the Prime Minister of Lebanon to talk about the challenges that they face and to try and offer additional support.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think Turkey is doing a very impressive job in hosting the refugees, but they are flowing in greater numbers and that is becoming a big difficulty. As the Foreign Minister said to me, it takes a month to build a camp properly but only a very short time to fill it. Refugees, particularly those in Jordan and Lebanon, are being hosted outside camps – in families, in schools – and it is having a greater impact, too, on the services that they need to offer and there is a real need for increased support.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have seen that Commissioner Georgieva announced over the weekend an additional EUR 50 million of humanitarian funding, which puts us at the point of a contribution from the Commission of EUR 168 million and a total of EUR 240 million across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also really important, as well as providing the resources, a lot of which is going through NGOs that are providing absolutely vital support on the ground, that we have assisted the Syrian Humanitarian Forum, which exists under the leadership of the United Nations, and that we are providing support for civil society through our neighbourhood policy instruments, both internally and to those who have fled to neighbouring countries, to try and help them to develop and support the civil society needs across the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said, we have children that we are supporting in Jordan and in Lebanon, through the UN High Commission for Refugees, to help the capacity of the institutions and local communities that are working with about 300 schools to support children who are now coming in and who need school. As I have said many times before, we should never underestimate the importance of school and education for children who are traumatised by these terrible circumstances and of helping them to have some sense of normality in their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we have suspended all our work with the Syrian Government but have stepped up assistance through the human rights organisations in the fields of activists; the networking and advocacy and a number of our contracts in Syria are still in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are still preparing additional funds in order to be able to support the humanitarian relief across all the things that I mentioned – education, food, water, support for people and organisational support. But as you will be the first to say to me, that is not going to end the crisis and we face a very dangerous stalemate with each side seeming to be convinced that the war may turn to their advantage. There could be more violence and suffering and the most radical elements on all sides will become stronger, bringing further militarisation and the risk of sectarian violence. We also are aware of the threat of chemical weapons, and that is being monitored extremely closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the truth is that, despite all the efforts, the international community is, in a sense, at a deadlock. The six-point plan has not been implemented, the UN Security Council has not been able to agree on a common response that could open the way for a political solution. And the opposition, in spite of some real progress which we felt was being made in Cairo at the beginning of July under the supervision of the Arab League, remains fragmented. We do not yet have a real alternative to the regime in power and an alternative that is truly inclusive, something that I know that honourable Members feel very strongly about.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is obvious that the regime is so clearly responsible for the conflict and that the parties have to do everything possible to find a solution, but we have a collective responsibility and we cannot wait. One would argue that the Syrian people have waited for far too long and this stalemate could drag on, which would have impacts not only on the terrible things that are happening in Syria but beyond into the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The priority we have to have, beyond continuing to provide humanitarian aid and support, increasing it, working with Member States, working with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent and working with those who are providing support to the UN, is to find a way to reduce and stop the violence and the killing. We have to do everything we possibly can to find ways to promote this political transition and we have to be ready for the post-conflict moment, for the period of transition towards what we want to see, which is democracy. Our approach has to change in a sense; we have to make real progress on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I raised all this with the Foreign Ministers at the Gymnich meeting at the weekend. It was clear, of course, that we are absolutely united that Assad has to go and that we need to see this political transition move forward. We agree that, whilst the humanitarian track is an absolute priority and we must consistently urge the regime and the opposition groups to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, we have to continue to work on a number of different tracks: political, diplomatic and support for the opposition groups to come together and plan for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the political and diplomatic track, the EU Ministers reaffirmed their support for Mr Brahimi as the UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative. I have offered him our expertise and our operational assistance in what is an extremely challenging task. He is working with the Security Council, with the neighbouring countries, with the Arab League and with us. I remind honourable Members that our delegation remains open in Damascus and is ready to assist him and his team in any way. I have made that offer very clear to him and he and I will meet for a long discussion when we meet the General Assembly in New York, where we have a meeting arranged and where we will also be meeting the Secretary-General of the Arab League together in order to look at what we can do regionally.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to carry on urging a political solution and we have to devote our efforts to find a way to make contact with those who are striving for a peaceful process and that means continuing our outreach on the ground, which we do through the people we have on the ground and through all the contracts that we have as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to bring the efforts together because without the support for Mr Brahimi, it will be impossible for him to be able to coordinate and find the tangible results. We did everything we could to support Kofi Annan in what he sought to do to try and work to get the Security Council to be able to come together. We need to continue our diplomatic efforts involving all the key partners. I remain in regular touch with Russia, with China, with all the neighbours of Syria, with all the regional organisations I have already described and, of course, with Ban Ki-moon, with whom I talked about this a few days ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will meet again with all of them as well as with Foreign Minister Lavrov and Secretary Clinton in 10 days’ time in New York. It is absolutely going to be the focus of the UN General Assembly, where I hope we will take the opportunity to seriously discuss and make some progress across the United Nations on this. I believe the Security Council has to work tirelessly to find common ground to support Mr Brahimi. It is absolutely essential that he gets that full support and is able to work in Syria and develop the mission.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues that I have already touched upon is the need to make sure that we work to support the opposition parties. I have said that we need to find ways of bringing them together and to help and support them to be able to find a transitional government that is ready to move forward. That means bringing all the efforts that are currently going on to do that together so that there is a common approach and a general move forward in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, we have the humanitarian aid support, which needs to increase, needs to be tangible, needs to reach people and communities. We have the support from Mr Brahimi in the efforts that he is making to try and find a political solution with the support of everyone, so that the United Nations works together to find the common ground to push forward on this and that we work with the opposition groups, both inside and outside, to find the common ground that can bring together the transitional government-in-waiting and push forward in support of the people.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have facilitated a dialogue with the opposition groups and we ask them again to set aside their differences and agree on this shared platform of principles, particularly where we can see that they can work together in support of the people of Syria and, of course, building on our approach on human rights to ensure that all are included regardless of faith, gender and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to keep up the economic pressure as well. We have had 17 rounds of sanctions. We discussed at the weekend the need to see what more we can do and, as we do in all our sanctions, to make sure that they are being as effective as possible. We will move without further delay; the work has already started to see what more now could be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members will be aware, accountability for the crimes that have taken place requires our full attention. These atrocities cannot go unpunished and we have been prominent in calling for a strong response to the systematic and widespread violations of human rights, to combat impunity and hold accountable those responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Syria. Through the current human rights council session, we will push this forward. We have proposed to provide support to enhance that accountability, the efforts of the independent commission of inquiry, which we want to see extended, and other UN bodies and mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is, of course, incredibly difficult to predict the end of this crisis. We have started the planning for the transition, preparing the set of actions at EU level in which we can add value from day one and to coordinate that with our Member States and international organisations. That means ensuring that we have the capacity to increase our presence inside Syria as soon as the situation allows. It means leading on and working towards effective donor coordination and starting to prepare for a very rapid post-conflict needs assessment. All these things need to be done as well and are being done now. It means setting aside the funds that we are going to need to be able to do this because, as well as the additional support for humanitarian aid, we have to find the resources to be able to support the people and to support the transition that is going to be moving forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">All I can say to end is that we have to begin with the principles that we hold dear, that the future of Syria belongs to the Syrian people, and we have to help them in every possible way that we can. We have engaged in every aspect of trying to find solutions – diplomatic, political – working with Member States to ensure that we are absolutely determined in supporting the efforts of the Security Council, the efforts to bring a common position that will enable the United Nations to move forward and efforts to see what can be done to support the countries of the region, which are, as we speak, dealing with the impact in every possible way and, in doing so, to be able to put the resources behind the words and actually try and help find a solution for the people of Syria.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous debate, Baroness Ashton said that you were appalled by the situation in Syria, and I think we have run out of words to describe it, as has been said in other debates. Indignation, frustration, impotence, and meanwhile, the bloodbath continues in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should look at events, too: Kofi Annan’s resignation in a plan that was doomed to failure from the very beginning. And statements, so many statements: a statement by the new Special Envoy, saying that this is an almost impossible mission, which makes me wonder why he accepted it; a statement by the minister of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, saying that new sanctions are to be imposed on Syria; statements by the Swedish minister, saying that he does not believe sanctions are going to have any impact; statements by the French minister, saying that we need to put more pressure on Syria. In short, a lot of words and not much action.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you rightly said, Baroness Ashton, the situation is continuing as it has done for months, but with even more deaths. The regime is sheltering behind the complicity of Russia and China in the United Nations Security Council, and the opposition is winning support across the regional sphere, hoping that sooner or later, there will be international intervention.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the meantime, Baroness Ashton, I believe the time has come for the EU and regional actors to make a decision. I would like to ask you to answer some specific questions. Do you agree with the statement made by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, who said the time has come to do something if the Security Council does not make any progress? Do you believe it is viable to establish humanitarian corridors? Do you think it is possible to establish a no-fly zone? Do you believe it is desirable and advisable to arm, support and help the opposition?</p>
      <p sl="es">Baroness Ashton, more than 20 000 dead people are looking to us, and we have to turn our words into actions. You have done a very good job of providing humanitarian aid, and continue to do so, but our purpose is not to be an International Red Cross. We want to have political leverage, with other actors, in order to stop this carnage.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I think that we probably all have the same questions, that is to say, you are in front of parliamentarians who firmly believe that the solution is a political solution, without which the problems could spread throughout the region and destabilise it. We can see it today: if there is no political decision, the region will become unstable. We are starting to see it in Lebanon. We can imagine what would happen if there were such a response from Iran. We feel very strongly that we have come to the point where a choice has to be made. I am not asking you to respond but, for us, there is no doubt that it is the major issue today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We went to Washington on Friday: I visited the State Department and everyone talked to me about the next steps. They are looking at the transition for ‘the day after’. Are we already there? I thought that we were still in the thick of it. I see that there are plans for the future. We know how to neutralise chemical weapons, we know how to provide humanitarian aid, and so on, and we are all preparing for after the transition because that is an area where our hands are free. However, it is surreal, in my opinion, to be talking about the post-transition period when people are dying today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am not asking you for a response that you cannot give, but I would perhaps ask you one last thing, Baroness Ashton. I am obsessed about the risk of this spreading and I know that you are working to reduce this risk, but we need to put more emphasis on that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have talked about your conversations and your dialogue with Iran. I know that you put a lot of emphasis on the Lebanese issue, but perhaps reducing the risk of this spreading would already be a very concrete response to what we are terribly concerned about today and what is, in fact, discouraging us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to say to Ms Ashton that I think her approach is completely unrealistic: to talk here in the plenary about political transition at a time when there are 25 000 deaths and 70 000 people missing in Syria and 250 000 refugees outside Syria.</p>
      <p sl="de">No, let us recognise that it is the attitude of the international community – which is doing nothing at all – that is a scandal. We know why they are doing nothing: because there are American elections. It is impossible at the moment for the candidate who will be elected – or for the candidate who will be re-elected – to have an operation in Syria. That is the reality.</p>
      <p sl="de">So tell us the truth and do not tell us we are waiting for a political transition. There will not be a political transition unless, first of all, the problem of the violence of Assad is tackled and an end put to his regime. You know it very well: end the Assad regime. It will only be done by the international community taking a number of measures – a no-fly zone, for example. If you do not start with a no-fly zone, he can continue to use his planes against the population, against Aleppo, against other cities in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you do not create safe zones near the borders with Jordan and Turkey, it is impossible to have a safe haven for refugees. If you do not create humanitarian corridors so that the people can go there, the problems will continue. If you do not give weapons to the Free Syrian Army, then it will be the Jihad that continues to enter. This is what I hear: ‘Syria is a problem. The Jihad fighters are there now’.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is our responsibility. If the western democracies do not shoulder their responsibilities – which we are not doing now – then automatically it is warriors of the Jihad who will be carrying out violence inside Syria, as is happening at the moment. So my question to you is: Will you simply continue this? Keep repeating this message? Then there will be 30 000 deaths, maybe 40 000 deaths in the future, half a million refugees. It is time that the international community recognises that neither the Kofi Annan plan, nor its successor, are able to do it.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is time also to overcome the deadlock in the Security Council. I think that we have an obligation to protect these people and this obligation to protect these people is not, in my opinion, a value that is dependent on the attitude of the Russians and the attitude of the Chinese.</p>
      <p sl="de">A coalition of the willing was possible for bad causes – we did it in the past. Why not for a good cause here in Syria to end the bloodshed that is happening today? That is your task: to lead us. If the Americans do not have the courage, maybe you have and the Europeans have the courage.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card question. – Do you really believe, Mr Verhofstadt, that it is simply a question of the US election, when, at the Democratic Convention, President Obama just boasted, and rightly so, about ending two wars? Do you think that if he is elected, he is going to start another war that could be even more dangerous than the Iraq war or the Afghanistan war? If, as you suggest, we end the deadlock in the Security Council, which would obviously be ‘the’ solution, that would mean that Russia is in agreement to some extent. If Russia is in agreement, however, that would mean that Bashar would be gone straight away, and there would be no need for war.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer. – If the Americans or the Europeans do not have the courage to intervene, it is going to continue; that we know. Assad is not going to leave of his own volition. As we know, all of the sanctions have already been applied. Increasing the number of sanctions will change nothing at all. The only thing that can change anything is for the Americans and the Europeans to establish a no-fly zone in Syria, as they have done in the past. This would automatically lead to the liberation of territories, which, for some, are already liberated. At the moment, however, there is a civil war over there. I hear people saying: ‘Yes but, you know, your attitude is very dangerous; that could start a war’. There is already a war in Syria, however. There is a civil war in which many tens of thousands of people have died.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should be asking ourselves the following question instead: for how long are we going to allow this situation to continue? If we had intervened six or nine months ago, 10 000 or 15 000 fewer people would have died.</p>

He speaks here of war and civil war, and I would like to ask him to what extent he knows which forces are actually fighting against the regime in Syria, and whether or not there is a danger that the situation will be abused by Islamist and totalitarian forces, particularly with regard to minorities in Syria, Christians in Syria and other groups.

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – In my opinion, the extremists are coming in more and more at this moment because the western democracies are not taking on their responsibilities. The only help that the Syrian people are receiving for the moment is from extremists coming in who have weapons, while the Free Syrian Army has no weapons and no possibility to fight against Assad’s army. I think that is the reason why we are partly responsible for the fact that more and more Jihad warriors are entering Syria, coming from Jordan and other neighbouring countries into Syria. The only way to stop that is for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities. It should decide on a free no-fly zone and on the other elements that I have listed. Otherwise, we are responsible for the radicalisation of the conflict.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are, once again, in one of those debates typical of this Parliament: a debate about a real dilemma. The situation in Syria is complex. The situation in Syria is problematic. We do not know whether to intervene or not. It is, in fact, very easy to know what to do, so let us start with the simple things.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is simple that 200 000 refugees have left Syria. We have the tools to handle this; it is not true to say that we do not. The European Refugee Fund has not been completely spent: we have millions of euro for resettling the refugees in those camps and for improving conditions in the camps. Moreover, we have the refugees who are inside Syria itself, who are the result of the EU’s past blunders because there are still hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Iraq War in the town of Jaramana, near Damascus, mainly from minorities: Christians, Sabaeans, Mandeans, Yazidi and Zoroastrians. They are 70 kilometres from the Lebanese border and a humanitarian corridor could be opened. However, there are 200 … 200 Palestinian refugees in the camp of Al Hol, whom we have promised to resettle; they are 10 kilometres from the border. We could also establish a humanitarian corridor 10 kilometres from the Iraqi border or 30 kilometres from the Turkish border.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, what I should like to say to Lady Ashton, above all, is that we do not need a humanitarian corridor because the EU has a border with Syria. An EU Member State – which currently holds the Presidency of the Council – has a maritime border. Lady Ashton only has to talk to the Cypriot Presidency and say that, instead of Cyprus allowing arms through to al-Assad, as it has already done, what it must do is open its maritime border to receive refugees there and then, using a European distribution key, as has already been suggested here, distribute these refugees around the EU, and prepare them and help them, so that we can support democratic transition in Syria. All she has to do is talk to the Cypriot Presidency, which has not been doing anything.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, at the end of last week, Jacques Beres, co-founder of Médecins Sans Frontières , returned to Paris after a fortnight of providing intensive medical treatment in a hospital in Aleppo, which is on the front line.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In a candid interview, he said he had predominantly treated rebel fighters, of whom at least half were of foreign origin. Among Mr Beres’ patients, there were dozens of fanatical jihadists – as we have already heard during this debate – including young French citizens.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, these four walls have already witnessed heated debates on other occasions in favour of the war, in favour of military intervention, allegedly as a means of resolving conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="es">Iraq and Afghanistan, for example. In no way whatsoever do I share people’s need to turn Syria into another Iraq or Afghanistan, where insecurity has increased, where death and destruction have been caused, and the Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan. Yes, the Taliban. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, al-Qaeda was not responsible, and yet intervention took place. All to create a more unjust world.</p>
      <p sl="es">In Syria, we have to condemn Mr Assad’s crimes and repression, but also those of the opposition, as well as the opposition’s terrorist acts, jihad and links with al-Qaeda. The only possible solution is peace. Therefore, we should support the United Nations special envoy and make all the states in the region, including Iran, commit to a ceasefire so that the Syrian people can decide their own future, but not in order to establish a government of one colour or another according to whatever most suits each particular state, as the United States and Saudi Arabia do. Absolutely not. We should do so in order for the Syrian people to be free to decide their own future, and to put an end to this horrendous civil war.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is no time to be adding fuel to the fire, Mr Verhofstadt. That is not the point, and we should not push for a foreign military intervention that will lead to chaos in the region – nothing but chaos.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to begin by condemning the repression of the opposition using extreme violence and the deliberate attacks perpetrated against civilians by the Assad regime and its supporters. These acts of violence have also affected the Romanian community in Syria which was formed at the start of the crisis, numbering roughly 14 000. Many Romanian citizens have chosen not to leave Syria and are therefore suffering from the barbarity of the Syrian regime.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Apart from providing humanitarian aid to victims, our main concern must remain, in my view, diplomatic action, aimed at persuading Bashar al-Assad to withdraw from Syrian politics in order to allow a cessation to the clashes to be negotiated. In this regard, I welcome the decision made by the Foreign Affairs Council to impose even harsher sanctions against the Syrian regime. I believe that every possible measure needs to be devised and applied to contain the actions of the dictator in Damascus, for example, restricting Syria’s financial and commercial activities, as was also decided in the case of Iran.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I am deeply concerned about the current deadlock in the UN Security Council and am appalled that some permanent members are tolerating the massacre in Syria in order to protect their commercial interests in the region. In the wake of the renewed refusal by Russia and China to negotiate a new resolution on the Syrian problem, I think that the European Union should join forces with its strategic partners to support a united Syrian opposition.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I share the feelings of frustration and shame for the inaction of the international community in exercising its responsibility to protect the people of Syria, towards whom I feel a great solidarity. However, I understand that this is one area where the High Representative cannot move along if our Member States are not moving along. The equipment which is necessary to implement a no-fly zone cannot be made by simple statements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I support working with Brahimi, with the OIC and with the Arab League now to try to find a solution. I am also in favour of supporting and encouraging the opposition to get together so that they will be able to deal with the situation after Assad. It is, of course, crucial that Assad and his henchmen and women are brought in front of the ICC – out of Syria and in front of the ICC. Of course, humanitarian support is crucial, but that alone is not enough. We need to send a very clear message to Russia, China, Brazil, India, and so on – and to their public opinion – that it is outrageous the way their countries are behaving, obstructing the work of the Security Council and preventing the international community from exercising its responsibility to protect the people of Syria.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, after so many debates on Syria, I already know what we are going to be hearing from you: it is a terrible tragedy; human rights have to be respected; Assad has lost his legitimacy; the EU has imposed sanctions and provided humanitarian aid in cooperation with our partners, etc. etc. But this means nothing any more for the Syrian people who are being slaughtered every day, caught between a murderous regime and foreign fighters ranging from Hizbollah to al-Qaeda.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think Assad is losing sleep over EU sanctions. The options are not easy, but doing nothing is no longer one of them. Let us at least enforce our own embargoes effectively. You will understand the shock I experienced at reading the Council conclusions on 23 July, one year and two months after EU sanctions and an arms embargo were imposed. I quote: ‘EU countries will be obliged to inspect vessels and aircraft heading to Syria if they suspect they contain weapons or equipment for internal repression’. Is this what we are coming up with as a result of a Council, one year and two months after the imposition of an EU arms embargo? I do not think this does any justice to the EU as a global player. Words are no longer enough for the Syrian people.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Blue-card question. – Ms Schaake, I agree with most of your speech, but I should like to ask you a question, partly because I do not believe Lady Ashton had the opportunity to hear me a moment ago. You are, I suppose, aware that the main suspect in transporting arms – in particular, Russian arms – to al-Assad is an EU government, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council? It is the government of Cyprus which, moreover, has a maritime border with Syria. The fact is that we do not need humanitarian corridors on land if we share a maritime border with Syria which could, instead of allowing arms into Syria, be used to resettle refugees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Indeed, the role of Cyprus is very important here. There have been ships which have docked in Cyprus that have later continued on with weapons on board to Syria. That is a disgrace. I am surprised, and confused, about what a weapons embargo even means if this can continue to happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we are not capable of at least enforcing our own actions and words, such as on a weapons embargo and the export of repressive technologies, then we are losing our credibility.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it is obvious that we all accept one thing: the actions of the al-Assad regime are indefensible, in Syria or any other part of the world; the way in which it has used military force on the population is absolutely indefensible.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What I cannot understand from a number of speeches here is that people are saying we need more robust foreign military intervention. Let us agree on one thing: foreign military intervention has been going on in Syria for a long time. In fact, what is happening is that we are all jointly responsible for this situation, since we are exacerbating a domestic conflict between Sunni and Shia. The solution for Syria is a political solution: there can be no other. In this regard, I completely support what the High Representative said.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot say that there are good wars and bad wars. All wars are bad. All the parties involved in this process want to win, but – please consider – the losers here are Syria’s civilian population. It is they who are losing. We will therefore attempt to reach a solution by means of politics and of supporting that which can be supported, not with an intervention that will not be any kind of miracle cure for a region that is – let us agree – in the midst of the most problematic situation currently being experienced in the Middle East.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we continue to stand by powerlessly as a people is massacred by murderers in the pay of a regime that is cornered, has no future, and insists on keeping a grip on power at the expense of the blood of its own citizens. This situation is untenable and intolerable. Legally and institutionally, al-Assad is responsible, but is that really the case? In the end, who is in charge in Syria? Is it him or is it his father’s entourage? Is he here lying to his people too?</p>
      <p sl="pt">To make the situation even more tragic, the strange patchwork comprising the opposition does not suggest that the al-Assad era will be followed by a solution that is simultaneously democratic, tolerant and representative of Syria’s various religious, ethnic, social and cultural realities. A solution will also be impossible without a vehement repudiation of some of the forms of struggle used by the opposition in this fratricidal and irrational war that brings into conflict dark forms of idealism mixed with genuine cries for freedom from a regime fighting solely for its survival. They should also know that war crimes will not be tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Once again, High Representative, the EU is demonstrating its sensitivity to the tragedy of the more than 250 000 refugees in neighbouring countries, as the largest donor of humanitarian aid. I hope it is being correctly channelled. I should like to get something off my chest, however: the international community has been acting so hypocritically that it is just discrediting itself. I am one of those who refuse to accept that a Syrian life is not worth the same as any other life.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, every month, we come together here in order to condemn repeatedly the horrific violence in Syria and, every time, our words prove inadequate. A regime that sacrifices its own population in such a way will be overthrown, that is for sure. We also need to repeat that message to the supporters of President Assad – those who still have doubts. Our message has to be: there is no future with him and his regime. Change your allegiance and join us in building a new Syria.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We need to make much more effort than we are currently making to take action that will lead to the further crumbling of the regime and its isolation. Of course, arms deliveries must be discontinued. A military intervention might sound enticing, but I agree with those who say that that could cause even more chaos. We could only consider such a course of action if a unanimous Syrian opposition make a demand to that effect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the meantime, we have to provide effective humanitarian aid, increase pressure on China and Russia in every possible way to turn their backs on the regime and to do everything possible to help the opposition organise, unite and develop a credible alternative.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, various scenarios can certainly be proposed for a solution to the crisis, but none of them would be easy, because the international community is so divided on this issue. We had an example of this recently, when on Sunday, Hillary Clinton dismissed Russia’s proposal for a UN resolution, calling it pointless and ‘without teeth’. Russia, on the other hand, still disagrees with the West’s call for al-Assad to relinquish power, and it also opposes additional sanctions against Syria, and Iran too.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Here, many of the Members have stated that extremist movements, jihadists, have become entangled in this war, and it is also possible that this crisis will spread very quickly to neighbouring countries.

The country is still drowning in blood and the West is standing by helpless. Our inability and the inability of the Security Council to send a strict message is allowing Assad to believe that he can still win. That is our failure. Neighbouring countries, specifically Lebanon and Jordan and, primarily, Turkey, are under huge pressure from the massive influx of refugees. According to UN data, one hundred thousand Syrians abandoned their country in August alone, in quest of refuge in neighbouring Turkey. Turkey objectively cannot handle such numbers alone. The search for security and survival will bring these people to European host countries, such as Greece, Italy and, ultimately, the other EU Member States. The consequences of this exodus will be huge. Even at this eleventh hour, we must join forces and find a way of putting an immediate end to the violence and strengthening humanitarian efforts, in order to give some prospects and some hope to these people.</p>

In my opinion, the priority should be for the dictator Assad to go. The dead will not come back and certainly do not need our help. Of course, humanitarian aid still needs to be sent at the same time and in parallel. I should like to put a question to Lady Ashton: is there any removal plan and, if so, what is it?

      <p sl="de">The Assad regime’s willingness to cling on to power using all available means was universally underestimated. This brutality could be linked to the multi-religious tensions which have been simmering in the region for a long time and which are known to be exacerbated by ethnic conflicts. Nothing else remains to be done save exerting more pressure on the regime by imposing sanctions. Direct military intervention, however, should probably be ruled out. The divided opposition and the fact that the rebels do not shy away from committing human rights violations, arbitrary executions and torture either are reason enough not to do this.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me begin by making something very clear. We are not doing nothing. I think sometimes some honourable Members have the mistaken idea that if you have a military activity, that is action, and that somehow diplomatic activity is not. On behalf of the tireless work that our delegation does every day in Damascus in Syria, and in the United Nations and elsewhere, I must ask them to remember the efforts they make.</p>
      <p sl="en">I paid tribute to our Head of Delegation for Syria at the Heads of Delegation Conference because I know how much he does and the challenges and risks he has to take. It would be wrong of this House not to recognise those activities. We are not doing nothing. There is a huge amount going on. What I tried to point out were the areas of activity where we have been able to show real progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members will appreciate that we have looked at every single idea that they have put forward – and many others. There are people in Brussels and across the European Union – military experts and others – who look at every possible way in which we could engage with Syria. They also look at the way in which we have engaged historically and they look at the political needs that we have in so doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Syria is not Libya and you should not mix them up. They are completely different in every possible way and we have to recognise that. A Security Council resolution led the way in Libya. We knew that a no-fly zone was a military action. It is not a benign activity. It is something you do using military assets. If you move in and decide you are going to take military action, you have to recognise the size and scale of what is being asked and ask how to do that, what one can be sure about when one goes in and how many countries are willing to put young men and women on the line to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe a political solution is what we have to work towards. The situation on the ground is very difficult. Yes, there are Jihad fighters. Yes, there are people from different groups on the ground. No, it is not our fault that they are there, but yes, it is true. The situation has become more difficult and more confused, and because we cannot get the Opposition groups to come together with a coherent and comprehensive view of what the transition would be in support of all the people, it is even more difficult to establish a way in which we can do this, but we have to keep trying and we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every single day we work on these issues, every single day we work with the neighbouring countries. Every single day we work with the Security Council members. Every day we work with our delegation on the ground, with the international NGOs and with the Red Cross and others. Do not accuse us of inactivity please.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of what I think you want to see happen, I understand your frustrations. I really do. I understand the passion. I share it. It is a horrendous situation, but we have to be careful and clear about what we can do to engage with it. When I met with the 27 Foreign Ministers, that is what we talked about. We talked about all the possibilities. We talked about what we felt we could do and we came to the conclusions that you have seen in the Council conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just add, by the way, the reason for the Council conclusion on getting Member States to check what is going through their countries is precisely because this Parliament asked us to. That is why we did it. Now I find, perhaps, that that has not been accepted for what it was. But it was you who asked us, and I did it, and that is why it matters that we continue to insist that Member States ensure that what is going through their ports is checked whenever they have reason to believe it is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also why we continue to look for more sanctions that we can place on the regime, not least to send the strongest and clearest message to everyone else that we want to see Assad go and we want to see a solution inclusive of the people of Syria, and born of the people of Syria, that will help them get the kind of society that we think most people want, because the truth is most people in Syria want Assad to go and want a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what we have to build on and that is what we have to support, and to do it in a way that we believe can be effective. We have worked really hard with the Security Council Members. I spent eleven hours in Geneva talking with members of the Security Council and others to try and get the Geneva discussion to bring in everyone. I work hard in the core group of the Friends of Syria. We attend and discuss many meetings all the time to try and find a way through this. We are not inactive. The European Union is respected for what we try to do in supporting the people of Syria and trying to find a way through this incredibly difficult challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">Frankly, honourable Members, if it was easy to find a solution to this, we would have done so already. It is not hiding under a cushion somewhere; it is amazingly difficult. People across the world are trying to engage and find that solution. So, before we leap to the conclusion that unless you have military activity you are inactive, let us really consider what we mean by that. Let us really consider the implications of the big words translated into action on the ground and start thinking properly and comprehensively about what we do, including in the days after.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because if we do not start preparing for that now – and the State Department are right to prepare for it – we will not be ready for what could be a situation which crumbles very quickly and where we will have to be ready with assets to move in, to support people in all the places we have been unable to reach. To get the infrastructure working and to get people into a future is going to need an enormous amount of effort. If we do not get the planning done for that now, we will not be in a position to help people. So I encourage you to support the US and us and everybody else in doing so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I hope I have given you a sense of the passion I feel about this issue. I take my responsibilities seriously, but we have to find solutions which we know are going to work, that we can engage with members of the international community to achieve and, most of all, that we believe will bring peace as quickly as possible and not an escalation of violence.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We have been counting the death toll from the domestic conflict seriously afflicting the Syrian people for 18 months. Diplomatic efforts, political pressure and international sanctions have not produced any result. In addition, August was the bloodiest month since the outbreak of the revolt in March 2011. The deterioration in the situation in Syria complicates the regional balance. The attacks on the Kurdish rebels along the Turkish-Syrian border are threatening to globalise the conflict in a Middle East which is overshadowed by war and at a time of growing tension between Iran and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Against the backdrop of the continuing deadlock in the Security Council on Syria, the new UN envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, replacing Kofi Annan who has stepped down, feels that military intervention would signify the failure of the political process. In these circumstances, I would like to know what the European Union’s position is on the Egyptian President’s initiative to call a meeting of the representatives of a group of states in the region with the aim of finding solutions to the Syrian crisis. I believe that regional dialogue may be more effective than other options, some of which have already been used up, but only if there is also the necessary desire to find a solution on the part of the major powers whose lack of support has been criticised by the previous UN mediator, Kofi Annan.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Some months ago, I asked the High Representative about her views on the possibility of changing the positions of Russia and China regarding intervention in Syria. We cannot just watch President Assad killing his opponents and not do anything. Over 20 000 people have now died in this conflict. The lack of any effective involvement by Western democratic countries has also permitted extremist groupings to become stronger. We should do everything we can to convince China and Russia to stop blocking UN Security Council decisions. Every day that this decision is postponed condemns Syria to move ever further from introducing peace, stability, development, respect for law and respect for human rights. We are condemning the whole country to slow annihilation.</p>

      <p sl="it">I add my voice to that of my fellow Members who have signed the joint resolution on Syria, in calling on the international community to intervene to try and stop the massacre that we can see from the media is taking place on a daily basis. Since the unrest first began in March 2011, almost 20 000 people have died, many of whom were defenceless women and children targeted in attacks organised by the men of President Assad’s regime. The number of refugees is even higher. Hundreds of people are continuing to flow into neighbouring countries, creating instability in areas of the world which are already very politically unstable. In addition, in Syria, around 3 million people need urgent aid, because the Syrian Government has cut their access to food, water and medicines. I am sorry to have to acknowledge that so far, the United Nations has been unable to satisfactorily manage the situation, which seems to be getting more and more out of hand every day, leading to the resignation of Kofi Annan. The Syrian regime has at this point lost all credibility and legitimacy in its role as representative of the Syrian people, and it is to be hoped that President Assad will step down.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with the President of the ALDE Group, Guy Verhofstadt, that the prolonged hesitation of the international community to take action is scandalous. It has already cost the lives of far too many Syrian people and unless the violence is brought to an end, the death toll may exceed that in Libya. It is just tragic that the blocking members of the UN Security Council will have the blood of many Syrians on their hands now as well. Yet the reluctance of the Member States to make further efforts to end the conflict in the immediate neighbourhood is also difficult to understand, since tensions in this region bear direct consequences for the European Union. The Middle East is a powder keg that will do much better without the naked flame in Syria. I encourage the High Representative to call on the Member States to support and provide means for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria and taking further measures to end the massacre in the country.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Last week, the Commission announced an increase in European humanitarian aid to Syria. Between the contributions from the Member States and the sums allocated from the EU budget, almost EUR 200 million have been released. I wish to congratulate the EU on its financial efforts and underline the difficulties encountered on the ground in getting the aid to its destination. We urgently need ‘humanitarian pauses’ to help the 2.5 million Syrians who have been displaced and/or trapped in urban confrontations (mainly in Damascus and Aleppo). The ‘regional protection programme’ soon to be launched by the EU must receive the unanimous support of the international community. The complicit diplomacy of Russia, China and other emerging countries towards the al-Assad regime is intolerable: in the face of a civil war that is growing worse by the day, it is essential to establish a responsible international scenario that results in effective action. The repercussions of that action on neighbouring countries, notably Lebanon and Jordan, must be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We are in a typical trap: on the one hand, we want to do all we can to stop the war in Syria. Humanitarian reasons lead us there. The only possible way is intervention. Nevertheless, on the other hand, we want to respect international law, and that means acting under a UN mandate. We do not have one, however – Russia and China are blocking it. How to proceed: bypass the UN and intervene on the principle of a ‘coalition of the willing’? We must decide whether to leave Syria to its own devices or to intervene, even with the consequences for the global legal system and the position of the UN. If we decide against intervention, we shall have to bear the moral responsibility. If we do intervene, we will have to bear the consequences of a military operation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, during the last exchange we had in this House in February on the conduct of the Duma and presidential elections in Russia, we shared our concerns about the irregularities and violations of the electoral process and about the violence against demonstrators and their detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we welcomed the political awakening of Russian civil society. We saw Russian civil society ready to engage in dialogue with the government and to play an active role in the development of political institutions in the country. We saw some signs of cautious but real dialogue between government and citizens emerging.</p>
      <p sl="en">We had been encouraging the then newly-elected President Putin to pursue the political and economic reforms that were started by President Medvedev. We also offered our support in working on our shared modernisation agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been some important developments in that respect. First and foremost, let me mention Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation on 22 August. By joining the WTO, Russia took a major step forward in its ongoing integration into the international rules-based trade system. We strongly supported that process and now expect Russia to fully implement all the related agreements, so as to reap the maximum benefit of membership of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">There had been some encouraging initial steps in the spring towards further development of Russia’s democratic institutions, notably the easing of party registration rules and requirements for presidential candidates, as well as direct elections of regional governors. However, these have been the only positive political reforms this year so far. To allow for a truly pluralistic parliamentary system, without undue obstacles to the work of a viable opposition, much more needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Upon President Putin’s return to the Kremlin, we encouraged him to engage in a constructive dialogue with citizens and civil society to find the best way forward and ensure a good future for Russia. Since May, however, we have been seeing less and less dialogue and openness on the side of the authorities, and rather more intolerance of any expression of dissenting views. Instead of stronger safeguards for the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, we have seen a string of measures that chip away at them.</p>
      <p sl="en">At least four major pieces of new legislation went through the Duma at unusual – some would say unconstitutional – speed, before the summer recess. Their common aim seems to have been to further reduce the available space for independent civil and political activity in the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Immediately after the inauguration of the new President on 7 May, a number of opposition leaders and activists who organised and participated in the 6 May demonstrations were arrested and fined. Many face serious criminal charges. Soon after, on 8 June, President Putin signed into law restrictive amendments effectively limiting the scope for demonstrations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I reacted to these developments with a public statement. I stressed that the government should, including via legislation, guarantee freedom of assembly for citizens. I also cautioned that strong measures to curtail this right were likely to prove counterproductive.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few weeks later, another law was passed forcing Russian NGOs receiving foreign funding to present themselves as ‘foreign agents’ in all their activities. Given the history of such a term, foreign funding is thus considered by law to turn its recipients into ‘spies’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I reiterated my serious concerns over these developments as well as the overall worsening situation for civil society in Russia. Grassroots civil society movements, be it human rights NGOs or election monitoring organisations such as Golos, are important components of democratic society. They do an essential job in Russia today and they are key to Russia’s modernisation. In the interests of Russia, they should be allowed to work freely and have the means to do it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have supported some NGOs in their activities and will continue to offer our support to their contribution to the modernisation of Russia. We do so because the European Union has a strong interest in a stable, prosperous and democratic Russia. We have been offering our support to those in Russia who share this goal. But by doing it, we neither impose our objectives on these Russian organisations, nor do we aim in any way to control their activities. In no way do these Russian organisations become our, or anybody else’s, agents; let me state this very clearly. All Russian NGOs I know would undoubtedly prefer to receive Russian funding, but there is barely any public funding available for activities that could potentially be perceived as being critical of the authorities, nor do many businessmen dare to offer support.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not go into the details now of the laws on libel and Internet freedom. The key issue is how they will be interpreted and applied. We will pay attention to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members know, most recently, on 17 August, three young women, members of the punk band ‘Pussy Riot’, were sentenced to two years in prison each for a peaceful, less-than-one-minute long performance. We all understand that this provocative stunt in the Christ-the-Saviour cathedral hurt religious feelings. But it was a non-violent expression of political opinion. Under Russian law, it should have been sanctioned as a minor offence, not as a serious crime. On the same day, I issued a statement to express my deep disappointment with the disproportionate sentence and recalled Russia’s commitments to respect its obligations to ensure fair, transparent and independent legal process. Serious irregularities in the trial have been reported, including the conditions of pre-trial detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taken together, the package of legislation limiting the freedom of assembly, restricting NGOs, curtailing the freedom of the Internet, the Pussy Riot case, an upsurge in prosecution of activists, including Alexey Navalny, and the sentencing of Ms Osipova, the dismissal of an opposition-minded Duma deputy and a continued lack of progress on the Magnitsky case, constitute a trend of great concern to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">This trend raises serious questions on the state of the rule of law and, in particular, the use of legal and law enforcement structures and other instruments for political purposes, which should be used to safeguard and protect the rights and freedoms of the citizens of Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to stress again the importance of having an economically successful, modern, and democratic Russia at the border of the European Union. Russia is sometimes a challenging neighbour, but it remains an important partner of the European Union on many issues and in many fields.</p>
      <p sl="en">We remain ready to work with Russia in all the positive reform efforts, to work closely together on the Partnership for Modernisation, the integration of the international rules-based system, and the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms: that has to be the basis for stability and prosperity. We will continue to work closely with the government and ministries on these goals but we should not shy away from our responsibilities as a partner to express our concerns with recent developments. We worry that the government sets the country on the wrong path and wastes an opportunity for effective modernisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the European Parliament for working continuously and consistently with me and the EEAS services on both these strands. Let me take my opportunity to express my gratitude to Parliament, in particular, for your strong support for civil society cooperation between the EU and Russia, including, of course, in financial terms.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I agree with every word you said. They are also reflected in the resolution we negotiated today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are both incredibly critical about Russia’s democratic development. We also know that that country has never had a real democracy and that this is a learning process which Russia needs to go through. However, whilst at one point, with the inauguration of President Medvedev, we thought we would be able to cherish hope and confidence that the situation would take a turn for the better, it is now actually heading in the opposite direction. We agree with you that Russia’s modernisation means that it will become more prosperous and that that will lead, in particular, to a democratisation of Russian society.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is not just we Europeans who recognise that things are not going well, that the situation is stagnating; the Russians see it too. Ten days ago, an EU delegation visited Russia and we spoke in St Petersburg about civil society. We also discussed there all the laws that you have just mentioned. The problem is that we never know where we stand with Russia’s vague and very broad interpretation of civil society. As a result of this, an orderly functioning of civil society is absolutely impossible, as organisations no longer know over which point they could be taken to trial.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What are we going to do together to ensure that Russia abides by the rule of law? That is the only way to modernise.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, dear colleagues, let me just say, on behalf of the Socialists and Democrats, that we, too, are interested in an economically viable, socially responsible and strong Russia – a Russia that is based on the principles of human rights, civil rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was recognised 25 years ago by Mikhail Gorbachev when he talked about the human factor. He knew, and the reformers knew, that they could only move Russia forward if they mobilised the free will of the people. This will of the people, this energy of the Russian people, has to be based on the observation of human rights, civil rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, in this regard, we are also very distressed with the situation that has been developing since May, not only with the harsh sentencing of the rock band ‘Pussy Riot’, but also with cases such as moves to strip a freely-elected deputy, Gennady Gudkov, of his mandate. The same applies to Mr Ponomarev.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, the Socialists and Democrats, want dialogue with Russia. We are willing to talk to our Russian partners. Russia is also a member of the OECD and of the Council of Europe. Therefore, I think that it is in Russia’s interest and in our interest to develop a dialogue not only on strategic partnership, economic cooperation and energy, but also on human and civil rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not only in our interest, it is, above all, in Russia’s interest, because without us, the Russian economy, Russian society and the Russian state cannot develop.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Russian civil society knows that it can count on our moral support. That is expressed in the series of resolutions. However, are words enough to protect Russia’s democratic development? The fates of Politkovskaya, Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky demonstrate clearly that the Russian authorities have not kept their promise to implement the rule of law. Now we face a dilemma. Do we continue with the same strategy, increasing the level of verbal pleas? Should our thoughts not be accompanied by concrete gestures? We are deeply moved by the fate of three young political activists of the Pussy Riot group, which represents the desire for political freedom held by the new generation in Russia. The state’s response was a continuation of all of the draconian measures previously taken against any real political activities that the Kremlin did not like.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For Russian civil society, for the new generation of Russians, we need to live the truth. Words are not enough. We need a gesture, an act that proves our commitment to all those who hope for freedom in Russia. A law is needed to encourage the establishment of the rule of law. The ‘Magnitsky law’ is designed to be a carefully targeted reaction against all those who are responsible for human rights abuses and those who are corrupt. It is a gesture of solidarity with Russian civil society. There is no time to lose. We must act now. Support the ‘Magnitsky law’! Support freedom for Russia!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, five months after the forced re-election of President Putin, relations between the EU and Russia have reached a low point. We should finally and honestly take stock of the situation and stop pretending to ourselves. For years we have been making efforts to bring about a strategic partnership, but we do not yet have one. In fact, this goal is still a long way off. Our policy of integration and appeasement has reached its limits. The conflicts in Syria and Iran, which we have just been discussing, demonstrate that we do not have common interests and that we are pursuing diametrically opposed objectives. The despotic and autocratic regimes in Asia are closer to the Kremlin than the liberal West. This is made clear by the ambitious project to set up a Eurasian Union, which lacks a convincing political and economic base. The modernisation agreement has got no further than declarations of intent and the new government has not exactly shown itself to be committed to modernisation. Quite the contrary.</p>
      <p sl="de">The laws recently passed by the Duma, which still has no legitimacy, are taking Russia back into the past. They are tendentious and have deliberately vague wording in order to open the door to arbitrary justice. This is demonstrated by the dreadful trials of Mr Khodorkovsky and Pussy Riot and by the criminal prosecution and appalling death of Sergei Magnitsky. In Russia, the prosecution of crimes depends not on the acts themselves, but on whether the legal proceedings meet the ruling elites’ political requirements or are useful to them. Russia is no longer on the way to becoming a state under the rule of law. Instead, it is moving in the opposite direction. Our one-sided efforts to bring about cooperation and modernisation seem more like attempts to introduce change by ingratiating ourselves with the Russian regime. The Kremlin sees this as an acknowledgement of the political line it is taking. Therefore, we must show that we have the determination to put these questions to the test.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have had the opportunity today to listen to many critical comments here about the behaviour of Russia in the international arena, such as in Syria and Georgia. You are right, Baroness Ashton – this was clear from your speech – that we, too, are to blame and that we have many problems relating to the internal situation in Russia. In addition to all the matters that you raised, to the new issues that you discussed, to the new laws that restrict human rights and freedoms, I would like to add another matter, which you did not mention, namely, the situation of Ms Osipova – I am sure you are aware of her situation – who has been convicted for alleged drug possession. There are also older unresolved matters, such as those of Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky, and there are the new cases which you discussed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have some good news for you: today, we have completed negotiations on the resolution we are discussing. The negotiations finished four hours ago and, to be honest, there were no special discussions as all the political groups were in agreement.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Russian justice system, which should be independent, has become an efficient tool for the authorities to strike at the opposition with drastic sentencing, sending them to isolated Siberian prisons or to fudge inconvenient matters, leaving them unresolved for years. The Russian police and prosecution service still have not been able to find and try the killers of Anna Politkovskaya or Natalia Estemirova, for example. There are very worrying reports about the Russian organisation ‘Golos’, which monitors elections. A court in Moscow imposed a fine of RUB 30 000 on this organisation. Also worrying is the proposal according to which the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation is to gain the right to block implementation of decisions by the European Court of Human Rights. In the light of these events, the fundamental question arises: how has the European External Action Service responded to the abovementioned instances, which are illegal and detrimental for the rule of law? In the context of these events, the conviction of the members of Pussy Riot, whose vulgar performance also offended thousands of Christians around the world, can only be judged from the point of view of severity rather than whether the penalty was justified. One cannot base arguments concerning the failure of the rule of law and the totalitarian nature of the Kremlin regime on this particular judgment.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to mention the following only as an example for comparison and consideration: in the Czech Republic, a Member State of the European Union, an ordinary citizen – a bus driver – was sent to prison for painting antennae on the pre-election portraits of certain politicians as a protest. It is a remarkable fact that the citizen was sentenced by a judge who is the wife of one these ‘prettified’ politicians. I would like to add that the creator of the antennae has reimbursed the alleged material damages of EUR 600.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I repeat, this happened in a Member State of the Union. Similar examples might be found throughout Europe. So when we want to assess fairness in relation to politics elsewhere, we should first take a look at our own back yard.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the accession of Russia to the World Trade Organisation will certainly strengthen economic relations between that country and the West and, in particular, with the European Union. Although it is very important, trade is not everything that we here in Europe, in the European Parliament or, increasingly, Russian inhabitants themselves, expect from Russia. I had an opportunity to meet and talk to them during two visits to St Petersburg while on holiday.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What do we expect from Russo-European relations? We have the right to expect and we do expect Russia to become not just an increasingly liberal economy, but also that it should become more democratic and European and this also applies to civil liberties. Unfortunately, we are sorry to see that recent events do not appear to be following this trend. The situation in Russia is going in the opposite direction, a negative direction. Repressive acts against opposition activists, to name only Mr Navalny and Mr Kasparov, restrictive laws on non-governmental organisations, restrictions on Internet freedom and the disproportionate sentences handed down to the punk singers – these are just the most recent events showing how badly things are going in Russia. In addition, instances such as the strange case against Mr Khodorkovsky call for justice, as does the unexplained death of Mr Magnitsky. It is time for discussion with Russia to be not just about trade but also about respect for human rights and civil liberties. It is time for a Magnitsky list, that is, a visa ban on persons involved in the death of that brave lawyer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight two points. You probably cannot tell this from looking at me, but I am not a fan of punk music. We are now all familiar with one punk group and that is Pussy Riot. I see the situation slightly differently from Baroness Ashton, but the subject of whether this was a civil protest or simply hooliganism which caused deep offence to other people is open to discussion. We can perhaps even discuss what the penalty for this sort of behaviour should be. We all agree that a two-year sentence is far too long. However, what should concern us and, most importantly, what should concern the Russians in their own country is the clear indication that this trial is once again an example of the political system exerting influence on the judicial system. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the NGO act, which, as has already been said, has deliberately vague wording so that it can be interpreted as required. We need to set clear boundaries. The best thing to do would be to put this act where it belongs, in other words, in the rubbish bin. However, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing you cannot say to me, which is that we must now evaluate everything we do together with Russia. I am firmly convinced, and we discussed this 10 days ago with our Russian colleagues in St Petersburg, that the only sensible way forward is to continue to talk to them and to Russian civil society, in order to get things moving. I am not one of those who believe that a discussion of resolutions by less than 3% of the Members of the European Parliament has better prospects for success.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton has said that Russian civil society is waking up. In fact, Russian civil society has been wide awake for a long time. It is the governments of the majority of Member States of the European Union which are asleep. Therefore, I am very grateful to Baroness Ashton for the clear analysis of the situation that she has given us here today. However, we now need to move on from analysis to action.</p>
      <p sl="de">The name Khodorkovsky, just like that of Magnitsky and many others that have been mentioned today, represents a reversal of the ineffectual moves towards the rule of law in Russia. As a devout Christian, I would like to say that I think Pussy Riot are much more Christian than many of the high-level representatives of the church. They have clearly said, and this is the quintessential point of their message, that the patriarch should listen more closely to God than to Putin. We do not need a church by the grace of Putin or an economy, a Duma or the pretence of the rule of law by the grace of Putin. If we continue to pursue an appeasement policy of this kind, and Mr Schulz is absolutely right in this respect, we will have a European Union by the grace of Putin. This is why I would like to make it very clear that we must focus on the rule of law in our discussions with Russia. Mr Fleckenstein is right. We must talk to Russia, but not in the way that he has described here. Instead, we must use the clear language that the European Parliament has always spoken when it comes to human rights. We cannot let the big countries off the hook and only speak out to the small ones.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Mr Posselt, do you also believe that the clear language spoken by this Parliament has not been as successful as we might have hoped and, therefore, that we need both approaches? We need to work together and to develop projects together, but we must also make our opinions clear in the hope that there will be progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second question is this. Would you be of the same opinion, as a devout Catholic, if all of this had happened in the Vatican or in your church in Munich? For you, that would probably have been the equivalent of the collapse of Western civilisation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Firstly, I would like to say that these remarks were perhaps rather inappropriate and in poor taste. On the other hand, it is the case that we are talking about a different political system. I do not understand at all why speakers here are playing down this brave protest, which is a cry of desperation. It really is a call for help. This is made clear by the fact that a prime minister of one Member State, one of our neighbouring countries, held a public keynote speech and openly demonstrated that he is on the same side as Putin. This really calls the credibility of the European Union into question. It is important that the European Parliament is the voice of credibility in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I think that the legal system in Russia has deteriorated considerably and the cases we are talking about here – and not just the case of the three women in the pop group – mirror the actual state of that legal system.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We all know that it will be very hard to change. Nevertheless, we must make it quite clear that what is happening in Russia in the legal field is a disgrace. It is also a personal disgrace for Vladimir Putin. The three women who were sentenced to two years had already spent almost nine months in custody. Let us bear this fact in mind! Nine months in custody for an act that it is very difficult to classify as a criminal act.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If I take this into account and think back to the old days of communism in Czechoslovakia, I do not remember the legal system being so politically abused in communist Czechoslovakia in the eighties. We must develop relations with Russia, but it should be made clear to Putin that this disgrace will remain with him as a person and as a statesman.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Ms Ashton, I have been encouraged by your clear message in this sad situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since Mr Putin started his third presidential term, the human rights situation has deteriorated markedly, and Russia is heading away from the rule of law. Now the question remains: what must be done? Unless we continue to express our disappointment, we do not really help Russian civil society or our friends there, about whom we are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that it is time to set a threshold, with a warning that if Russia continues so blatantly to ignore its own commitments, there can be no further progress in our relations. The first and perfectly justified step is to establish a new EU common list of Russian officials responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, and to deny them entry visas. This could be followed by similar restrictive measures towards other civil servants and politicians responsible for concrete acts of political repression. Only then, I think, will things begin to change. It is up to us to act or just to react.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the jailing of the three young women of Pussy Riot for two years in a prison colony is an absolute scandal. It graphically reveals the repressive nature of the Putin regime, which will brook no opposition, but it also demonstrates the fear that the regime has not only of Pussy Riot, but of the mass demonstrations that have taken place against the election-rigging and also the threat of a Russian winter. That is because all of the promises made to the people of Russia at the time of the collapse of Stalinism have been proven to be false. They were promised economic growth and the benefits of that growth have gone only to the oligarchs while working people suffer. They were promised democracy. They got only rigged elections and an absence of any real democratic rights, the right to freedom of speech, the right to protest.</p>
      <p sl="en">In her closing statement at the trial, one of the members of Pussy Riot, Yekaterina Samutsevich, accurately summed up the situation: ‘Compared to the judicial machine, we are nobodies and we have lost. On the other hand, we have won. The whole world now sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated’. The system cannot conceal the repressive nature of this trial. It is nobodies like them who, with a mass movement in Russia armed with a socialist programme, can overthrow the Putin regime and bring about democratic and socialist change.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all Members of this House who have contributed in this very important debate. I think the views of Members have been coherent and consistent in saying two or three things with which I agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we need to continue, and to step up, our work with civil society in Russia and to be as supportive as possible of all those who seek a democratic future for their country. We also need to be clear of the importance of Russia in terms of how we work with Russia in our activities across the world. I have already pointed to examples of that, but I would again refer to the Iran talks, where Russia is an important and key partner with us in trying to address the nature of the nuclear programme of Iran. I would not wish honourable Members to be under any illusion that Russia plays anything but an incredibly important role in that. So, too, does the Partnership for Modernisation, but we have to do more to push forward on this. It is important. It is an area of work, both in terms of economic life and in terms of political life, where we can do something.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the concerns that have been raised have been well said. The concerns about individuals and about what is happening in terms of the basis of this debate, which is the political use of justice, have been well noted.

      <p sl="fr">In Russian territory, freedom of expression, a treasure that does not tolerate restrictions or rash judgments, far less the imposition of moral or social standards, is disappearing bit by bit. The story of the three members of the punk group comes at just the right time to shake up the constraints of a totally rigid Russian society. The three seeds of rebellion are, above all, three seeds that are putting pressure on Vladimir Putin’s apparatus of power. Activists, resistance fighters, agitators, militants: the photo of these women locked up in a glass cage was beamed around the world, reflecting the rejection of a judicial system that is reminiscent of the dark times of Stalinist trials. At that time, it took a great deal of courage to dare criticise the dictator in the Kremlin. The Russian poet Osip Mandelstam did not lack any such courage when he wrote, in 1934, an epigram against Stalin, a text that resulted in the writer being exiled to Siberia, where he died in 1938. The band members have received two years’ hard labour for having protested against the authorities. We should probably be more vigilant about respect for human rights when signing trade agreements that are binding on Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the regulation on trade measures is a significant piece of legislation aimed at protecting our common fish stocks. Commissioner Damanaki put forward the proposal in a direct response to the overfishing of mackerel by Iceland and the Faroe Islands in the north-east Atlantic.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was then appointed by the committee to oversee the legislation. From the outset, I received the strongest possible support from my colleagues. As a committee, we proposed broad and hard-hitting measures building on the proposal by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The trialogue that followed between Parliament, the Presidency and the Commission was a success, as all sides entered into talks with a spirit of determination to reach a compromise. The compromise proves that codecision between Parliament and the Council in the area of fisheries does work and can result in a better, stronger and more effective legislation. This is a positive sign ahead of the talks on the reform of the common fisheries policy, despite the unacceptable blockage that continues to exist with several long-term management plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreed text will enable the Union to enforce measures against countries or territories that blatantly disregard the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. The agreement includes quantitative restrictions on fish imports from the stock of common interest and associated species into the EU from the country or territory engaged in unsustainable fishing practices. Significantly, the term ‘associated species’ is broadly defined in the regulation to cover a range of species other than mackerel, for example, and it is based on FAO rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Restrictions will apply to the use of EU ports and on the sale of fishing vessels, fishing equipment and the supplies to the country or territory deemed to be overfishing. In addition, EU vessels will be prohibited under this regulation from reflagging their vessels to the country or territory engaged in unsustainable practices. The regulation also foresees that further measures may be applied under the scope of the regulation if the initial measures prove to be ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has now equipped the Commissioner with an effective and a meaningful instrument designed to prevent unsustainable fishing practices. While the regulation may be used against any third countries, the situation in the north-east Atlantic is of immediate concern to all of us. Iceland has unilaterally increased its mackerel catch from 363 tonnes in 2005 to 147 000 tonnes in 2012. The Faroese quota in mackerel has soared from 27 830 tonnes in 2009 to 149 000 tonnes in 2012. I am extremely disappointed by the failure of the coastal states to reach an agreement in London on 3 September and I would appreciate learning from the Commissioner her plans to move the situation forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like, of course subject to time, to take the opportunity to speak briefly on the common market organisation for fisheries and agriculture products and the report by Struan Stevenson, which is an excellent basis for a final agreement with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The committee adopted several important amendments to the Commission proposal, including the principles of minimisation and avoidance in the first instance and the landing of discarded fish. The committee also adopted clear and understandable labelling on fisheries products. Unfortunately, I do not have time to speak on the other reports. Suffice to say that I congratulate the rapporteurs for their excellent work.</p>

    <intervention id="2-644-000" speaker_id="114268" name="Nils TORVALDS" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Finland" birth_date="07-08-1945" birth_place="Ekenäs" m_state="FI">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, fisheries policy is one of Europe’s greatest failures. The fundamental problem is widespread overfishing in all EU seas. That is by far the greatest challenge we have to deal with when we reform our common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Two thirds of Europe’s fish stocks are currently overfished. The situation is worst in the Mediterranean. There, an entire 82% of stocks are overfished above the level that has been scientifically determined to be sustainable. However, the situation is almost as alarming in all of Europe’s seas. This goes, in particular, for my native waters, the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Overfishing means, in practice, that there is overcapacity in the fishing fleet and that too many vessels are hunting for too few fish. In Europe, there is no definition of overcapacity. Since Commissioner Damanaki is here, I will therefore take the opportunity once again to ask for such a definition. A definition would mean that it would no longer be possible for anyone to say that overcapacity or overfishing does not exist. Therefore, we need a definition in order to be able to hold a clearer political debate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Overfishing is not only an ecological disaster; it is also an economic and social disaster. In the last 10 years, European fish catches have diminished from 5.5 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes. At the same time, it is estimated that 130 000 jobs have been lost in the fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The World Bank estimates that global overfishing costs the world around EUR 40 billion per year. That is equivalent to Finland’s state budget.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The poor state of fish stocks has also made it necessary to subsidise the fishing industry using public funds, which readily results in continued overfishing. At times of financial austerity, I think that taxpayers’ money could be put to considerably better use. We must therefore make fishing profitable again, like it was for thousands of years in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">One of the main points of the report by myself and my predecessor, Carl Haglund, is to achieve a maximum sustainable yield by 2015. Maximum sustainable yield means not catching fish faster than the time it takes for the fish stocks to replenish themselves. It sounds rather logical and simple but, unfortunately, it is not a foregone conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another key point is to obtain a ban on discards. Currently, 1.7 million tonnes of dead fish are thrown overboard every year. A policy is only as good as its implementation. We must therefore ensure that the decisions taken concerning the reform of the common fisheries policy are actually followed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As things stand, many Member States are very lax when it comes to reporting the actual size of their fishing fleet, among other things. This, in turn, makes it difficult to estimate how large the overcapacity is. There are currently few sanctions that can be used against those who break the rules. I therefore propose an option to freeze the EU aid from the common European Maritime and Fisheries Fund for countries that do not comply with the legislation and rules that we have adopted.</p>
      <p sl="sv">These three things should form part of the core of the new fisheries policy that we are to decide on this year and that will affect the fisheries sector for the next 10 years. The Australians and Americans have shown that the right political measures are important. They were once in the same situation in which Europe now finds itself, but they succeeded in breaking out of the downward spiral.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This therefore sounds like the right approach for Europe to take, and it is something we can achieve if we take the right decisions during the forthcoming reform.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I apologise to the House for my late appearance. I was with my Scottish colleagues, speaking to a visitors’ group from Scotland about the mackerel war and the fisheries debates.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, let me thank all of the shadow rapporteurs, and my other colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, for their help and cooperation throughout my work on the CMO report. I believe that we have arrived at a good conclusion, as this is the first of three legislative reports which will comprehensively reform the common fisheries policy. I think there are many interesting signposts in this CMO package which point the way for the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the key issues which have dominated our discussion on CFP reform has, of course, been the need to end micro-management from Brussels, which has bedevilled the sector for decades, and replace micro-management with meaningful regionalisation. Under such a system, the Commission will set the framework for the CFP and devolve day-to-day management to the stakeholders themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore emphasise the need for an enhanced role for producer organisations (POs), which will be best placed to assist with the day-to-day organisation of effort limitation, quota management, by-catch avoidance and dealing with fish landed under the discards ban. Given this enhanced role, I have also said that the criteria for setting up a PO should be clearly defined as regards the minimum number of participants, and I have suggested where transnational POs and associations of POs can provide useful partnerships to ensure a level playing field in respect of common and binding rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also makes several suggestions on labelling, including the need for clear information for consumers on origin, method and data production. Also, the area where the fish was caught should be expressed in terms that are familiar to the consumer. I have also suggested that the date of landing should be mandatory, and the date of catch voluntary. In addition, an innovation which won general support in committee is the voluntary use of an EU eco-label.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also encourages Member States to make full use of modern technology, utilising funding from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund to combine information that is already available through electronic logbooks, VMS and CCTV to increase market intelligence and increase profitability for everyone in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">On discards, we vetoed the idea of distributing fish free to charities, hospitals and schools, as this would undermine the market. We have placed all of the emphasis on by-catch avoidance, but suggested that fish landed under any discard ban should be used for pet food, fish meal, fish oil, or for bait. Mature commercial species landed under the discard ban should be sold in the normal way, with PO members receiving some small reimbursement to cover their costs for such landings, and the remainder going to a conservation fund. It is imperative, however, that reimbursements should not be set at a level that might encourage the targeting of juvenile fish.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, may I start by thanking my colleagues and rapporteurs Mr Stevenson, Mr Gallagher, Mr Haglund and Mr Torvalds, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their assistance in the drafting of this report. My thanks in particular to the shadow rapporteurs and my associate Ms Zacharaki, who worked on this matter. Fisheries are, without doubt, at a crucial turning point. The previous reform of the common fisheries policy did not manage to achieve the basic targets set, as the European Commission itself admits. However, we must put that down to experience as well.</p>
      <p sl="el">At this very moment, we are being given the opportunity and the means to carry out an in-depth reform that will pave the way for sustainable European fisheries, both from an environmental point of view and from a socio-economic point of view. The European Union represents about 4.6% of global fisheries and aquaculture production, which makes it the world’s fourth biggest producer. Nevertheless, 60% of the fish consumed in the European Union are imported. According to information available, 75% of the Union’s fish stocks are overexploited and more than 60% of fish stocks in European waters are being fished beyond the maximum sustainable yield.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union loses potential income in the order of EUR 1.8 billion per year as a result of its failure to manage its fisheries sustainably. At the same time, it lost 30% of its jobs between 2002 and 2007. We therefore need to make fisheries environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. These are the pillars underpinning the report being presented to you.</p>
      <p sl="el">Particular emphasis is placed, chapter by chapter, on the maximum sustainable yield. Achieving production at maximum sustainable yield is an ambitious objective that will help to allow fish stocks to recover. The admittedly poor state of our stocks is such that we need to be ambitious, especially in this phase, when we have an historic opportunity to lay the foundations of European fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report highlights the difficulties inherent in implementing the maximum sustainable yield principle, in particular, in the case of mixed fisheries or where scientific data to support it are inadequate. This should be a focal point of the Commission and of Ms Damanaki, whom I also thank for her assistance. I also thank her office for its assistance and advice during the drafting of this report. The Commission is called upon to increase financing for the Member States for secure and reliable data collection. I believe that the reliability and availability of their data should be one of the most important priorities of the reform.</p>
      <p sl="el">My colleagues who have already spoken mentioned the measure of eliminating discards. This is a measure that concerns us, because it is without doubt unacceptable for us to throw food fit for consumption back into the sea. At this time, in this recession, we are all aware of the wastage of resources that this practice represents and how destructive it is for the environment and for the viability of stocks.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is all I have to say, because my colleagues, whose reports are fully in keeping with my report, have covered what I wanted to say. Thank you once again and please support my report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first thank the four rapporteurs, Mr Gallagher, Mr Stevenson, Mr Torvalds and Mr Salavrakos, for their presentations and for their outstanding work. I would also like to greet Commissioner Damanaki and her commitment and ambition in advancing the reform of our fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a great honour for me to be here today to present the Council views on the very important topics that we plan to discuss. These include of course, as we said, the reform of the common fisheries policy. I look forward to working very closely with you in the codecision procedure as we advance a very important legislative agenda with a significant impact on EU citizens. Therefore, I would like to stress my commitment to making our joint work successful and rewarding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the common fisheries policy reform, the Council launched its debate horizontally in July last year. That debate took into account the Commission communications on which Mr Haglund and Mr Salavrakos have prepared reports. Since then, the Council has focused on the common market organisation and the regulation on the common fisheries policy, reaching a general approach in June of this year. In addition, the Council agreed on conclusions for the external fisheries policy in March of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council’s position on the common market organisation enlarges the role and responsibility of producer organisations towards promoting more sustainable fishing activities, taking on tasks related to fisheries management and on handling unwanted catches that fishermen will have to land after the implementation of the discard ban.</p>
      <p sl="en">On public market interventions, the Council agrees with the Commission that these interventions should be scaled down. Storage aid should be the only remaining intervention and Member States are not yet in agreement on whether these should be completely phased out over time.</p>
      <p sl="en">On consumer information, the Council agrees with the Commission that product labels should have to report on whether the fish has been defrosted before marketing, but the Council disagrees with the Commission’s proposal that the date of catch should be mandatory as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the reform in general, the Council’s position can be summarised as follows: management of fish stocks needs to achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2015, where possible, and by 2020 at the latest. New multiannual plans should better reflect the interdependence of fish stocks and fisheries and apply the maximum sustainable yield policy to all stocks which are significant in the area of the multiannual plan. Discard reductions should be at the forefront of the fisheries reform, accompanied by a landing obligation which will be phased in according to a timetable.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to welcome the European Parliament’s support for a more regionalised common fisheries policy with better involvement of stakeholders and reinforced advisory councils. The Council agrees with this pillar of the reform, and its general approach contains procedures for putting regionalisation into practice as well as reinforcing the role of advisory councils.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to transferable fishing concessions, many Member States are cautious concerning their effectiveness in fighting over-capacity and are concerned about possible unintended consequences. The general approach therefore foresees the introduction of transferable fishing concessions on a voluntary basis, while improving the existing mechanism to report on over-capacity and to take measures for fleet capacity adjustment. The link between fleet capacity and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be further explored by ministers during their September meeting in two weeks’ time, preparing for a partial general approach at the October Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not need to stress that the EMFF’s role in the reform will now be the focus of our discussions, in particular, its importance for growth, boosting aquaculture, creating more jobs and helping to implement the new common fisheries policy. With the new Council conclusions on the external dimension, the Council has set a more detailed framework for bilateral fisheries agreements, based on sustainability, and has given policy directions for the Union’s work in regional and multilateral fisheries organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, as a testimony to the success we can achieve together, I would like to thank Mr Gallagher for his outstanding work on the trade measures file which is expected to be adopted by our two institutions by the end of this month. This is a far-reaching piece of legislation which will enable the European Union to adopt effective measures against third countries allowing non-sustainable fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the most recent such case that comes to our minds is the situation of the north-east Atlantic mackerel stock. We all know that unfortunately, the latest attempt to find a solution acceptable to all did not succeed last week in London. I would like to recall the July Council’s desire to find a suitable compromise for this very unfortunate situation, but not at any price. Thanks to this legislation, we now have an additional instrument to use against such non-sustainable management practices.</p>

    <intervention id="2-648-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, since my time is limited, I would like to focus on certain issues. I hope that you will forgive me for not referring to all the issues that the rapporteurs have already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank everybody – Mr Gallagher, Mr Stevenson, Mr Torvalds and of course Mr Haglund, who is a former member of this House, and Mr Salavrakos for their work. I am pleased and I think that the Commission can be pleased because all the reports point in the same direction. This is a very important direction for us. It means more sustainable fishing inside and outside the EU. This is the main message of our proposal referring to the reform and I am happy to see this message in all the reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to comment on some issues now, beginning with Mr Salavrakos’s report. I would like to welcome the call from this House to restore and maintain stocks above the maximum sustainable yield. This is a very important message for us all and I hope that Parliament will uphold this message until the end of the debate and the negotiations. We would like to have the maximum sustainable yield introduced in our final text. It will be very important to have this as part of our new fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank Mr Salavrakos because he has made a very good basis for the further discussion of our proposal for a discard ban. I know that this is a very difficult exercise. We have discussed this in this House on other occasions with many of you. The Commission would like to cooperate with the Council and I welcome the presence of the Council here. If we are going to find a step by step approach or an approach that is gradual for the timeline, we need a clear and binding solution for discard and this is the way we are going to negotiate and discuss and cooperate with everybody around this very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now move onto Mr Torvalds’s and Mr Haglund’s report. I fully agree that long-term management plans should be the basis of our policy because uncertainty is our enemy. We have to tackle this problem through long-termism instead of going for micro-management and a short-termist approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">But you know that there is a problem here. There is a deadlock between the Council and Parliament. The Commission is here to facilitate, but you must discuss this between you. I am very happy to have you both here and I would like to be completely open. We can do everything but we really need progress, and progress can only be achieved by compromise. If the Council stays in the same position and Parliament stays in the same position, there will be no progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, this deadlock underlines the situation and the fact that we cannot say that the discard ban is only going to be implemented if we have long-term management plans in place. This very deadlock provides the real answer to how the discard ban will then be taken hostage by this situation. So I would like to urge you to support removing the link between the discard ban and the long-term management plans in this report. We cannot proceed this way. The long-term management plans – and it is not our problem – will take many years to be a reality for all fish stocks. The discard ban is very urgent as Mr Salavrakos and others have already underlined.</p>
      <p sl="en">And now for Mr Stevenson’s report. I am really satisfied that the report maintains the drive of our proposal. However, I would like to stress the issue of labelling once more and I would like to underline that I think that we are here to protect the interests of our citizens – not only of our fishermen but also of our consumers – and we have to keep the right balance between these approaches. That is why I think that the consumers have the right to have clear and very comprehensive information about the fish they buy. We have several ways of doing that, but I would like to focus mainly on two.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, in our opinion, the date of catch is absolutely essential, for consumers. It is absolutely essential for our fishermen, for the small-scale fisheries and also for the fishermen that are in the coastal areas. Why? Because the date of catch will be a great weapon in their hands.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are talking here a lot about small-scale fisheries. Can we ignore their interests? Because this is what is happening. If we are going to remove the date of catch, the fact that information is added in one way or another is not a matter of indifference. The date of catch is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give you another example. In France, for example, or in Spain, we have this French or Spanish law about the category of fishermen that return to port within 24 hours. A lot of them are not small-scale but they are coastal fisheries and these will use this date of catch to their advantage. I would like to urge you to go for this information for consumers. I would like also to call on the Council to reconsider this approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I think that prepared and preserved products should show the fish name, origin and production method. I really do not see why the processed products have to miss that information out. Why? I think that the consumer has to know. He has to know and he has to make his own decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">So one last point about eco-labelling. I know that many of you have proposed an eco-labelling approach, so what I can promise is that by 1 January 2015, the Commission will make a report. We will come to you with our proposals and then we can decide together if we are going for an eco-labelling approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, on the trade instrument, I think we have to congratulate Mr Gallagher because he has done a lot of work and we have succeeded in having this instrument in place as soon as possible. Time matters here and I am really grateful that we have gone into this exercise so swiftly. I think that this is a very important proposal by the Commission, and I hope that Parliament and the Council can work together on this. Why? Because it can contribute a lot to creating a level playing field between our fishermen and the fishermen of other countries, non-EU Member States with whom we share the same stocks. We have discussed level playing fields a lot so we have to introduce this trade instrument and I hope that we can do it as soon as possible. I also think that this will reignite confidence in our policy, in the Commission services, in the way we treat our fishermen. It is really very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, of course, is disappointed because we have not reached an agreement with other coastal areas about mackerel stocks. I would just like to say that I am preparing to have everything in order if you vote for this instrument. I have to underline that there are many legal procedures that have to be taken account of.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of Maurice Ponga, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on the report by Mr Gallagher.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important to note that the European Commission, when it wishes to impose sanctions on a country for unsustainable fishing practises, must take into account that country’s level of development. This is because, according to the principle of policy coherence with development goals, it is crucial, in my opinion, that the measures adopted for fisheries do not undermine the development plans and strategies implemented by the European Union in the countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Gallagher’s draft report takes up this important idea for our Committee on Development, specifying that the measures should not be unjustified or even discriminatory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on the European Commission, when it adopts such measures, to respect this principle of policy coherence with development objectives and to duly consider the level of development and the vulnerability of countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, dear colleagues, we are approaching a real crunch time in the debate over the future common fisheries policy, and the question is: will it be a success, or will it continue to be a disaster? At the moment, I see two real, major threats that could destroy all the good work that has been done by the rapporteurs, Mr Haglund, Mr Salavrakos, Mr Stevenson and also Ms Rodust, and the extremely long work and analyses carried out by the Commission and the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first of these threats is paragraph 58 of the Salavrakos report, which calls for fleet renewal. The EU got rid of subsidies for building new fishing vessels in the last reform in 2002, and still the fleet suffers from enormous over-capacity. It would be completely irresponsible to reintroduce this now, in the middle of the economic crisis, when we should have learnt our lesson. That lesson is that the best way to let the fishing industry become economically prosperous is to rebuild fish stocks to a level above maximum sustainable yield.</p>
      <p sl="en">This leads me to the other threat to a successful reformed fisheries policy, namely Amendment 2 to the Salavrakos report, which seeks to delete the word ‘above’ from ‘above MSY’. That would be an extremely serious mistake. Study after study has shown that if we keep stocks above MSY level, the industry will enjoy greater stability and earn more money, and investments will be much safer. This is also what the pelagic RAC stated in the Committee on Fisheries. It would give us a better marine environment and is consistent with a precautionary approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Stevenson report, we support the mandatory provision of information to consumers on the date of catch and the gear type that has been used. This should also apply for processed products.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Blue-card question . – Mr President, Ms Lövin mentioned the over-capacity of the European fleet in general and she mentioned it with a view to stating that there should be no further aid for fleet renewal. I should like to say to her that we are talking about very different things when we talk about the European fleet. For example, the average ages of the fleets of the various countries, the various Member States, are profoundly different: we have countries whose fleets have an average age of 20 years or more, and we have other countries with fleets that are far more modern.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to ask her whether she believes all countries should be treated equally and, if so, whether that represents a death sentence for fishing activity in those countries whose fleets have a much higher average age than others.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – I am actually convinced that, with just a few years of recovery of the fish stocks in Europe, all the European fleets will be in a much better economic situation. I think that fishermen, as well as all other economic entrepreneurs, have the obligation to see to it that their activity is economically viable. They should be able to invest in their own renewal of their own fishing vessels. It should not be up to European taxpayers to provide for that.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the common market organisation (CMO) for fisheries products is one of the pillars of the common fisheries policy (CFP) and the first regulation in the legislative package that will set out the future CFP, to be voted on here in Parliament. It is clear that the CMO’s main objectives still have not been realised, specifically ensuring market stability and guaranteeing producers a fair income. The income crisis affecting the fisheries sector, which has – let us not delude ourselves – consequences for the conservation status of stocks … As I was saying, this income crisis has various causes, including the way in which the sector is currently marketed, the unbalanced distribution of value added along the sector’s value chain and the way in which first-sale prices are formulated. Moreover, fishing is, by its very nature, irregular. This irregularity implies a need for public funding from either national governments or the EU, for example, supporting fishers during biological rest periods. It also implies the creation of effective market intervention mechanisms that are duly funded from the EU budget from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The current situation means we need an ambitious reform of the CMO that reinforces its instruments; its mechanisms for public intervention in markets. This is – I repeat – also necessary in order to conserve stocks. Regrettably, the Commission and the rapporteur are heading in the opposite direction, by means of dismantling the already scant extant regulatory instruments, of more liberalisation and of their precious market orientation. In other words, faced with the disasters of neoliberalism, the fundamentalist believers in the invisible hand continue to suggest the same path.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This proposal ignores the reality of the sector in the various Member States. It ignores the very incipient level of producer organisation in a number of countries, particularly as regards small-scale coastal fishing sectors. It also fails to respond to the need to revalue the first-sale price of fish, so it does not contribute to reducing the pressure on stocks. In short, regrettably, this report does not respond to the sector’s problems and creates others. It has been written in line with the interests of the few and against the interests of the many.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Blue-card answer. – Our answer is very clear and we have been expressing it in the numerous draft amendments we have been tabling to the various reports under discussion. We believe it is local management that best serves the interests of stocks and fishers. The local management that we advocate is the antithesis of the centralised management we have had for the last 20 or 30 years; centralised management that the Treaty of Lisbon has, unfortunately, consolidated by enshrining the management of living marine biological resources as an exclusive EU competence. We are now running into the negative consequences of this, first and foremost because of the constraints that the Commission says bind it as regards further decentralising the common fisheries policy and promoting the local management that we advocate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the future common fisheries policy (CFP) should focus on its environmental, economic and social aspects, in a cooperative and non-hierarchical way that favours sustainable development and is in line with the Europe 2020 strategy’s targets of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to stress the specific nature of some regions, such as the outermost regions, whose economies are very dependent on the fisheries sector. In these regions, CFP reform should seek to ensure the survival and future prosperity of their small-scale coastal fishing fleets, thereby safeguarding and defending the jobs dependent on them. I agree with the Commission’s position on the need to adjust this policy and for specific measures, which should take into account the disparate realities of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the various coastal regions. I advocate this policy emphasising regionalisation as a form of governance by increasing the participation of the various stakeholders so as to enable, in future, the most appropriate response to the requirements and sensitivities of each sea basin.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their reports, but may I highlight the excellent collaboration with Mr Gallagher, which has led to the adoption at first reading, with the agreement of all the institutions, of measures that will enable swift action to be taken to put an end to unsustainable situations, such as we are experiencing with Iceland and the distribution of mackerel stocks.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the Stevenson report on the common organisation of the market (CMO), I shall make particular reference to the chapter on consumer information, to which Commissioner Damanaki referred, in which I believe the compromises reached clarify and simplify the original proposal. Commissioner, I believe that proposal confused quantity of information with quality of information, since it would – as in the case of Article 42(2) – call for a whole series of data to be given, complicating and unnecessarily increasing the costs to the industry, without being of any relevance to consumers, who would also be incapable of assimilating so many details.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have also tried to find a balance between the interests of the various segments of the fleet and industry. For example, the obligation to show the date of catch is in the interests of the smaller-scale fishing fleets but is very detrimental for the other fleets catching fresh fish, without affecting the quality of the catch. Replacing it with the date of landing, as included in the compromise reached, gives the consumer the same guarantees while allowing the date of catch to be included as part of the voluntary information, if so wished.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, sustainability must be a key criterion for the EU, regardless of whether fishing takes place in the Pacific, in the Indian Ocean or in the Atlantic. For certain highly migratory fish stocks, however, sustainable management will require cooperation between the countries exploiting the resources. When some countries choose to increase their own quotas off their own backs, it is at the cost of the resources that we are all dependent on and benefit from. It is therefore important that the EU has general, effective and reasonable incentives to counter overfishing and to promote our shared objective of healthy fish stocks the world over. For the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, it was crucial to have measures that are effective, but at the same time practicable under international trade law. We now have that, and it is a victory for sustainability.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have to ask the question, why do they not get it? Why is it that some members of the EPP, from the Italian, Spanish and French delegations, just do not get it?</p>
      <p sl="de">We have been overfishing. The problem for the fishing industry is that there are now too few fish. We have to rebuild fish stocks. That is at the heart of the Commission’s proposals – that we need to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but not just MSY. We need to set levels above MSY. We need to rebuild those stocks to give industry a future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet 70 EPP members have signed an amendment to delete that word ‘above’. They are basically saying ‘we do not care about rebuilding fish stocks’.

I urge them to think again.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to subscribe 100% to what my colleague Lövin has said. I would refer, basically, to the Gallagher report. The fact that the EU, on the one hand, and Iceland and the Faroes, on the other, have been waging a – mostly diplomatic – war over quotas for mackerel in the north-east Atlantic has had as a consequence that the fish is being severely overfished, for the EU and Norway maintain their historic quotas, while Iceland and the Faroes have declared large unilateral quotas. The total catches thus far exceed the scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">This being so, it means that if a country fails in its international obligations regarding fisheries management, the EU can threaten an import ban on any fishery product coming from that country that swims in the same ecosystem. This is a significant step down the path of ensuring that only sustainably caught fish enters international trade. However, its importance depends upon the EU market, which is currently huge, though there are alternatives, especially in emerging markets such as China, Brazil, etc. Nonetheless, it is a very positive outcome.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs and, in particular, I would like to thank and congratulate Struan Stevenson for the enormous amount of work that he put into preparing his report. It is worth noting that the rapporteur took part in very many meetings, not just with shadow rapporteurs and interested Members of the European Parliament, but also with a large number of fishermen, industry representatives and scientists, and I would like to offer my special thanks for that fact.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report lays emphasis on the future of small-scale fishing, which plays a very important role in the economies of EU Member States. This consists, primarily, of family businesses, which are particularly sensitive to the functioning of, and changes in, the single market. Where individual fishermen compete with industrial fishing, the individual will always lose. I hope that this report will not only help to preserve small-scale fishing, but will also enable the fishing sector to be competitive while maintaining its varied structure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with fish stocks in serious decline in Europe’s rich fishing grounds, the CFP is a failure. Yet these reports are laced with the same old Eurospeak – regulation, restriction, prohibit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before the CFP, most European fishermen, unhampered by bureaucratic interference, had been fishing responsibly, looking after their own waters and therefore handing on viable fisheries down the generations. But the EU destroyed this culture of care and so now we have rules about total permissible catch and the wretched discard policy, which has decimated stocks.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you do not like lessons from the past, then try the present. Norway and Iceland still record good catches and find many species spawning well, but then they ban discards and other destructive EU measures which, as noted in these reports, have reduced EU fishing fleets. The UK fishing fleet is barely half its former size and so much of the fish sold in the UK now comes from Iceland. What an indictment of the CFP.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this third reform of the common fisheries policy must not take place, once again, at the expense of fishermen. Not all fishermen are these plunderers of the sea, the only people responsible for the poor state of the stocks, as is suggested by environmental organisations and the European Commission, grouping together all fishing categories.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course we need to preserve fish stocks, but we also need to allow our fishermen to make a living from their work and preserve the economic fabric, dynamism and cultural identity of our coastal regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the main measures of the European executive once again aim to reduce the number of fishermen to achieve the mythical ‘maximum sustainable yield’. I would like to point out that the French fleet has decreased by more than 50% since 1980.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is proposing, in particular, the introduction of transferable individual quotas, which are a measure of the industrialisation and concentration of the sector, and even a complete ban on discards, which the experts describe as unrealistic. This draft reform probably suits the industrial fleet but, as it stands, it would be the scheduled death of what remains of local and small-scale fisheries.</p>

We are talking about a product that is a food, and which we claim enhances the ‘healthy diet’ needed for both children and adults.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, these reports encompass some of the key issues involved in the ongoing CFP reform debate. On discards, we all agree that this scandalous waste of food must be ended, but we must accept that the CFP and its detailed rules are a significant cause of discards. The cod recovery plan and its catch composition rules are directly causing substantial amounts of wastage through discards.</p>
      <p sl="en">On decentralisation, let us allow Europe’s fishing nations to decide, working together in logical sea basins, how best to conserve their stocks, because it is their future and they who will have the most incentive to make it work.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, our fisheries sector is losing jobs; biodiversity and the marine environment are under threat. Commissioner Damanaki’s proposal has pointed the way towards sustainable fisheries in Europe, but the EU’s fisheries ministers agreed on a reform that presents a frightening future for the sector, including the deferral of maximum sustainable yields (MSY) until 2020. Over the past 10 years, overfishing has resulted in the loss of 30% of the jobs in the sector, but the introduction of MSY from 2015 would give fish stocks some rest time to re-establish themselves, allowing us to restore a greater number of jobs from 2020.</p>
      <p sl="da">Mr Salavrakos’ report sends a strong signal to the Council and the Commission that we will not accept short-sighted national interests again being given priority. We need the fleet capacity to be reduced to a sustainable level. This is the first time that the European Parliament has been colegislator on fisheries policy.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, if I may, I shall use my speech in this joint debate on fisheries policy in order to make some demands.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, we are debating good reports that properly define Parliament’s efforts to achieve sustainable fishing by preserving fish stocks, and which try to establish a common organisation of the markets in which consumers are not only protected but also well informed. In addition, we are stressing the need to take action against those who authorise unsustainable fishing, and we are doing so by discussing, debating and reaching agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately, however, those efforts clash with the actions of those who sometimes confuse confidentiality with a lack of transparency, with protocol negotiations carried out behind Parliament’s back and, what is worse, behind the backs of those who should be benefiting from the very same agreement. Commissioner Damanaki, there is still time to rectify this situation. Please do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our efforts also clash with those who are less concerned about blocking instruments that are fundamental to developing the sector as they are about not losing powers which even the Treaty does not bestow on them. Mr Mavroyiannis, we still have time. Stop blocking the management plans. It is important for the fishing industry and therefore for the citizens of Europe and for us.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, at a time of uncertainty with so many boats and so few fishing opportunities, with fierce competition from imported products and a considerable reduction in subsidies, we have an obligation to support this reform. We should do so bearing in mind the fishermen in Galicia, Andalusia, the Canary Islands and all the other regions of Europe. They expect something very simple from us: that we do not let them down.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, we have to face the evidence that all the available data are pointing to, which is the depletion of fish stocks. Some fish stocks have been seriously jeopardised, and therefore our objective must be to guarantee sustainable fishing if we wish to increase future fish production in our seas.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today’s debate is an anticipation of some of the central issues of the common fisheries policy. The lack of reliable data means that it is not possible to reach a shared definition of over-capacity, and it is crucial to avoid the risk of adopting measures that could penalise fishermen, given the serious crisis that has hit the sector. Fishing needs to continue to be an important source of employment and sustenance for families.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, with some of the reports under discussion today being tabled and voted on, common fisheries policy (CFP) reform has now started to take shape. I would therefore congratulate their respective rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, and thank them for the work they have done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We all know that the reform needs to be profound and that resource sustainability is our lowest common denominator. We also know that the situation in the sector must change, so the challenges it faces will be tough. It is incumbent on all of us to work to ensure the continuation of fishing and related activities, by promoting stock sustainability. It is incumbent on all of us to respond positively to the various interests in play, whilst accepting the complexities of dialogue and consensus building. We must not, as seems to be the fashion at the moment, self-interestedly and irresponsibly adopt the simplest solutions, seeking the approval of the masses by making ourselves hostages to populism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us not forget that we are Members of this House and of the Committee on Fisheries, whilst you are Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. There can be no reform, whether superficial or the profound reform we want this to be, against the sector or without the sector. Other politicians have failed because they made this mistake. They lost, the sectors in which nothing changed lost and we, too, have been left with everything to lose. True reform will have to involve the stakeholders in order to win their cooperation, without which it will be doomed to failure. Today’s reports are testimony to the change and dialogue required, because change is being implemented. I hope we will continue down this path.</p>

This, at least, is how it appears in theory.

Bold and courageous measures are required as never before by the urgent need to rebalance our fisheries resources in a sustainable manner, but also to revitalise our coastal fishing communities and boost their socio-economic level whilst modernising the sector and supplying high-quality foodstuffs. We therefore need to make choices and prioritise objectives. I have proposed protection for my region’s weaknesses. I have also suggested that the exploitation of its resources take into account the scientific data, prioritise the needs of our coastal communities and restrict outside vessels to a maximum distance of 100 nautical miles or to existing fisheries there. I have proposed safeguarding the fishing capacity of our major fishing communities and rejected proposals for transferable quotas. I have proposed that our communities be more involved in managing their fishing affairs, through the creation of a consultative regional council more suited to the outermost regions, and I hope this will enable us to have a better future.</p>

      <p sl="de">The fishing industry is not just a means of producing or catching food. It is the oldest trade in the world and, of course, we want to preserve it for the future. Therefore, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs. I believe that we have taken an important step forwards today and I know how committed Ms Damanaki is in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, we need aquaculture as a response to overfishing. I am very interested in an integrated maritime policy which is all about maritime environmental planning. There are some interesting concepts in this area involving, for example, integrating aquaculture into offshore wind farms. This may be something for the future, but we must ensure that we can expand this sector in the most effective way possible.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the fisheries policy should be reformed, because it is too greatly and too tightly controlled from Brussels. One of the things that is important is sustainable innovation in fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, sustainable innovation in fisheries is not always possible. I am referring specifically to the fishing technique called pulse trawling. In this method of fishing, the fish are startled from the seabed with electric shocks of a few volts. The advantage here is that the seabed is not damaged and the fuel consumption of ships is reduced by 40%. There is much less by catch and the yield is much higher. So, perfect!</p>

Let us therefore indeed ensure that no unenforceable rules find their way into the regulation. It would be wrong to arrive at a stalemate in the mixed fisheries sector with an unenforceable discard ban.

I hope you will bear with me for not being an expert on this – and, of course, I do not like to contradict my dear Commissioner Damanaki – but I must explain the rationale behind the Council’s position. The Council holds that the catch date is difficult to establish, and trace, on fishing trips lasting several days or weeks. On such trips, the fish is often immediately frozen on board and, therefore, kept in perfect condition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mandatory information exists already concerning package date and best-before date, and this information should be expanded to include qualitative information on whether the product was defrosted before selling. The catch or landing date could be part of the voluntary information whereby the producer or merchant seeks to distinguish one product from another.</p>

They have the most to lose. So we must ensure that we can arrive at an agreement in October.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I would like to make one final appeal, through this House, to all sides to get together and resolve this long-running dispute. A realistic solution is in the interests of all sides, but particularly the stakeholders, the fishing sector in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am hopeful that good sense will prevail and I believe that perhaps this is the time that we should, in advance of the October meeting, ask the representatives of the fishing organisations in the coastal states to come together and perhaps give their views and map a way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see that the chair of the Fisheries Committee is here as well as many of the shadows who are involved in this. I want to thank all of them for the role they played in the trialogue, together with the Commissioner’s officials and with the Presidency. I must say that, while I can be a critic at times of some of the institutions, I was more than impressed with the pragmatic attitude that they adopted at that meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, we have strengthened your hand. It will now be a matter for you to implement, if necessary, but I hope that it will not be necessary and that there will be a positive conclusion in October.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers in this debate for their kind words and can I also thank my assistant, Catherine Stack, for all the hard work she had done on this report. First of all, let me address one of the issues that the Commissioner brought up on multiannual plans, and I really want to address this to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Mavroyiannis, and say how much I support what the Commissioner said: without multiannual plans, President-in-Office, we have no effective CFP reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">You cannot say to our fishermen that you can have the confidence of stability in the sector for the months and years ahead unless we get multiannual plans in place. Three of our reports, including one from my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, have been blocked for over three years in this deadlock. This is no use. We really have to make some progress on this and I appeal to the Council to try to make a breakthrough on multiannual plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Mavroyiannis, I support the position that you have taken this evening on things like TFCs being voluntary, on boosting aquaculture, on the need for setting a deadline for MSY, on the discards ban and I also thoroughly agree with the Council position.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say this to Ms Damanaki on labelling. When I was in Galicia, the fishermen said to me that if coastal fishermen go out for several days and keep their catch on liquid ice, then when they land their catch, it is perfectly fresh and in great condition. Inshore fishermen may go out and come back in 24 hours but they have their catch lying in the sun for all of that time. The consumer, however, would be left with the impression from the mandatory date of catch that the poorer quality fish was actually better. I think that is unfair; it is an unfair advantage. Therefore, a voluntary label for date of catch and a mandatory label for date of landing are essential.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I had actually prepared a different speech but the discussion was so interesting that I scrapped it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Damanaki started her speech by asking for forgiveness. I think the priestly phrase goes, ‘ego te absolvo’: I grant her forgiveness. Then we have Minister Mavroyiannis. I am not going to forgive him because his stance on catch date actually stinks. It stinks of slightly old fish and I do not like it.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a Swedish saying that we skirt around a question like a cat moving around hot porridge. We are skirting around the question of technical improvements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have the feeling that Mr Ferreira has not read carefully the first part of Karl Marx’s ‘Das Kapital’ in which he describes the needle factory and needle manufacturing. The progress we have made in fishing is almost equivalent to what Karl Marx described 200 years ago. If Mr Ferreira’s point is that we should get on a level with all the fishing fleets in Europe before we can take any real measures, then that is a race to the bottom – the bottom of the sea that is. I think it is just illogical. It is a way of escaping the real question.</p>
      <p sl="en">So dear friends, we have been sitting here for a while, the discussion has been very interesting and it is set to go on for some time.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the other rapporteurs have already covered most of what I wanted to say in their presentations. What I want to point out is that I had certain principles in mind when I drafted this report: gentle adaptation of the legislative measure, feasibility and controllability of the measure, acceptability of the measure and permanence of the measure, because frequent changes are not constructive.</p>
      <p sl="el">I thank all my colleagues who helped me draft this report. However, I have not thanked the fishermen who will accept the outcome of this arrangement. I therefore wish to give the fishermen of Europe a polite reminder that Jesus Christ chose them as his disciples and, revealing the fishermen as most wise, gave them the power to be fishers of men. I wish to convey to them that we are looking to the future of fisheries, that we are aware of the history of fishing, and that we believe that fisheries will subsist well past 2020.</p>

      <p sl="pl">A properly functioning fisheries policy that markedly improves the competitiveness of the fisheries sector can have a positive impact on the entire European Union economy. Establishing maximum sustainable yield (MSY) thresholds will allow rational use of fish stocks and the creation of a stable, long-term strategy for this sector. The introduction of protection measures concerning such issues as the discards ban or the landing of all fish in port will have a positive impact on the ecosystem of fishing areas and the survival of endangered species of fish.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The common fisheries policy must also contain provisions to ensure the elimination of threats such as piracy or poaching. Full integration of the CFP with other policies, such as environmental policy or cohesion policy, will make it possible to increase economic prosperity throughout the European Union, particularly in regions where the economy is based, in large part, on this industrial sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">Proposed reform of common fisheries policy will not ensure sustainability nor lead to urgently needed economic reform. The lack of a bold revolution, necessary for schismatic reversal of fishing policy, confirms the EU is incapable of providing a fit-for-purpose solution to overfishing. A study by the New Economics Foundation shows many fish stocks could be rebuilt within five years through real time bans. Restored stocks would generate GBP 14.62 billion annual revenue, treble the value of fish landed at sustainable levels today. The only way to effectively manage dramatic policy change is to renationalise fishing rights. There are 500 registered boats in Welsh waters, yet 90% of catch is not landed in Wales. A large proportion of the offshore fleet is made up of vessels registered in Wales but owned by Spanish companies and some Dutch operators, who contribute nothing to the local economy. Most landings by the local fleet are also consigned to ports outside the region. While 75% of the Welsh coastline has protected status, Wales cannot promote sustainability nor would gain in doing so. Only renationalising waters would incentivise the stewardship of seas by guaranteeing future sustainable, profitable local maritime industries and fair international trade.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that the Commission’s proposal also to resort to other than just trade measures must be given full support. However, at the same time, I believe that a clearer approach is also required, with much tougher and more effective measures. The trade measures to be applied should not be limited to the import of ‘stocks of common interest’ and ‘associated species’ only, but should also be applicable to all imports of fish and fishery products of all species originating from countries allowing non-sustainable fishing.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Forecasts for fish stocks in Europe are frightening; they are expected to be exhausted in the coming decades. Policy on catches is still insufficiently coordinated. As a result, many species are already on the verge of extinction, including the most popular fish, such as salmon or tuna. For this reason, it is vital to embark on the necessary steps without delay, in order to prevent an ecological disaster and to prevent humanity from losing a variety of resources.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, it is essential immediately to prepare long-term plans to regulate fishing grounds, to provide additional funding for research and for stocking reservoirs, and to introduce strict controls ensuring compliance with bans on fishing in protected areas. However, when creating legislation, the variety and specific characteristics of the different European seas should be taken into account. In addition, we must not forget about the fishermen and producers that will be deprived of a living as a result of new legislation. The new budget should provide compensation for those who will bear the economic and social consequences of the reforms.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report takes the right approach by strengthening producer organisations, which are granted new powers to manage and market production. The text also introduces new provisions to ensure that consumers have more information about fresh products, such as the date of landing, the term ‘defrosted’ and the catch area. To go even further, the Commission should present a European eco-label to reward sustainable fishing practices.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I congratulate our fellow Member for the document that has been presented, which provides an excellent summary of the current challenges facing the fisheries sector. Furthermore, I would like to thank him for supporting the inclusion in this report of the provisions referring to the need for a new Regional Fisheries Management Organisation for the Black Sea. In actual fact, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) is not an adequate framework for managing the Black Sea, and the European Commission needs to put into practice its earlier commitment to set up a Black Sea Advisory Council. Moreover, we need to step up the dialogue with the countries bordering the Black Sea, particularly with regard to the exploitation and conservation of fish stocks.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am going to use this subject to touch on another point, which is the presence of a legislative vacuum regarding minimum landing sizes and minimum mesh sizes for nets for turbot. This year, Turkey blocked a decision on this matter from being adopted in the GFCM, providing an example to corroborate what has been stated so far.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Unfortunately, there are still many areas where the position of consumers in the single market needs to be improved. I have long held the view that one of these areas is greater consumer awareness, or the provision of factually accurate and non-misleading information, on the basis of which the consumer can make a choice. I therefore regard the correct labelling of products – especially food – as one of the most important consumer rights for all of us. One of the aims of this regulation is the labelling of fishery products. I agree with the rapporteur that consumers have the right to better and more comprehensible information on the fishery products they buy, in order to make an informed choice. I therefore do not understand why consumers are denied this information in the report – for example, through the proposal to remove data on the catch, which is information sought after and requested by consumers. Let us not deny consumers their right to a free choice based on true and full information.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We are preparing to vote on a number of texts that will define the future of European fishing. These texts affect hundreds of thousands of jobs, our food autonomy, the preservation of fish resources and the durability of an economic sector. Despite the fact that these major issues are evidently of general interest, the Commission has given its draft reform a very liberal slant. Parliament’s work has, of course, toned down these proposals. It is just a first step, however. Future work must go beyond declarations of intent. From now on, we have to build real tools to achieve an economic, social and environmental balance for this activity, in accordance with the EU’s 2020 strategy. It is just as essential to preserve jobs as it is to preserve resources. We urgently need to establish homogeneous controls throughout the Union. Similarly, we can no longer use different methods to collect scientific data. The renewal of the fleet is essential for the emergence of a future fishing sector that is more selective, safer, cleaner, and more efficient and thus more profitable. Otherwise, we will be left with one question: is the fisheries policy an exception to the 2020 strategy?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Antonyia Parvanova and Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime (COM(2011)0275 – C7-0127/2011 – 2011/0129(COD)) (A7-0244/2012).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am pleased and honoured to open this debate tonight presenting the agreement reached with the Council on the directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. For the first time since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty and the extension of its competences in this field, the European Union is about to adopt a Europe-wide law on the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our debate tonight, on a symbolic date for victims in the world and especially for victims of terrorism, is proof for even the most sceptical that the European Union is concerned with more than just the single market or budgetary control. Today, the European Union is delivering for its citizens and their rights. The agreement, which will be put to the vote tomorrow, is the result of long and sometimes difficult negotiations with Member States and the Commission. It has always been guided by one main principle: the interest of the victim and the support they need in getting through a process which can be particularly difficult for them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has rightly initiated this timely piece of legislation which will now guarantee to all victims of crime across Europe the same basic rights in criminal proceedings irrespective of where the crime took place and of the victim’s residence status. The future directive is also closing identified gaps in protection for victims, particularly those exposed to discrimination and victimisation such as children, victims of gender-based violence or victims of organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has stood firm on strengthening a needs-based approach in order to provide basic and tailored support for all victims, in particular, victims who are most at risk of repeated or further victimisation. A major change in the future is that all victims will now undergo an individual assessment in order to identify potential specific needs, notably based on their personal characteristics and the circumstances of the crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another key element of the agreement are procedural rights such as the right to be heard, the right to receive information about their case, including the time and place of the trial and the nature of the charges, the right of appeal and of access to victim support services, which have been significantly improved with the setting of minimum EU standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">As rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I am obviously pleased to see in this legislation provisions aimed at protecting and supporting victims of gender-based violence and victims of violence in close relationships, an issue which has been neglected or ignored for too long in our national systems. I would like to add that from a more procedural point of view, the cooperation between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights has proven successful and has allowed Parliament to stand firm on its position to address the needs of all victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must therefore conclude by thanking my colleague and co-rapporteur, Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, for her exceptional and fruitful cooperation on this dossier. I would also like to thank all shadow rapporteurs who have been actively and positively contributing to our work over the past months. The agreement reached today would not exist without the courageous initiative launched by the Commission and its active support in reaching compromises during the negotiations. I would also like to thank Commissioner Reding, her staff and acknowledge their excellence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also recognise the leading role of the Danish Presidency of the EU in making a consensus possible among Member States. It has been very successful and has given a positive outcome. I am hopeful and look forward to your questions and positive support.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, today is a very important day for all victims, particularly victims of terrorism, because on 11 September 2001, more than 3 000 innocent people died in several terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot forget those who died in London and Madrid, or the many victims of terrorism in Europe, such as those of the ETA terrorist organisation in Spain, my country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Society as a whole is the victim in a terrorist attack, but a few citizens pay with their lives to defend our freedom.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why, Mr President, I am dedicating part of my speaking time, including the time I have been allocated at the end of the debate, to observe one minute’s silence for all of these victims.</p>
      <a text="(The House observed a minute’s silence)"/>
      <p sl="es">I should like to thank Commissioner Reding for the sensitivity she has shown towards victims, also the Council for its flexibility, and Ms Parvanova for her excellent work, as well as the Members of Parliament who have followed this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">Tomorrow will be crucial not only for victims but for all citizens, and believe me when I say that anyone can become a victim, as we can see from this compelling statistic: 75 million people a year are victims of crime in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe it is time to give the victims the place they deserve, that is, at the centre of our debates in Parliament, because, even though the economic situation is our main concern today, I know that in most European countries, people are extremely worried about the way the justice system functions. This directive, which sends a clear message to victims that their rights will not be ignored and that they will be treated with respect and dignity, will serve to build people’s confidence in justice.</p>
      <p sl="es">The response to victims’ call for justice begins in Europe: a transparent and effective framework that restores citizens’ rights and the hope they have lost, in some cases, in their judicial system.</p>
      <p sl="es">Irrespective of their nationality or the place where the crime was committed, the victims will have the right to be informed, to understand and be understood, to legal counsel, and to be heard and protected. Victim support services will be able to provide psychological support and defend the victims at all times.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have heard many victims’ accounts, all of which were very traumatic, but necessary in order to understand the needs of the different types of victims; I would like to add that I dedicate this directive to them, especially to my brother, Alberto, and his wife, who will be looking down on me from heaven.</p>
      <p sl="es">In Parliament today, we are taking an important first step towards helping a father who has lost his son in another country, the victim of an attack, or a girl who has been raped and has no idea where to begin or what to tell the police. They are forced to go through that nightmare, and we are helping all of them here today.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope this compass guides not only victims when they are crossing the desert of criminal proceedings, but also all those who must support them on their path of pain, such as judges, police officers and legal experts, including in cases involving children, and I also dedicate this directive to them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today is a very important day for all victims: victims of gender violence, people trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, as well as child victims, victims with disabilities, and all those who have experienced the ordeal of a crime.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately, we cannot bring back people’s loved ones, nor can we restore their honour, the peace of mind they have lost, or their health, but all of us here today can promise them that we shall continue working towards giving them back their rights, dignity and belief in justice.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am committing myself and I call on the whole of Parliament to do the same with me tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very moved. I am moved because we have two wonderful rapporteurs who, in their diversity, managed to bring to this House and to our action the human feelings and the emotions which we need in our European policy making.</p>
      <p sl="en">European policy making is not about institutions; it is not about this Parliament; it is not about the Commission; it is not about giving power to Brussels. European policy making is about giving help to people, making them feel that Europe is their place to be, that wherever they go they will feel secure, that somebody cares, and the question of victims which we discussed today is a very good example of this Europe we are building together.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I became Commissioner for Justice, I had to look at criminal justice and I discovered that of course, in the different Member States, we have very different systems. They all have grown, some over centuries and some over decades. They are all sui generis and they all have their values, but they are very different.</p>
      <p sl="en">What about the citizens who are travelling from one country to another – whether as tourists or students, or because they want to work in a neighbouring country? They are lost when they find themselves victims in a system they do not know, because it is their home system that they are primarily aware of. That was the first element.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second element was when I analysed what is happening in criminal justice, I saw that everything revolves around the criminal, the one who has committed a crime; but in most of our justice systems, the victims of crime receive no attention. That is the person who really counts – or indeed ‘the persons’ if we look at the family of those victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had a very important experience with a mother, a mother whose son had been severely injured during a holiday trip to a beautiful southern island. This mother’s name is Maggie Hughes, and when she wanted to help her son, she had no possibility of helping him. She went to a foreign country, she did not understand the language, she could not speak to the doctors, she could not speak to the police, she had nobody to help her.</p>
      <p sl="en">What did this woman do after this terrible experience? She did not come to me and say: can you not do this or that for my son? She asked me: can you not draw up European legislation so that what I have lived through will never happen to another mother? That was the origin of what we are discussing today. That was the origin of saying: yes, we put people at the centre of our European endeavours; yes, we are making laws which will help our people, our 500 million citizens, so that wherever they go and whatever happens to them, they will feel at home in the place where they have a problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, thank you Parliament, thank you Council. Thank you for having made this possible. I think that the message we give today on 11 September, when we think about victims of terrorism, is that we also think about all victims. We think about the woman who has been raped; we think about the child who finds himself without any help; we think about the people who have been burgled; we think about the wife whose husband has been murdered in a neighbouring country; and we say ‘how can we help them so that they get their rights?’</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are doing today is not about the direct victims, it is also about the families of those victims who very often feel completely alone and helpless. In future, Europe is going to be there in order to help them. They are going to be part of the judicial system. The police are going to be specially trained to care for victims’ needs. Victims will get information from the point of first contact with the authorities; they will be provided with interpretation and translation to enable their participation in the court action.</p>
      <p sl="en">They will get specialist support, targeted for victims of sexual violence, victims of gender-based violence, victims of domestic violence, and children who are always going to be considered vulnerable. Particular attention will be paid to some categories of victims, victims of terrorism, organised crime, human trafficking, gender-based violence, sexual violence, exploitation, hate crime, victims of disabilities. They are all human beings and our responsibility here is to care for them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our victims package of today, our directive, our European law, is going to be the first step to address the rights for victims of crime across the European Union. We are going to tackle as a next step the compensation to victims by the offender. Once an agreement has been found between Parliament and the Council, we will be able to help and assist the Member States in getting those provisions introduced into national law, and we will support practical projects on the ground that are crucial for ensuring that victims can obtain effective rights in practice. We are going to say loud and clear: ‘we Europeans care about people’ – and support to victims is about caring about people.</p>
      <p sl="en">My thanks to all those people who have managed to help in order to make this legislation become a reality.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, it is a terrible thing that the victim of a crime is in a worse situation than the perpetrator, the criminal. I am therefore very pleased to accept this initiative and I would like to thank both the European Commission and the rapporteurs for their excellent work. The fundamental objective, which is to provide protection to victims of crime throughout the European Union, is indeed a great challenge for our Parliament and for European institutions. This does, of course, tie in with courts and public institutions in Member States also recognising civil protection measures, as this is a process that is based on mutual trust between justice systems.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs, we have been trying, step by step, to enable and facilitate cross-border civil law cooperation to make this increasingly convenient for individual citizens to access. I am very pleased to see progress in our work. However, I must draw your attention to one particularly important issue: if people are to benefit from something, they have to know about it. For this reason, I am again appealing to the Commissioner and to the European Commission via the Commissioner, as well as to the representatives of Member States, to instigate a well thought through information campaign so that people know which protective measures are available to them and so that they feel safer in the united Europe.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, when a criminal act takes place, we immediately begin contemplating the quickest route to track down the responsible individuals in order to bring them to justice, as well as the measures needed in order to prevent the criminal act from repeating itself. These are praiseworthy actions, yet we need to focus more attention on the victims. This is, in fact, what we are doing today, as a result of this law which I happily welcome. Now, we shall no longer distinguish between first or second class victims, determined by country or nationality. From now on, victims will be provided with the same kind of assistance. Everybody stands to gain from this law, because anyone can end up being a victim from one moment to the next. As the Vice-President of the Commission has pointed out, this law represents a significant step in the building of a Europe for the citizens; a Europe which endorses freedom, justice and security; a Europe that offers its citizens top quality rights; a Europe which, above all, does not abandon you at your most vulnerable moment, that is, falling victim to a criminal act. Therefore, I would like to thank Vice-President Reding, as well as the rapporteurs, in particular Teresa Jiménez-Becerril, who I know has this law very much at heart, including on a personal level.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would, of course, like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Ms Parvanova and Ms Jiménez-Becerril, for the work they have done; their effort and dedication have enabled us to carry out difficult negotiations with the Council, making it possible to complete the processing of this extremely important measure for all victims in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We agree with the Commission on the need for a comprehensive legal framework that provides care and protection to victims in the European Union, and therefore covers issues relating to their rights to information, a victim assessment and support services. These are fundamental aspects, and I think they have been properly included in this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to give a special mention to the incorporation in this report of female victims of gender-based violence. For some time now, our group has been pressing the Commission on the need for a European directive to combat gender-based violence against women. We have been given a negative response, and we feel it was important that, at least in this text, a reference should be made to the social scourge of violence towards women.</p>
      <p sl="es">A great deal remains to be done, of course, but this is a step forward and I believe that, with the good will of everyone, we can say that we are now moving forward in the fight for equality and the struggle against the social scourge of gender-based violence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate our two co-rapporteurs on their work. After intense negotiations, which were difficult but exceedingly well organised, they managed to come to an agreement with the EU Council that will allow minimum standards on the protection of victims to be introduced throughout the European Union, marking another stage in the creation of the area of freedom and justice at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given the current situation, it is rare in the Union to find so many reasons to be satisfied. This evening, we can all welcome the mechanism outlined in this text to protect victims, who form a legal category that, as you said, Commissioner, is often forgotten in our national legal systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Justice for victims means protecting them, facilitating their access to justice, supporting them and giving them the right to legitimate compensation. It was therefore essential to have this coordinated, integrated approach that benefits victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome three points in particular. The first is the fact that the Council largely agreed to better protection for children. This text pays particular attention to children and their needs, and to their vulnerability as far as protection is concerned. That is covered by this text, and Article 22 in particular, which enshrines in full the principles and standards advocated by the Council of Europe, and the rights specific to children and their protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, as you pointed out, Commissioner, we need to train practitioners and all those likely to come into contact with victims, including civil servants, lawyers, and those responsible for victim support: Article 24 emphasises the need for general and specialist training, which is a good concrete, realistic step forward at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, it is essential to develop the network of host structures to ensure that all victims can find someone nearby who will listen to and support them. This personalised aid is fundamental in the European Union because these victims are often alone and distraught because of these traumatic situations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, Commissioner, all that remains is to take the necessary measures to inform the public and raise awareness of this new mechanism.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would, first of all, like to thank Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Parvanova, who have joined forces to lay down a new European directive which will really change criminal proceedings in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have had to pay a lot of thought to, and have had to get used to, the idea that our administration of justice is going to change by strengthening the position of victims. But I have got used to this idea and I actually find it appealing. It is crucial for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that, in this new law for victims, we are not going to distinguish between people who have legal status and people who do not. For example, if you are a victim of trafficking and if you find yourself in the European Union without documents, this directive should ensure that you can report to the police and that you will receive guidance in your criminal proceedings. That, as a result of the directive, you can be taken care of, that you have access to an interpreter, that you receive medical care and psychological assistance – we find that crucial.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, this will lead – and this enhanced European cooperation in the field of law is also showing us this – to a shortage of legal aid. This really calls for European rules on legal aid, because getting your rights recognised on paper is something different to being proved right in court. Victims will experience that and suspects are already experiencing it. So this directive is insufficient without minimum standards for legal aid in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last Wednesday, near the beautiful Lake Annecy in south-eastern France, three British adults were shot dead, two young children survived, one is in a critical condition, and the second has been left deeply traumatised by what she witnessed. Within days, British police officers were in France working alongside their French counterparts, and French investigators have travelled to the UK to work alongside the British. This is a very good example of a joint investigation and illustrates that EU Member States can cooperate and work together on the most serious of crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">This directive will create a proper legal framework, so this example of collaboration and cooperation between the French and the British will become the norm, and vulnerable victims can be spared further pain and distress. Whilst this directive covers a wide spectrum of crime from the most petty to the most serious, I believe that when people find themselves away from their home country and are the victim of a violent and serious crime, they are at their most vulnerable, especially children.</p>
      <p sl="en">By asking all European national governments to adhere to a set of standards for all victims, we can ensure that they will receive the proper assistance and support. For the first time in European legislation, there will also be a legal requirement to respond to the particular needs of victims of terrorism, including their immediate family members.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier today, we remembered those who had lost their lives in the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers, and we remember also their family members left behind. Since that attack, Europe, too, has faced the threat of terrorism. When London was attacked in July 2007, 52 innocent people lost their lives and 52 families lost a loved one. The same can be said of our friends in Madrid.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I am pleased to see the inclusion of a large number of amendments initiated by myself relating to child victims. As a lawyer, I dealt with a number of children who had been the victims of crimes, and I know the sensitivity which is required in order to guarantee their safety and protection. In the UK, we have become very well skilled at dealing with children who are victims or witnesses of crime, and I believe that in this specific area, we really can share best practice with other EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the Commission and its staff, as well as to the Council and its staff, for helping to make it possible during this process to negotiate out this final result. I would also like to say a special thank you to Parliament’s rapporteurs, Ms Parvanova and Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, for really working hard and in such a splendid way to make this document mean as much as possible for the victims of crime. You fought for Parliament’s point of view with zeal and enthusiasm. Thank you once again for that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With regard to the proposal itself, I am particularly pleased that it now contains a strong gender perspective. Examples of this include the fact that victims of crime who suffer gender-based violence are highlighted, the need for safe accommodation is established, and the right to legal information is clarified. The directive is therefore a step in the right direction when it comes to combating men’s violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would, however, like to emphasise the fact that Parliament still believes that the Commission should present a proposal for an EU strategy for preventing violence against women. Only within the framework of such a coherent strategy will it be possible to take measures at EU level, effectively and forcefully, to combat all forms of violence against women in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for this work. I welcome this debate tonight and believe that the proposals before us represent real progress in how we deal with the victims of crime in our society.</p>
      <p sl="en">My constituency of Northern Ireland is today making real progress after having suffered at the hands of criminals who, through their terrorist campaign, have sadly left us with many victims who daily feel the hurt and loss of loved ones or deal with mental or physical anguish as a result of what they were put through. These victims, innocents, suffering loss through no fault or deed of their own, need our support and the support of democratic institutions. I am heartened by what I have heard tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is a key point: I would urge the House to always remember to make a clear distinction between the perpetrator of crime and the victim of that crime. There are some in my constituency, perverse as it may seem to the vast majority of us, where the perpetrator can also be the victim. That cannot, and should never, be the case.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year, millions of people in the European Union are victims of crime. According to Eurostat data, there are around 30 million crimes, many of which are unfortunately never reported for fear of reprisals. Often, crimes do not just affect the victim, but also have an indirect impact on family members and relations.</p>
      <p sl="it">Whether people are victims of mugging, theft, burglary, murder, sexual violence or even terrorist attacks, they all have the same need, which is to be treated with respect and dignity. Support, guaranteed protection for one’s physical safety, access to justice and payment of damages are all inalienable rights that every judicial system must guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, Europe is finally proposing to adopt a directive capable of guaranteeing a shared legal framework for the protection of all victims, helping in solid terms to sweep away all the obstacles that continue to prevent effective cross-border protection. The legislative text aims to strengthen people’s trust in judicial systems, by helping to make it possible to apply an existing protection programme in another Member State. The right would also ultimately apply to the victim’s family members.</p>
      <p sl="it">From now on, greater attention will be paid to the professional training of all those working in the judicial system, who will have to gain new skills in psychological and social welfare support. Therefore, there should be an end to unpunished crime, victims without justice or support, and criminals walking free rather than going to prison.</p>
      <p sl="it">The text we will be voting on tomorrow represents a step towards building a model of justice in which the institutions fight to defend citizens’ rights, and ensure that no criminal can walk free as a result of a breakdown in communication between different judicial systems.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must welcome the final result achieved for this text, which aims to ensure that greater consideration is given to the vulnerability of victims, victims who feel, quite rightly, that too often they do not receive sufficient respect and sometimes receive less support than the perpetrators of the crimes themselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have one small reservation, however, because we would all have liked to have gone even further by extending the list of vulnerable victims, but the Council did not agree to this, for financial reasons, which is a complicated topic in this time of economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The principle of an individual interview for each victim remains, and this should prevent any risk of discrimination in victims’ access to the different services. This is a major step forward: it will allow us to better define the rights and needs of victims across Europe and to respond in the most appropriate fashion, taking into account the specific needs of each person and, in particular, women who are the victims of violence.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thanks to this directive, victims across Europe will have greater guarantees that they will be able to take part in legal proceedings without bearing the financial costs, and to overcome language barriers and problems relating to disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="es">There will be more and better training for the people caring for them, and particular care will be provided to victims with special needs, such as victims of gender-based violence, children and victims of organised crime and terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteurs for all their work. However, I would like to stress some of the key points which are crucial for our group.</p>
      <p sl="en">Gender-based violence, as well as violence in close relationships, is defined for the first time in EU legislation. This is a huge success given that Commissioner Reding’s proposal was – I am sorry to say – gender-blind in the beginning. In fact, the seriousness of gender-based violence was denied as was the request for a separate directive on gender-based violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also managed to highlight and include reference to victims of race and hate crimes or abuse. Another success were the proposals with regard to victims’ access to support and protection without discrimination of any kind, including their residence status, and regardless of the participation of victims in criminal proceedings, which were adopted by the rapporteurs and the Commission and were thus accepted by Council as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that irregular migrants who are victims of crimes will have access to the rights, support and protection afforded by the directive regardless of whether the victim makes a formal complaint of a criminal offence.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I consider the adoption of the directive to be an important matter. I welcome the fact that it ensures minimum rules for all crime victims who are EU citizens, regardless of their nationality or of the place where the crime took place.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I particularly welcome, for example, the fact that the directive gives both victims and their families the right to all the information on their case and the state of proceedings in their mother tongue, that victims should be provided with support services such as accommodation, medical care, psychological and legal advice, and that this directive is to ensure protection of the privacy of victims, thus attempting to avoid repeat victimisation. This is particularly important for victims with specific needs, and above all children – who must be given special care during proceedings – or victims of sexual or domestic violence. In all cases of this kind, it is highly necessary to limit contact between the victim and the perpetrator.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In conclusion, I would like to say only that the actual method of applying these rules in the Member States is important, because an act of legislation is just the beginning. However, I would like to thank all parties involved for this act of legislation.</p>

I was honoured to accompany Maggie Hughes to her office.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner put Ms Hughes at the heart of her speech because it was her campaigning which formed many of the amendments which we put forward to this directive. Those amendments really informed what constructed a victim’s agenda to this report and it answered the question: how does the EU help me and my family in times of dire need, where existing cooperation between Member States has demonstrably been inadequate?</p>

This directive will reinforce a series of measures implemented at European level to promote the free movement and the defence of victims of crime, such as the European protection order.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow we will vote on a directive which will finally introduce minimum European standards in respect of rights, support and protection for all victims of crime.</p>
      <p sl="cs">With regard to the cross-border dimension of crime, it is important that the directive introduces the same rules for all victims, regardless of their status, such as the right to translation and interpretation, and that it secures access to legal aid.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Among the other beneficial aspects, I would include the greater protection in particular for at-risk groups of victims, such as children and women, and also the fact that the media will be forbidden from contributing to the further victimisation of victims by revealing their identity. I appreciate the fact that states will have to commit to providing training for judges and prosecutors, and also to financing information campaigns and submitting statistical information for evaluating the success of the directive in the future.</p>
      <p sl="cs">However, I am not the only one who, over and above the framework of the minimum levels of this directive, also expects states to provide victims with additional help, making things easier for them in a difficult situation, and to help them avoid or minimise post-traumatic complications by providing further services, such as payment-free psychological assistance.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The directive also shows, however, that Europeans respect human dignity, ladies and gentlemen, and that they do so under all circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the directive we are debating today complements the European protection order we have already adopted – although we do not yet have a regulation, as you are aware, Commissioner Reding – which was presented by Spain and other Member States during the Spanish Presidency. The best protection is to ensure that crime does not exist. However, given that prevention is often difficult, very difficult or almost impossible, it is our obligation to provide victims with the means to overcome their tragedies. For that, I pay tribute to the rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Emotional and psychological support is therefore important, even if the victim has not reported the crime, precisely to make it possible for them to do so. It is also important for the directive to highlight the fact that Member States should guarantee compensation for victims. In the case of gender-based violence, this reference to compensation is crucial as a deterrent and restorative measure.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, this directive will not be worth the paper it is written on, Commissioner Reding, if the Commission does not consider supporting Member States in the EU programmes that have funded this preferential line of action. As part of the multiannual financial framework for 2013-2020, programmes in the area of justice have been restructured, supposedly with the aim of rationalising and simplifying them, but the general section on rights and citizenship is very broad and makes no mention of victims.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner Reding, Recital 25 talks about encouraging non-governmental organisations to make a commitment to defending victims, and Article 7 mentions specialist services. We have to make these measures available in Europe and make reference to victims.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner Reding, I call on you to make a commitment to maintaining the Daphne Programme, in order to allay the concerns of those who have worked to lessen the scale of this issue, and so that we can really help this directive enter into force.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be no exception in congratulating our rapporteurs, and indeed our Commissioner, very warmly. As a lawyer myself, I see much in this package to admire, and much that is not only necessary but very urgent.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we need to move on to what comes next. While we congratulate ourselves and recognise the progress that has been made and celebrate the fact that we have got this far, the 2001 package promised much but raised – and dashed – the hopes of those of us who wanted to see a more coherent system. It is crucial that we learn the lessons of that to make sure that they are not repeated.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy to report that the Scottish Government is a very willing partner in this process. The Scottish Government this week launched a Victims and Witness Bill to the Scottish Parliament which will exceed the terms of this directive by a significant margin. We are keen on this legislation. We will work with you.</p>
      <p sl="en">Scots law already is very distinctive within our European tradition. But what about the other Member States? We have a three-year limit for transposition. Will the Commissioner tonight undertake to open immediate infraction proceedings if a Member State drags its feet, for whatever reason? We need a civil body on the side of victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">To finish with one sentence: we need to see a proper budget for it. Commissioner, we will work with you on this dossier going forward to deliver for our citizens. Passing laws is easy; enforcing them is what will change their lives.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, after tomorrow’s vote, the Community justice system will be supplemented by a practical directive which will have tangible effects for EU citizens as well, and on the basis of which victims, and also their family members, can finally receive sufficient attention and support, and measures related to them can perhaps finally be harmonised at EU level. Praise for this substantial work goes to Commissioner Reding, Ms Parvanova and, in particular, Ms Jiménez-Becerril for her dedication. They deserve this praise especially for managing to make it one of the strengths of the report that it pays special attention to child victims and to the particular situation of victims in general.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am particularly pleased that through the adoption of the Budapest Road map with a view to ensuring the protection of victims, the Hungarian Presidency also played a significant part in this. This directive will only be successful if it is transposed as soon as possible at Member State level, if sufficient financial funds can be allocated to its implementation, if appropriate experts are available, and if we can finally develop an approach that is sympathetic to the situation of victims. This directive can help bolster citizens’ faith in national justice and its European enforcement.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Blue-card question. – I have two questions. Firstly, does this pride of the so-called Budapest Road map in respect of the victims of crime mean that we can finally expect the Hungarian Government to take decisive action against mass criminality, especially in Eastern Hungary? Secondly, does my Hungarian fellow Member’s particular respect for child victims mean that the civic government will finally take firm and serious action to ensure the extradition of the Irish car driver who ran over two children in Hungary, and to make sure that he serves his sentence? In addition, we should not just praise the Commissioner, but also criticise her whenever necessary.</p>

Still, what I can tell you about all that is happening is that the Hungarian Government and the police are, in my opinion, doing everything in their power to ensure that citizens can enjoy peace and security throughout Hungary. On the other hand, as far as I know, it was actually the Hungarian Minister for Justice who held talks with the Commissioner in early summer to make sure that we can finally see progress in the Tobin case – everyone considers this case an unfortunate affair.</p>

      <p sl="it">I believe that, after the directives concerning human trafficking, child pornography and the European protection order, it is very important to focus on vulnerable people using a holistic approach with this directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is very important for all the countries to decide on a shared basis of inalienable rights, starting with the right to understand and be understood in one’s own language, access to services, information, compensation, and basically to justice for oneself and one’s family. It is also important that, thanks to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, reference is made in this directive to the specific nature of violence against minors and women.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope that in this regard, major efforts will be made to inform and update magistrates and lawyers, and I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is important to ensure that we prevent the secondary form of victimisation that often takes place via media that is not self-regulated, which broadcasts pictures of minors, exposing them to further violence and violating their privacy.</p>

I am referring, in particular, to the most vulnerable victims, the victims of gender violence, and especially minors who are victims of crime, who often suffer what is known as ‘repeat victimisation’.</p>
      <p sl="it">This directive will give greater power and effectiveness to other measures such as, for example, the directive on the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography on the Internet, for which I was the rapporteur for Parliament, which endorsed the absolute need for support and protection for minors who are victims of sexual abuse. Therefore, this new directive completes a process of justice and law that will strengthen the value of citizenship.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, stories from the lives of our citizens often convince us that, as a result of the different cultural traditions and different historical development of the judicial and security structures in the EU Member States, there are large differences in the exercising of civil rights between the Member States. The same is true in the protection and guaranteeing of the rights of victims of crime.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The efforts of the European Commission to establish minimum standards for the rights of crime victims are therefore justified. In addition to recognising the rights of victims to information, interpreting and translation, and to have access to legal protection and victim support services, I think it is very important to assert the right of victims to avoid contact with the perpetrator.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, the recognition of those rights in the legal acts of the EU does not, in itself, automatically change the status of victims in everyday life. All bodies working in law enforcement, police officers, prosecutors and the judicial authorities will have to adopt working methods according to these principles. It is therefore very important to be aware that our work will not end with the adoption of this act.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, when we talk about victims, we need to think primarily about those groups which encounter difficulties when it comes to demanding their rights. I am referring to minors, regardless of whether they are direct or indirect victims, to the elderly and to people with disabilities. I am also thinking about women’s rights and the victims of sexual abuse.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital to establish standard rules for protecting victims. It is important to ensure that they are involved in judicial proceedings. Member States must provide information about the way and the conditions under which victims can access compensation. I also think that they must be able to access translation and interpretation services as a basic right.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as is often the case, here we are talking about and discussing some of the most important aspects of our European policy in a relatively empty Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not know whether you realise, honourable Members present here tonight, that you are witnessing history, because tonight we have broken down a wall: the wall of indifference to the people who need us, as politicians, the most. I am not about to make a tear-jerking speech but what I will say is that in years to come, this day will be etched in our minds as the starting point of a new policy of the European Union, a policy focused on citizens, focused on human beings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should particularly like to thank the two rapporteurs, who have done a wonderful job and who have worked hard for the future of European citizens in their area of justice. Congratulations! A heartfelt thank you to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This directive is about minimum rights for victims, so Member States can, of course, go a step further if they wish. But those Member States who have no such provisions must guarantee the human beings of Europe – and by human beings of Europe I mean not only the citizens of Europe, but also all people, regardless of their residence status, who happen to be in Europe – a minimum basis to address the very specific needs they have as victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We now have to ensure that all Member States implement these provisions. As I said in my introduction, the Commission, with its experts, will help Member States to do this. Once they have been implemented, the Commission, as always, will be responsible, as guardian of the Treaty, for the proper enforcement of the directive in real terms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That also means that we need to provide training for the police and justice practitioners, as well as awareness raising, to ensure that victims know their rights. We will also require the help of the victims’ organisations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Such initiatives are today financed from different programmes, including the Daphne Programme. In future, they will be financed under the justice and citizens’ rights programmes. I thank the European Parliament today for all the efforts it will make to help ensure that the Council does not reduce financing in these domains.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all agree that this is a first step, but it is a very important step because we have broken through this wall of indifference. We have opened the way so that the next steps can be taken.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I am pleased to note that the Community directive we are about to adopt, which regulates the fundamental rights of victims at EU level, specifically provides for the protection of the victims of hate crime and crimes committed with a discriminatory motive. I also find it particularly important that the draft legislation urges support to the vulnerable groups of society that are especially threatened by crime. The poor, members of minorities and the homeless are frequent targets of violence. Crimes against women and children and incidents of domestic violence are also commonplace; contrary to some opinions, these are not caused by low birth rates but by the spreading of aggression. Many do not file police reports out of ignorance or fear. It is essential for the victims to know their rights. We need information and awareness-raising campaigns, for which Community funds are available. Several Member States are using EU support to implement programmes that provide legal information and even aid to the victims of crime. These should be continued and, wherever possible, expanded. It is important for law enforcement and justice staff to be aware of the tasks and responsibilities associated with the protection of victims. The directive to be adopted calls attention to this need. The draft legislation lays down the minimum requirements for the protection of victims; I hope that in practice, some Member States will afford the victims of crime broader rights and protection.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs of this very important report reinforcing the need to adopt a comprehensive European legal framework offering all victims of crime the widest protection within the territory of the EU. This framework must follow a victim-centred approach – meaning that all categories of potential victims must be identified, targeted and protected, with special attention to children and other groups at risk – and must also cover related policies of social affairs and social inclusion, as well as effective methods for the social rehabilitation of victims, including measures related to social security systems and the labour market. Specific measures are necessary in order to prevent extortion and retaliation under the full assurance of anonymity, paying special attention to the situation of victims with specific needs. Awareness-raising campaigns must be organised involving civil and non-governmental organisations, women’s organisations and the media, and it is also necessary to conduct detailed researches on the latest criminal trends, with special focus on the involvement of at-risk groups, analysing all the factors that lead to the victimisation of such groups.</p>

      <p sl="fi">This week, the European Parliament adopted an important law safeguarding the fundamental rights of Europeans. It provides minimum protection for all victims of crime. The new act is significant, not just for EU citizens who are travelling, but also for those who are very vulnerable, for whom the law offers special protection. The act stresses the importance of protecting privacy in the case of children and, for example, the media will be prohibited from using images of victims. On the other hand, women who have suffered violence will be protected through a restriction on contact between the victim and the perpetrator. I am very pleased that concrete measures are being introduced in the European Union to safeguard fundamental rights. The European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights that entered into force two years or so ago safeguards the rights of citizens to the extent that EU law is applied, but it has not yet succeeded in safeguarding fundamental rights externally. The Equal Treatment Directive prohibiting all kinds of discrimination, which is in preparation, would provide good resources for that, but some Member States are opposed to its entry into force on account of the costs that might be incurred. The adoption of this directive would be an important next step towards an EU where everyone’s fundamental civic rights are protected.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to emphasise again today just how important it is for the victims of a wide range of crimes to receive appropriate protection and support during criminal proceedings, and for them to be treated with respect and dignity. It is no less important that they should be able to count on redress, justice and protection against the crimes being repeated, irrespective of the Member State where the crime took place, and whether or not the victim of the crime is a citizen of that country. All of this has been guaranteed in the directive on which the European Parliament will be voting tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The directive contains some clauses that are worthy of particular note: the introduction of a unified definition of ‘victim’, under which the status of victim is accorded not only to the people directly affected, but also to close family members; a definition of victims of ‘gender-based violence’ and ‘violence in close relationship’; the introduction of the solutions that are necessary to ensure effective coordination between authorities that provide support to victims through the creation of both formal and informal structures enabling the staff of courts, prosecution services and non-governmental organisations to work in a regulated manner and to ensure that victims have access to psychological counselling, legal assistance and translation and interpreting services free of charge. There is no doubt that this is a very important step towards harmonising law on a European level and it is, above all, an expression of real concern for citizens throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report on establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime is an expression by the European Parliament that is very important and that has long been awaited by citizens of the European Union. The objectives of the directive are to strengthen the rights of victims in the EU and for the mutual recognition of protection measures in court proceedings. All victims of crime, irrespective of their legal status, should be accorded the widest protection throughout the whole of the European Union. For this reason, we should establish minimum protection standards in the whole of the EU that grant rights to all victims of crime irrespective of their nationality or the location of the crime. The person affected by the crime (understood here as the victim of the crime) should be guaranteed the right to information, translation and interpreting services, legal assistance and victim support services, as well as the right to be heard. The clause in the directive that provides protection to victims who do not wish to have contact with perpetrators deserves support. Victims and, this is also important, their family members, particularly children, should be offered support, including psychological counselling, free of charge from the time that they are affected by the crime.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is required in order to introduce these changes is a consolidated definition of ‘victim’ that is the same in all the legal systems in EU Member States, and this should recognise that a ‘victim’ is not just the person directly affected by the perpetrator but also their family members. The European Union should introduce a transparent justice system that includes these suggestions as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission even showed us a copy of a letter from a French cane refiner telling it that cane supplies were chronically inadequate, whilst at the same time stating that the system should remain as it is. What the Commission failed to mention, or notice, was that the refinery was owned by a beet producer, thus their desire to keep the status quo.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the Commission admits there is a problem, we are told that it is only a British problem, yet 62 MEPs from 11 Member States wrote to the Agriculture Commissioner asking for changes to be made to the sugar regime. Jobs are at risk, not only in the UK, but across Europe, especially in Portugal, Bulgaria and Romania. The Commission knows there is a problem; we know there is a problem. We must act now to create a level playing field in this industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you are not responsible for agriculture but for citizenship. It is our job to protect our citizens, those whose jobs are under threat and those who are paying more at the supermarket each week. The price of sugar in the EU is 46% more than in the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">All the Commission needs to do is to look at the source of the sugar supply and fix it. If the Commission refuses to do that now, it will have let down the very people it is here to serve, and Europe will lose a key manufacturing industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with due respect to the Commissioner, I would have hoped that the Agricultural Commissioner might have been here tonight to answer our questions but I am sure the Commissioner here will do a very good job in trying to reply.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our debate tonight is focused on the Commission’s management of the EU sugar market regime following the reforms of 2006. According to our cane refiners, and Tate &amp; Lyle in particular, they claim that the Commission forecast in 2006 of 3.5 million tonnes of cane imports to the EU from the ACP countries has failed to materialise, and the Commission so far has refused to allow in enough tariff-free imports from other countries, such as Brazil, to make up the difference.</p>
      <p sl="en">They claim this has led to rocketing raw material costs and reduced throughput in their factories by up to 40%, which is driving up costs and making them uncompetitive against beet producers in the EU market. They argue that unless the Commission takes action to allow more raw material into the EU market, sugar refiners are going to close and jobs in many EU countries will be lost. They say all they want is fair competition and a level playing field, and it is the Commission’s actions that are preventing that from happening.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have the counter-arguments from the beet growers, who claim the market is balanced, and that the Commission forecast of 3.5 million tonnes of imports has materialised, as it includes both raw and white sugar, and the EU must not allow imports of cane from Brazil as it would undermine the preferred suppliers in the ACP countries. They also claim that it is the failure of the cane sector to reconstruct and rationalise after the 2006 reform that is the real root cause of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the question is: who is right and what action needs to be taken? There is no doubt in my mind that there is a real problem in the cane sector and I want to hear from the Commissioner here tonight what action she is going to take to ensure there is a level playing field for both beet and cane processors.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development for the openness and availability for dialogue that he has been displaying to date in response to the many initiatives that we in Parliament have been conducting in this regard. However, Commissioner, dialogue is not enough if it does not produce results, which have been lacking up to now, unfortunately. Is it or is not true, Commissioner, that Europe’s sugar refineries have found it harder and harder to access the raw materials for processing since the reform of the sugar sector in 2006? Is it or is it not true that the forecasts made in 2005 for supply to the industry were overestimated and are far from being realised, despite the conclusion of new trade agreements with other countries?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Obviously, I can accept any argument aimed at defending European producers, but that is exactly what this is about. In some European countries, such as mine, Portugal, we have industry and jobs totally dependent on access, under reasonable conditions, to cane sugar for refining. This is not a situation that we can analyse coldly and say to industry that this is merely a problem of the market that should be resolved by it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We all know that economic operators make decisions on the basis of what the European regulator announces and forecasts. It is also true that, in this case, the Commission’s forecasts were far from accurate. I therefore call on the Commission to make the necessary decisions, ensuring balanced operations between sectors that supply the European sugar market. This is also with a view to ensuring that the 4 500 jobs in Europe’s sugar-refining industry, which are so important in these times of economic and financial crisis, are not lost.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, the essence of the problem is that the European Union, as a result of the sugar production reform, has turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer. Many experts and producers believe the reason for that is largely the implemented quota system, which led to the closing of many sugar factories – including all three sugar factories in my country, Latvia.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Farmers and sugar producers are demanding that sugar production be restored in Latvia, but the quota system does not allow it. Elimination of the quota system is demanded also by the Coalition of Industrial Sugar Users in Germany in a letter addressed to me, adding that new and complex methods are not necessary for regulation of the sugar market, but rather that the sugar quotas should be lifted.</p>
      <p sl="lv">By implementing quotas, sugar production in Europe was reduced to 80% of the necessary amount. It is stated in Article 60 of the Council’s CAP that the quota system must be maintained until 2020, and it is planned to regulate the amount of sugar with lower prices, but that is not realistic, as the costs per hectare are almost the same whether the sugar beet harvest is rich or poor. Extension of the quota periods will continue making the planning of procurement more difficult for industrial sugar users, increase consumer prices, as well as create obstacles to competitiveness in the global market. Such policy entails poor growth opportunities for the industry.</p>
      <p sl="lv">In my opinion, regional production should be preserved, and additionally the production of sugar that will compete in the global market beyond the European Union should be allowed. That would solve many problems.</p>

    <intervention id="2-748-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will try to answer parliamentary questions on behalf of my colleague, Mr Cioloş.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You will be aware that the reform of the common market organisation for sugar (CMO) dates back to November 2005, and that the aim of this reform was to increase the competitiveness of the EU sugar sector. The sugar beet sector suffered with the closure of many factories while, at the same time, the refined cane sugar sector was given a budget of EUR 150 million to enable it to become more competitive. This reform also abolished the difference between traditional refiners and sugar refiners, with a transitional period of three years ending in 2009. Meanwhile, the European Union granted duty-free access to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) and ‘Everything but Arms’ (EBA) countries, but with a safeguard clause set to be triggered when imports exceeded 3.5 million tonnes, which includes 1.6 million tonnes for ACP countries which were not least developed countries (LDC). In 2005, a World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel restricted exports to 1.35 million tonnes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following the sugar reform, the sugar quota fell to the level of 13.3 million tonnes compared to a sugar quota of 17.4 million tonnes in 2004-2005. As a result, 41% of factories were closed. Meanwhile, refining capacities increased by more than 1.5 million tonnes in the European Union of 27 and so-called ‘traditional’ refiners decided to increase their capacity to 1.15 million tonnes over the past five years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Current imports are based on preferential agreements with the ACP countries and the least developed countries to the tune of 1.8 million tonnes this year, which, with 670 000 tonnes from Brazil, 380 000 tonnes from the Balkans and 400 000 tonnes from reduced-rate auctions, give a total of 3.2 million tonnes for the current year. For the next year, quotas of nearly 300 000 tonnes have been allocated to Central and South America and 400 000 tonnes of sugar are imported annually in the form of processed products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">2009-2010 was not a typical year. World prices were higher than prices in the European Union, which had not been seen for 50 years. ACP countries therefore preferred to sell their domestic goods on the world market or on the domestic market, and they did not deliver the quantities specified for the European Union. Market balance in the EU was under threat for our consumers. The 2005 reform clearly states that it is only in this instance that the Commission is allowed to take action. To balance the market, the Commission has authorised imports during 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 under preferential conditions and at discounts on the EU quota-free sugar market. This action is balanced, both in terms of volume and conditions. In total, 2.35 million tonnes of extra sugar were placed on the EU market, 1.25 million tonnes of which were imports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that some refiners are complaining about not enough sugar being available, and some of you are also raising this issue. What is it about then?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first thing to point out is that this view is not universally shared by European refiners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second thing is: what do the import figures tell us? Before the 2005 reform, imports stood at 2.3 million tonnes. Since the reform, they have risen. To say then that there is less imported sugar and that this is why some companies are having problems bears no relation to reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is the real problem, then? A more detailed analysis of the situation for each Member State and for each refining company shows that the refining industry in Europe has entered the market economy and has been opened to competition, as was intended by the 2005 reform. Competition between refiners is now a reality. Some Member States and some refiners have increased their refining capacity by securing their supplies from third countries. For other refiners, we see that supply volumes have dropped off since the reform, while total European imports have grown. It is therefore simply a problem of private enterprise business strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the European refining sector entered the market economy as a result of the 2005 reform, after a transition period that ended in 2009. This market-oriented approach was what was wanted and there is no turning back for us now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission’s job is to balance the EU sugar market. Sugar imports have risen dramatically since 2006. They reached a historical high of 4 million tonnes in 2011. Imports from ACP countries have also followed this trend. If ACP countries decide to export to the EU sugar refined by them, not only must we accept it; we must also acknowledge that it contributes to the development of their economies. The difficulties reported by a small number of refining companies have nothing to do with a shortage of sugar. They are to do with greater competition between European refiners, with a sharp increase in the production capacity of refiners. This explains why some plants are not operating at full capacity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main objective of the sugar reform was to increase competitiveness, on a sustainable basis, and the market-oriented approach of the EU sugar industry. The EU has become a net importer of sugar, whereas before it was a key net exporter. This reform has therefore been successful as it has done away with structural surplus production of sugar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The current sugar market regime is valid until 30 September 2015. In October 2011, the Commission presented its proposal for the future functioning of the sugar regime in the European Union, which provides for the abolition of production quotas. This is currently under discussion with the European Parliament and other European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On behalf of Mr Cioloş, I would urge you to take an active part in this debate on the CAP post-2013 and the future of the quota system.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, a secure supply of sugar for the European market must be the top priority of European sugar policy. The reform of the sugar regime in 2006 made the European Union dependent on imports, at least in part. Ms Reding has just mentioned the figures. The result of the reform is that imports amounting to 15% of consumption are now needed on a permanent basis. However, after the imports fell below expected levels because of poor harvests in some important sugar producing countries and the resulting rise in world market prices, the Commission has, in my opinion, taken the right measures. It has made importing additional amounts of sugar easier. More than 500 000 tonnes have been imported without duty being paid. It has also enabled domestic producers of sugar and isoglucose to sell part of their non-quota production on the food market. The amount in this case is also 500 000 tonnes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this background, it is clear that the Commission has achieved the balance referred to in the questions. I very much support what Ms Reding has said in this respect. The sugar market regime has the necessary instruments to secure the supply and to guarantee a fair balance across the different interests. The risk of redundancies has been mentioned, in particular, by the first speaker, and I would like to refer to what Mr Tarabella said. Thousands of jobs were lost during the reform of the sugar regime. In my constituency in the Upper Palatinate area of Germany, one of the oldest sugar refineries in Europe was closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Our goal must not be to ensure that every single job is secure, despite the fact that I regret every redundancy. Instead, we must ensure that there is a balance. I believe it will be good for the sugar regime reform to be extended until 2020.</p>

Do you accept that EU sugar prices are, in fact, 46% higher than the world price, having risen nearly 50% since the Commission first recognised the EU sugar crisis in December 2010? EU sugar prices are rising while world prices are actually falling, so it is not a problem of high world prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, do you accept that there has been a perverse incentive for beet processors to bid up the price of raw cane sugar, forcing traditional refiners out of business while rapidly increasing the profits on their sugar beet sales by pushing white sugar prices higher?

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Thank you, Ms Ludford. In the past, we had excessively high sugar prices in Europe. During the reform of the sugar regime in 2006 and also beforehand, sugar beet prices in Europe fell by around 40%. This meant that sugar beet producers suffered massive cuts. There have been major fluctuations in prices on the world market. There was a time when sugar was much more expensive on the world market than in Germany. At that point, none of the African, Caribbean and Pacific states were supplying Europe. The problem was that there were inconsistencies. Ms Ludford, if we in Europe abolish the sugar regime, we will be even more exposed to fluctuations in prices and European consumers will have to pay a bitter price.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I have already had the opportunity to speak using my blue card, so I am surprised at the wording of the question. I think that it has been dictated by certain private interests of the big refiners, and I cannot condone this wording or this accusation put to the Commission. Ms Reding gave us a very good explanation of how the Commission wanted to ensure an adequate supply of sugar to consumers. It has managed to maintain this balance by monitoring the market and acting promptly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the future, I advocate quota adjustments. Creating new jobs is, of course, possible – because this, I would say, is a concern that we all have – and could be done by adjusting quotas upwards in response to the market. But more importantly, I think it would be helpful, in future, to try to control production collectively because, as we know, whatever the production may be, a lack of production control leads to spiralling costs, with erratic prices, which are the scourge of farmers. And, for sugar, as with other materials, it is essential that production is controlled to respond to the market. In any case, I hope that in the future, these quotas will be adjusted in line with market realities in order to help revive European industry and European producers that little bit more.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, the last reform of the sugar regime was a very positive development and the industry adapted to the market as a result.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the complaints from all sides show that we need to go further and that we must continue to develop the sugar market, because the Commission’s forecasts were not accurate. The African, Caribbean and Pacific States have not been supplying Europe with sugar. Instead, they have sold it to other countries, because markets all over the world have changed. They have undergone huge changes in recent years, but not in the way that was predicted. Demand has grown in many third countries and we were not able to foresee this. This means that demand for sugar has increased all over the world and, therefore, that there have been reductions in supplies to the European market.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problem is that sugar is not the only product of the agricultural industry, and so farmers have also had to adapt increasingly to the requirements of the market. They are considering alternative crops. For example, in my area of Germany, energy crops are being cultivated and they are genuine competitors for sugar beet.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the course of the market reform, we should discuss whether it is time to abolish the quota regulations that apply to the sugar market and to give it more freedom in future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the hour may be late but quite clearly we have a very good debate going here in this House tonight by a small number of people, which shows you the importance of this topic. I think it is a very timely debate and I congratulate my colleagues on bringing this to the floor of the House.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the success of the reform of the sugar regime, I think the introduction of quotas back in 2006 has been proved very wrong. The processing plants were closed down across Europe. We are now in a situation where we are a net importer of sugar, as has been pointed out here tonight, and that surely, in my opinion, is totally unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also address the issue of equality between different types of sugar production; for example, the sugar cane refining industry is struggling at the moment to access adequate raw materials due to restrictions, no matter what we say. Who can supply the industry in view of the punitive tariffs that are being experienced at the moment? I would urge the Commission to find a solution to the problem, which is putting many jobs at risk throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have to compare what the Commission is saying about their wider policy aims on employment, social living conditions and trade, and what they are saying about sugar.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recently, both President Barroso of the Commission and President Van Rompuy spoke at the Jobs for Europe conference. Each acknowledged the extreme seriousness of unemployment in EU Member States. However, I would wager a bag of sugar that neither of them mentioned the fact that Iceland, Norway and Switzerland have higher employment rates than any EU state, even the mighty Germany. This little booklet tells you all about it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Their words about employment are not matched by their actions, one of which is to raise tariffs against imported raw sugar cane for which there is a ready market. This restriction of supply is a direct cause of lost jobs in the sugar cane refining sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">What twists the knife here is that these tariffs are based on hopelessly inaccurate sugar forecasts made by the Commission in 2005. If the Commission wished to keep food affordable and to keep individuals out of poverty, why enforce a policy that will make sugar more expensive?</p>
      <p sl="en">There is another Commissioner who also has been caught with his fingers in the sugar bowl. This is Mr De Gucht. He recently enthused about the importance of deepening the EU’s trade with third countries. He informed us that this had the potential to increase the GDP of the EU by the equivalent output of a country the size of Denmark or Austria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Restricting sugar imports from overseas countries does seem a strange way to increase trade with them. The Commission’s favourite response when confronted like this is to point to the bilateral trade negotiations that they are conducting with countries in Central America, and assuming that the sugar trade that results from this deal will compensate for the shortfall from the ACP and the less-developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, 300 000 tonnes of new sugar can never replace 1.5 million lost tonnes of traditional sugar and the sooner the Commission faces up to this, the better for all concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our UK House of Lords highlighted this very point last week in their enquiry into the EU sugar regime. The fact that they should even deem such an inquiry necessary should ring alarm bells, and I hope that their very critical conclusion will force the Commissioners to wake up and smell the cane.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the last reform of the sugar sector wrecked Portugal’s sugar beet production sector. After major investment that ensured provision of a significant proportion of national sugar consumption, the country has become almost entirely dependent on imports of cane sugar, and is subject to the availability and price constraints of the international market in this raw material. The effects have been very visible in recent campaigns. Under these new conditions, investments made by a number of refinery-owning companies have now run into problems with a lack of the raw material, which compromises their ability to work at full capacity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission is partly responsible for this situation and cannot ignore or obscure that fact. The auctions of import licences did not meet the refineries’ needs. In this context, it is essential to reinstate quotas, so as to secure each country’s right to restore its sugar beet production capacity and then step it up to its full potential. Meanwhile, however, in the short term, we also need to resolve the shortfall in imports of cane sugar under conditions that enable refineries to go back to full capacity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the 2006 reform was supposed to improve the competitiveness of the sugar beet sector in Europe. This reform was carried out at great sacrifice in terms of men and land. Factories were closed. Whole areas of land had to abandon beet production. Cane sugar refiners are now calling for the suspension of tariffs on sugar without any trade negotiation. Increased imports of cane sugar from other third countries would undermine the preferences granted to our traditional partners in developing countries and could halt investments in these countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union sugar market is totally open. As far as I am concerned, any delay in investments in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the least developed countries (LDCs) cannot justify the refiners’ demand to disregard them. As a rapporteur for this House on the common market organisation (CMO) in the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the ACP countries that I have encountered have explicitly asked me to keep the system in place today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this House has already, on a number of occasions, had discussions, regarding, in particular, the Dess report in July 2011 and Resolution No 2010/2110, passed in March 2011. Yes, we must defend jobs. However, under the pretext of defending dozens of industrial jobs, do we need to have more people abandoning our lands with the removal of European producers? For three years now, is it not the case that our Parliament has, all too often, affirmed and reaffirmed its determination to defend our food self-sufficiency and to promote our agriculture as much as possible?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Vice-President Reding is not the only person present who rarely ventures into agriculture. The 2006 reform promised to guarantee supplies, and has clearly not delivered for traditional cane refiners. The sector is shedding jobs. I would like to say to Mr Dantin that nearly 1 000 jobs are imperilled in my constituency alone, and factories face the risk of closure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meanwhile, beet refiners pocketed EUR 5 billion of aid in 2006 – compared to EUR 150 million for cane refiners – and use a cross subsidy to muscle into refining. They are now creaming off profits since the market is oligopolistic rather than competitive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Raw cane supply has failed to rise, not because preferential suppliers sold elsewhere, but because they did not expand as expected. Some blame should be attached to the Commission’s bureaucracy for its lack of efficiency in administering aid. Meanwhile, imports from Brazil or Thailand face big tariffs: normally EUR 339, and an average of EUR 183 even under special measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The treatment of traditional cane refiners is deeply unfair, and it is workers and consumers who are suffering. Frankly, the Agriculture Commissioner seems prejudiced, stubbornly prejudiced, against them all.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, current policy on regulating the sugar market in Europe has been a disaster. We pay much more for sugar than we did a few years ago. Production in some European Union Member States has been destroyed. Poland provides a clear example of this. Cultivation of sugar beet has been totally discontinued in certain areas that were traditional producers, for example, in the Kazimierz District in the Świętokrzyskie Region. One could describe this as the destruction of this agricultural sector. This has increased unemployment in these areas and, instead of being an exporter, Poland now has to import over 300 000 tonnes of sugar per annum. Production has fallen by 600 000 tonnes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The present proposals from the Commission go in the opposite direction. Immediate market liberalisation is now being proposed. I would therefore ask: does the Commission not see that the effect of this could be to strengthen the position of market leaders while totally destroying small-scale producers? Would it not be sensible to abandon the present system in a gradual manner in order to avoid creating another shock in the market? Finally, would increasing present limits not be a better solution than immediate liberalisation?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, in this debate on the sugar sector, I should like to draw your attention to the particular situation of the outermost regions, which, as you know, would have been hit hard by the 2005 reform had it not been for the introduction of a compensation scheme at national level. As you know, the cane sugar industries in these islands are particularly vulnerable and should be sheltered from the devastating effects that could be generated by the post-2013 reform and alignment with the rules required by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I call on Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Commission to bear in mind the particular situation of the outermost regions. In Réunion Island, there were 13 sugar factories before 1950; just two are left now.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the problem with the sugar sector is much broader than the topics raised by the questions asked during today’s debate, and are not limited to cane sugar. Romania, for instance, provides just 20% of its consumption requirements from its own resources, which means beet grown and processed in the country, with production being limited by the quota system. The remaining 80% consumed is supplied by refining imported raw sugar or directly by importing white sugar.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In recent years, refineries in Romania, and other countries for that matter, have experienced major problems in terms of the supply of raw materials needed and of continuing to operate on the market. The imports of raw materials are strictly limited to certain sources, and only a small quantity can be purchased from efficient sources which can ensure a continuous supply. The Commission has been unable so far to come up with reliable proposals for ensuring that refineries are supplied in the medium and long term and allowing a minimum amount of planning for this activity. As a result, refineries are operating at only 60% of their capacity. Against this backdrop of underuse, refineries are inevitably ending up having to shut down.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We expect measures aimed at removing the restrictions on supplying raw materials caused by tariff and non-tariff barriers. These measures are needed as a matter of urgency if the EU wishes to continue with its own refining industry. Otherwise, we will continue with imports.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, of course, the best thing would be to have no regime for sugar beet. You know yourself that all quota regulations give rise to wastage. However, I accept the opinion of the majority in committee which is that we still cannot really trust the prices and the developments on the world market. Therefore, we will vote in favour of extending the quota regulations for sugar beet in committee. That is the right decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">From my perspective, that brings us to the next point. If we recognise that there are three cornerstones of sugar production – firstly, and most importantly, sugar beet, and then isoglucose and finally imported sugar – then we in committee can, of course, together with the Commission, begin to deal with the question of imported sugar. This could be a solution for everyone which would help to ensure a certain amount of stability in this sector. However, I would like to reiterate that, of course, the best thing would be if we could get rid of quota regulations altogether, but we must extend them in the interests of our farmers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the fact that sugar was in short supply in some Member States and that its price rose out of all proportion due to international speculation permits us to conclude that the reform of sugar quotas in 2006 was a failure of European agricultural policy. The drop in sugar production meant that, in my country, all sugar refineries closed and thousands of their workers found themselves jobless.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore important that we are able to correct the errors of unsuccessful past decisions as soon as possible and change the current mechanisms causing the decline of food production in Europe. The Commission should react to changes in economic conditions more promptly and stimulate employment and promote economic growth through its actions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the reform of the sugar market, carried out by the EU in 2006 and 2007, has shown its limits. There has been a slump in production across Europe. Many Member States have ended up importing sugar after being net exporters several years ago. This is also the case for Romania, which is no longer able to meet domestic consumption requirements from domestic production output.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The future common agricultural policy will have to take into account these factors. The quota system needs to be adapted to the actual production, processing and consumption capacities of each state. The Commission will also need to ensure fair competition between the three models of sugar production. I am referring in this case to cane sugar refineries, which are experiencing major difficulties in terms of the provision of raw materials.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Those who are now complaining are those who have yet to make these adjustments. They should, however, bow to the competition because these are the rules that we have agreed – and by ‘we’, I mean the Commission, Parliament and the Council.</p>

      <p sl="bg">It is a fact that, as a result of the reforms implemented ever since 2007, my country – Bulgaria – has almost completely stopped producing sugar and has become an importer of raw sugar which is refined, with a small part exported and the rest remaining for domestic consumption. The country has a national quota only for the production of isoglucose – our sugar beet quota is closed. Six approved ‘permanent refiners’ of raw cane sugar and one company producing isoglucose are operating on the territory of Bulgaria. The Bulgarian sugar refineries run at low capacities because they do not have enough raw sugar to refine due to the low levels of raw material imported from third countries enjoying preferential agreements. The production of sugar and confectionery declined in the 2005-2011 period, while the prices of the products made, including refined sugar, increased. Given the restrictions on the maximum price of exported sugar, producers make their profits primarily from the surcharge on sugar for domestic consumption. Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to review the sugar production control mechanisms and find a balanced approach to combine the three models of production in a competitive environment. I congratulate colleagues on their actions and will join them in their attempt to achieve greater fairness in the EU’s sugar sector.</p>

My fellow Members have referred to significant distortions of competition in the market, which should be one of the most important foundations of the European economy. The end consumer also suffers: in a small market such as Estonia, sugar is imported at world market prices, which are very high for our consumers.
