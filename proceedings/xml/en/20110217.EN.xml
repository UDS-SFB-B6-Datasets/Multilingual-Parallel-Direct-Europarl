      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report (A7-0019/2011) by Mr Kalfin, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union (COM(2010)0174 - C7-0110/2010 - 2010/0101(COD)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the current mandate of the European Investment Bank for its operations outside of the European Union expires at the end of October. The European Parliament and the Council have to agree on the conditions for its extension beyond that date.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has discussed the issue very thoroughly over several months. During that period we discussed many ideas and tried to listen to the opinions of many stakeholders. We held dozens of meetings, both outside and within Parliament, between the political groups working on the text.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to take this opportunity to thank very much all my colleagues from the political groups, and the administration, for their dedication, their work based on the highest professional standards, and their endeavouring to achieve a broad consensus on a mandate for the European Investment Bank that will make a difference in fulfilling the EU’s objectives. I also thank very much the European Investment Bank and the Commission for their constant support and advice, which was very valuable for our work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we have a draft decision to be voted by Parliament which provides for more coordination between the European Investment Bank and the other EU bodies, for more transparency and stakeholder participation, and for a better monitoring and reporting system: a decision that will improve the visibility of the impact of the bank’s activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this decision, we shall start elaborating the common EU position with the Council. The draft decision preserves the very successful profile of the European Investment Bank as a top-rated financial institution and investment bank. At the same time, being an EU institution, the European Investment Bank is expected to contribute better to the goals of the Union through its specific means and tools.</p>
      <p sl="en">The changes proposed are based on accumulated experience and on the understanding that the profile of the European Investment Bank as a top-rated investment bank should not be jeopardised.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament proposes much better coordination between the External Action Service, the Commission and the Bank in implementing the EU’s external policy objectives. The European Investment Bank will have to devise development and environment impact parameters and report on their completion. It will indirectly contribute to the eradication of poverty and to climate change mitigation in the developing countries, and stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of local communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The monitoring and reporting systems guarantee more transparency, better access to information and increased possibilities for the stakeholders to give their opinion at an early stage of the consideration of the projects. An additional sum of EUR 2 billion will be released for use in environment-related projects. This should contribute to the efforts of the European Union partner countries to finance efforts to implement climate-related policies. Let us hope that this new instrument will create incentives for the potential recipient countries to commit more to the climate-related goals of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament suggests, also, an increase in the ceilings of the EU guarantees to be used by the Bank. At first glance this is a very difficult decision, because it is extremely sensitive for the Member States. Any increase in the ceilings means effectively a 9% contribution to the Guarantee Fund, but on the other hand this is an extremely good instrument creating leverage and attracting more funding institutions to the EIB projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed increase in ceilings amounts to about EUR 1.7 billion, and would allow the bank to at least maintain the intensity of its activities in the pre-accession countries, and especially in the Mediterranean region. In recent years, at the request of the Council, this financing has been intensified. Therefore, the EU has to make an additional effort to support the economies of the countries of the Western Balkans and North Africa, especially in these times.</p>
      <p sl="en">This would not involve substantial costs, whereas the benefits of achieving the EU’s objectives in these regions would be very high. We ask the European Investment Bank to develop a stronger capacity for assessing and reporting on development, environment, and the human rights aspects of their projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will have to ask loan promoters to consult local stakeholders before deciding on projects. We reconfirm the good practices of the bank in avoiding working with partners incorporated in non-cooperative jurisdictions and using tax havens. We propose to establish a working group that will suggest better cooperation and blending of the funds from different donors by the middle of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">A working party will analyse current practices as regards the disbursement of development assistance by the EU and the Member States, in order to increase its efficiency and the visibility of Europe as the major development assistance provider in the world. (debate)</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, and other Members of this Parliament for their constructive approach to the proposal, which highlights the significant interest Parliament shows in the European Investment Bank’s activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that Parliament has now achieved a balanced report which will provide a solid basis for the upcoming negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last April, the Commission issued a legislative proposal to amend Decision 633/2009/EC following a mid-term review of the application of the EIB external mandate.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is now essential to make a timely decision allowing the EIB to pursue its external work until 2013, while at the same time enhancing the mandate to ensure that EIB investments outside the EU are increasingly aligned with EU policy objectives, in particular in the areas of climate change and development.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards today’s vote, several amendments put forward are acceptable to the Commission. Those amendments relate to, firstly, the request to enhance the development aspects of EIB activity and, secondly, the call for an increase in the regional ceilings of the general mandate. This could, inter alia , allow the EIB to maintain a reasonable level of activity in certain regions, notably pre-accession. It should also be instrumental in helping the EIB to take part in our joint efforts to provide support to Tunisia and Egypt in the democratic transition process. Thirdly, the general request for more transparency, better reporting and better efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, additional negotiation will be needed in the context of the trialogue for other amendments. Those points relate to, firstly, the restriction from eligibility under the climate change mandate of countries deemed by the Council not to have committed to meeting appropriate climate-change-related targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there are some amendments aimed at establishing the regional operational guidelines as delegated acts, which would not allow them to be operational and flexible general orientations as we initially foresaw them in the Commission proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly and finally, there are some amendments which relate to longer-term issues such as the creation of an EU platform for cooperation and development, or the reflections on longer-term perspectives for cooperation and development financing, that are not strictly related to the implementation of the current mandate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should be careful, because the negotiation on these amendments might delay the adoption of the decision, and we might consider not engaging in lengthy and complicated negotiations in the framework of this decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">Trialogue between the institutions will start on the basis of the report adopted today. The common aim is to have the decision adopted before the summer in order to pre-empt any risk of non-decision by October 2011, which would cause the suspension of EIB external activities after that date.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011-000" speaker_id="28166" name="Vincent Peillon" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Kalfin for the excellent work we have been able to carry out together and, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I was the rapporteur, to thank my colleagues Mrs Hautala, Mr Lambsdorff and Mrs Giannakou.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As he has done so himself, I am not going to review the positive points of the report and the proposal defended by Mr Kalfin on the climate change mandate, the increase in human resources, the attention paid to social and development aspects, the environment, human rights, the shift in focus of the guarantee towards countries that need it most, and a stronger link with EU policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament is united on all these points – let me make that clear – and it must remain so during the difficult negotiations that, as I have just heard, await us with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings at this stage. I regret that neither the need to now prepare the EIB for microcredit nor the need to already begin the debate on the post-2013 ceilings has been taken on board, even though the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted for both of these things in the consensus reached by all the political groups. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament decided, with the consent of Mr Kalfin and of the other rapporteurs, to table amendments in plenary on these two subjects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, there is one crucial point to which I should like, politically speaking, to draw your attention and which has been the subject of debate for years. When the Berlin Wall fell, we were able to react not only with the enlargement project, the practical arrangements of which some may question, but which is undeniably necessary, but before that, we established the EBRD so as to be able to support the necessary economic and democratic transition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union, and also the EIB, as the power behind it, is the largest provider of funds to the other side of the Mediterranean. At the same time, however, we know that the payment of those funds will not continue beyond one programming period – in other words, beyond 2013, as I mentioned just now – and that the discussions that we are having today show that there may be difficulties in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is a project – already adopted by the European Parliament and endorsed in the report on the Union for the Mediterranean – which is referred to in the Kalfin report being debated today, and it is the creation of a Euro-Mediterreanean codevelopment and investment bank. This would be a practical way, beyond rhetorical statements, of acknowledging the European Union’s will to support the major democratic movement taking place on the other side of the Mediterranean, and I hope that this will be seriously addressed and that steps will be taken, in the coming months, to promote the creation of that bank.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the rapid rate of economic growth in developing countries is passing huge swathes of people by. Even in African countries, economic growth sometimes hits double figures, as is evident in major cities, such as Addis Ababa. However, inequality is growing just as rapidly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is women and farmers, especially, who are not being given enough opportunities to develop their livelihoods. One of the major barriers is access to financial services. Private banks simply have more confidence in traders making quick profits than they do in women and farmers.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Public banks have an irreplaceable role to play here. With this legislative resolution, the EIB is therefore taking an essential step. The bank is no longer granting funds for just dams and roads, for large infrastructure projects of European companies. That arm of the bank’s operations needs to continue but, of course, with procedures which will allow all local stakeholders to be heard, according to the clear criteria of sustainability and social justice. Tax havens should not be given any chance in these projects.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is new is that the EIB will now also work to help small business owners in developing countries by opening the door for loans. That can be done via local banks, via microfinance institutions, although we need an additional amendment there, and via cooperation with Member States’ development banks. The EIB should be given further scope to develop its expertise internally, with sufficient staff. However, with this new dimension to its operations, the EIB is an indispensable tool for the European Union’s development policy, with a clear commitment to equal opportunities in developing countries and to sustainable economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to thank the EIB, my colleague, Mr Ivailo Kalfin and all the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, up to now the professionals who run the European Investment Bank have operated the Bank with a culture of financial probity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Loans have been made, and guarantees provided, on a prudent basis, and that is why the European Investment Bank has had very few bad loans on its books.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, what this report aims to do is to dilute the professional culture of the European Investment Bank and expand its remit to encompass a series of policy objectives. The Commissioner made this very clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">A relaxation of the commercial criteria on which the Bank has operated up to now will inevitably result in the guarantee being called on. Now this will cost the taxpayer, and I have to question, once again, whether the hard-pressed taxpayers of Europe and the UK really want their money to be used to advance purely political objectives outside the EU?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the purpose of the guarantee offered to the European Investment Bank, based on this report, is to develop social and economic structures and reduce climate change in third countries, while also promoting democracy, the rule of law and human rights. This is why I regard as positive the suggestion to increase the general mandate offered to the bank, given as well that the countries which this guarantee is intended for include accession candidate countries and those which have signed partnership agreements with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, to be able to meet its responsibilities better in third countries, the bank needs substantial resources and more specialist staff. In this context the EIB must consider promoting certain projects of strategic importance to the European Union, such as the Nabucco pipeline and other major road, maritime and energy infrastructure projects.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to stress the need for the bank to carry out some monitoring of the financed projects, both during their execution and at completion so as to verify compliance with social and environmental criteria.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, for the work he has done. Today’s vote renews the EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses on loans for investment in projects outside the European Union. This measure is of even greater significance in the current economic context, which is characterised by profound changes not only in the markets but also in production methods and approaches to the economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">While on the one hand the EIB is playing a crucial role for the European Union, on the other the Union is strengthening its political and economic presence beyond the borders of the 27 Member States. A compromise has been reached with the other political groups to amend the Commission’s original text. The discussions, which took a range of opinions on board, were constructive both within the Committee on Budgets and during the preparations for today’s sitting.</p>
      <p sl="it">The topics characterising the negotiations and political debate were: support for local small and medium-sized enterprises; maximisation of synergies in the field of development cooperation, so as to avoid duplicating our efforts in southern countries and wasting resources; the nature of the EIB, which remains an investment bank that provides loans, competes on the international markets and does not provide unsecured funding; the geographical range of the EIB’s investments, which have been extended to countries such as Libya and Iraq, but not to countries such as Belarus, in which respect for human rights as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights must be a minimum requirement for action to be planned.</p>
      <p sl="it">It looks very likely that the work done in Parliament will very quickly succeed in getting the Council’s and the Commission’s agreement. With regard to the work done, the rapporteur will table an oral amendment to increase the appropriations guaranteeing the EIB’s investments in the Mediterranean region. Such investments may help to stabilise the Mediterranean, not least in view of the problems associated with the streams of migrants in recent weeks.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, who has done a sterling job. He worked together with both the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the shadow rapporteurs from the five different committees in Parliament that were involved. I really think they have achieved an excellent result.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The financial crisis shows how very important it is to have stable public institutions responsible for granting credit in crucial investment areas when the private financial market is fluctuating. Therefore, we are now discussing the creation of new financial instruments in many different contexts, but also the development of the instruments that we already have, in this case the EIB’s activities outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would very much like to highlight three points that I hope will gain a hearing both in this Chamber and in the Council. The first concerns a greater degree of consistency between the EIB’s activities and the guidelines for the EU’s development and foreign policy. The second relates to an increase in the ceiling for projects to combat climate change, and my third point concerns increased loan ceilings which require increased guarantees from the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The majority of the EIB’s activities are directed towards Europe, but if we count the number of countries receiving loans, most of them are actually developing countries. Therefore, we are voting today, among other things, on the demand for a more stringent evaluation of projects and the demand for the EIB to carry out, in advance, a thorough assessment of whether the investment really will contribute to the achievement of our development goals. I really do call on everyone to support these demands. In order to achieve this, we also need to increase the transparency of the EIB’s activities in those countries covered by the external mandate. As things stand, we often have long, complicated chains of financial transactions that make transparency very difficult. We are also pressing for even greater attention to be paid to the EIB’s own rules against activities in tax havens.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A sound financial system is a prerequisite for a functional economy in vulnerable parts of the world. I am therefore pleased that we can now also give our support to the oral amendment, which I hope will gain the support of everyone and which will give us more resources to be able to provide to countries like Egypt and Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This report represents an important step in a direction that I hope even the Council will support in the forthcoming negotiations.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019-000" speaker_id="96683" name="Carl Haglund" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent and professional work on this report. There was good cooperation between the groups, and I think the result is a very good one.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My fellow Members on the other side of the Chamber have expressed fears that we are about to jeopardise the good work that the European Investment Bank (EIB) has done up to now. I think these fears are completely unfounded. The fact is that we are now evaluating the mid-term mandate that we have and we will take the bank in a better direction.</p>
      <p sl="sv">While it is good to remember the new and sound ideas, of which there are quite a few and which it is good to make use of at this stage, it is also good to remember, on the other hand, that sooner or later we will have to start negotiations on the EIB’s mandate for the next financial framework, in other words the one that will start in 2014. At that stage we will have to decide in what direction we want to take the bank, what new tasks we can envisage assigning to it and in what way the new tasks are to be fulfilled by means of the possible provision of new financial resources for the bank. That is important to remember.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this context, I would like to mention two details. The first is something that Mr Färm mentioned, namely the fact that it looks as though we will be able to agree to increase the resources that the EIB can use in North Africa, which I think is very positive in view of the political situation that exists there. That is precisely why the EIB should have an external mandate, namely to enable us to act in line with the Union’s objectives.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also like to emphasise something that I am sure Mr Graf Lambsdorff will also mention, namely that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe was eager for us to be able to use the EIB’s external mandate to lend money to Belarus. This is part of the policy we want to pursue and the principles we uphold in the European Union and which must in principle be respected by our important instrument, the EIB.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In summary, I think that we worked well with the political groups and that the rapporteur has done a splendid job in finding solutions that mean we will most likely receive very broad support for the report when we vote on it in just over an hour’s time. I think that is a good basis for our negotiations with the Council. I hope that the European Council is willing to view the European Parliament’s good ideas for amendments in a positive light.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to add my thanks to Mr Kalfin for his ambitious report and I would like to remind you once more that it was the European Court of Justice that demanded that the external mandate be approved under the codecision procedure. In other words, this is about greater rights for Parliament – and as self-confident Members of the European Parliament, of course we welcome that.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has set itself a whole range of praiseworthy aims in the Treaty of Lisbon: to conserve natural resources, to fight poverty and to work for democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It is therefore only right that the EIB acts as an instrument that works towards these aims, that it does not work against them but that instead everything is put in place to ensure that these aims are achieved with the assistance of the EIB. In particular, we are talking about environmental infrastructure, better water supply and sanitation, and more funds for health and training, because we know for sure that these things contribute to securing the future in third countries and make a very important contribution to combating poverty.</p>
      <p sl="de">From a green point of view, the optional mandate in the area of climate change is also very positive. An additional two billion is to be mobilised and, if we take our own objectives in the area of climate policy seriously, then naturally we must work with the EIB in this area. I find it equally pleasing that Mr Kalfin has now proposed that the EIB should also assist with economic development and democratic change in the Mediterranean area – particularly now in Tunisia and Egypt. We therefore consider these amendments, which we will shortly be voting on, to be right.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a great interest in seeing greater transparency at the European Investment Bank. The Commission must now submit a report every year. That alone, however, is not enough; what we want is real transparency. We would also like to see NGOs and other qualified bodies being involved in decisions before they are taken. We believe that this transparency will contribute to acceptance of the EIB and does not undermine it.</p>
      <p sl="de">With all the good ideas that have been put forward here in this House we also hope that the Council will not lag behind, but that it will support this ambitious political stance of the EIB and of Parliament. We therefore hope that the procedure will be completed quickly, so that we can make policies together for the benefit of citizens of third countries too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when guaranteeing loans of this kind for projects inside or, indeed, outside the EU, we need to remember that they are not without financial consequences. While it may seem like a good way of making EU money go further, we must be very careful to ensure that the appropriate risk-management controls are in place to manage these kinds of loans and the balance-sheet implications they pose.</p>
      <p sl="en">As parliamentarians we need to be fully aware of the liabilities to which we are exposing the EU budget and, therefore, Member States’ budgets. Oversight systems and transparency will be crucial when using the balance sheet for leverage, as has been shown by the financial crisis, where banks were not always fully aware of the extent of their liabilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must learn the lessons from the finance industry and be sure that we know precisely what the EU is guaranteeing and what appropriate levels of democratic oversight are being maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fundamentally, we must be sure that those individuals at the EIB and the Commission who are tasked with managing these financial products and making such wide-ranging decisions have the appropriate expertise to manage what they are dealing with.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I believe that what we are discussing here today is both the extension and clarification of the mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB) linked to a system of guarantees that are required for its financing operations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that the extension or clarification of the mandate that is being proposed is along the right lines. It will enable the EIB better to meet its own goals regarding cooperation and development aid. As long as the EIB and the European Union wish to remain in thrall to credit rating agencies there will be a problem with guarantees; that much is clear.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are those who say that perhaps this increases the risk and that we should therefore be careful when we invest in health, in education, in combating poverty, and in the Millennium Development Goals, because none of those are particularly lucrative; something else needs to be said instead. What needs to be said is, let us discuss our relationship with credit rating agencies. Let us also discuss something else, right now: how is it possible to be so careful regarding the guarantees that the taxpayer would have to give for combating poverty, and so forgetful of the way in which the European Union did not try to regulate the private banks or prevent the financial crimes in which they have been involved for all these years, and which are now being paid for with millions of unemployed? That is actually how this question should be put.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In any case, there is a problem, about which I have reservations. My reservations are very straightforward: firstly, we have a European Union that has been employing double standards in international politics. In fact, there is no reason, from a human rights point of view, why the EIB should be financing projects in Libya but not in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When it comes down to it, what are the criteria? We must be very clear about this because I also have reservations about a second issue: the European External Action Service has a very broad mandate, which includes military operations. My question is, do these aspects overlap, and how is it that the EIB cannot be easily diverted from its own goals and from the mandate for which it was created?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Investment Bank uses public funds from the nations of Europe to guarantee loans, either to financial intermediaries or to the ultimate recipients in 74 countries. When compared to other international institutions performing similar functions, the EIB’s reputation is not one of transparency, and the public disclosure policy still does not cover appraisal reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, in the case of EIB lending which is meant to go to SMEs via intermediary banks, the public still does not know where the money is going. This report fails to demand disclosure by those intermediary banks.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the EIB supports the foreign policy of the European Union, in particular the development policy. So reads the report of Mr Kalfin, my fellow member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. However, the delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) does not want the EU to have any foreign policy whatsoever and definitely no bank performing the role of politician.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The EIB is active outside the EU, no idea why, but the EIB budget is guaranteed by the EU budget and funded by the taxpayer. There are some really wonderful countries that are receiving these EIB funds, such as the Palestinian territories, Gaza, Libya, Cuba, Venezuela, Turkmenistan and the Maldives. Not one of these countries is exactly a shining example of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, however, the Commission wants to increase the EIB’ s financial ceiling. Of course, that also means that we will be investing in climate change in these countries. Can you imagine? In Gaza, in Cuba? This is material for a new Mr. Bean film, but it is actually happening!</p>
      <p sl="nl">The PVV will fight this proposal tooth and nail and will, therefore, also be wholeheartedly voting against it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work that has been done regarding the external mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB). The Union’s financial arm today plays a very important role in terms of the political commitment that Europe wants to put across concerning the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Creating lasting democratic institutions requires a great effort from the people, and Europe, which has been working with the EIB in these regions for many years, can give them valuable support during this transition period in setting up infrastructure and strengthening local businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report on which we are voting today proposes raising the ceilings with which the bank operates outside the Union by almost EUR 2 billion. This decision will enable the bank to see through some important projects that are threatened by a lack of funds but which are also strategic for the stabilisation of the Mediterranean region, as well as for the countries preparing to join the Union. A high level of coordination between the European Commission, the new External Action Service and the EIB is needed, however, in order to achieve these aims.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is very important to develop joint governance for these three players in the countries of the Union in which it operates, and I am therefore looking forward to the creation by the Commission and the EIB of a platform to examine – together with Parliament and the Council – how best to address the challenges of the Union’s external policy with financial instruments and innovative methods.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the shadow rapporteur of the European Investment Bank’s discharge, I and my fellow Member, Mr Audy, treat the European Union guarantees provided for the European Investment Bank (EIB) as a very important issue. The European Investment Bank is a key actor in financing projects of major significance both inside and outside the European Union, and its role will continue to grow. At the same time, based on the effective provisions not one European institution has the right to supervise the EIB, and we would like to change this in the future to avoid this being an obstacle to later growth.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Loans granted to countries outside the EU require greater attention and care than projects to be realised within the EU, not only because of what has just been said but also because the degree of control that can be exercised over external developments is far less than is the case for investments within the EU. The solution for this is that these projects require much better preparation. At the same time, external projects are mainly directed at strategically important but politically not always stable regions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I wish to shed light on the energy issue from among the projects being realised in these regions. More than 50% of the external investments financed by the EIB are directed at the states of the Eastern Partnership and Russia. The security and progress of these countries serve the interests of the EU directly, as this is where the decisive part of the natural gas imports and a significant amount of the electricity imports of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic come from. Thus it is indispensable for the EIB to focus on supporting projects which directly or indirectly result in an increase of security and the security of supply.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thus I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, – whom I wish to congratulate – that in the area of loans outside the EU closer cooperation must be encouraged between the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as well as the World Bank. Significant synergies can be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon makes new demands of European Union foreign policy and development policy. One has been mentioned here: coherence. In other words, our various instruments, the European External Action Service, the European Investment Bank and the Commission must act in a consistent manner. The Treaty of Lisbon also provides for greater parliamentary control, greater transparency and joint decisions on these matters. All of this will enhance the quality of the debate on foreign policy, particularly if we have greater transparency as a result of the participation of the relevant committees – primarily the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">One result of this transparency is that this Parliament has resolved to remove Belarus from the list of countries in which the European Investment Act can act without first having another debate here in this House. Are human rights being respected? Have opposition politicians been released? Does the state respect the property of its citizens? Is there freedom of the press? Are entrepreneurs able to act freely? Are there free trade unions? In our relationship with such an important neighbour – one which is located directly on the border of the European Union – these are all matters which need to be debated first, before the European Investment Bank becomes active there. I am very pleased that the House has taken up this suggestion and I call on the Council to do the same.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yesterday we had a debate on Egypt. We debated the instruments and what we could do. Baroness Ashton called for the ceiling applied to the European Investment Bank to be raised. Parliament is happy to pursue this. We need to improve how we work together with Egypt and Tunisia, with North Africa. That is only right. It is also a good example of how this Parliament can react quickly. The same is now required of the Council, which must act accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that our foreign policy instruments, especially if they are market-oriented, together with the loans from the European Investment Bank can do a lot to assist with development and economic growth in North Africa. That is precisely what is needed. If there is growth there, if there is democracy there, then we will also have fewer migrants arriving at our borders. If I may specifically address our fellow Members from the extreme right, I would like to say that your arguments are really far too rudimentary and simplistic – if not primitive.</p>

For this to be genuinely verifiable, it is very important that the bank’s activities are transparent. With this in mind, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled Amendments 6 and 7, which emphasise that all assessment documents must be made public and, in addition, that all documents pertaining to different projects must be available to the public. I would like to point out that, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Investment Bank, like all other EU agencies, has been bound by the Regulation on public access to documents.</p>

It is imperative, therefore, that it be a bank which is completely transparent and which shows how it operates, and that it does so in absolutely every detail and particular. I would like to stress very strongly that as a representative of a country which borders with Belarus, I am personally in favour of the European Investment Bank blocking every possibility of extending loans or credit which supports the Lukashenko regime. We must show that human rights to the east of the European Union are as important to us as human rights in Africa or Asia.

Many of the EIB’s investments are in countries that in the last few weeks have been at the heart of historic changes, with the toppling of authoritarian regimes by popular uprisings.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report seeks to extend Union guarantees also to other countries about which we have misgivings because of their lack of internal democracy. I believe it would be contradictory to move in that direction and wonder whether it might not instead be more useful if the EIB were to increase its investments within Europe, by financing small and medium-sized enterprises to a greater extent, for example, a hope that Commissioner Tajani himself expressed in this Chamber on Monday.</p>

      <p sl="bg">As to the essence of the report, I would like to give my wholehearted agreement with what Lord Dartmouth said. It turns out that an English lord has more social responsibility than the socialist Kalfin. We have been elected by the citizens of Europe and we must use the money raised from them through taxes, to first solve their problems and when we have solved their problems, then give money to Turkey and other countries outside the EU.</p>

      <p sl="el">The proposals contained in the report: firstly, to increase transparency; secondly, to introduce the flexibility clause for possibly reallocating regional resources; thirdly, to align EIB activities with EU external policy; fourthly, to extend the list of eligible countries and, fifthly, to increase the financing ceiling, are positive proposals which are both very useful and necessary.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, if things are as they seem, the role of the European Investment Bank will become more and more important. The most important thing, as far as I am concerned, is that this bank’s triple A rating should never be put at risk by any tasks which it might have to undertake.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we look at the debates about financial perspectives, it appears that the amount of money Member States will make available will not be much higher than is currently the case. I think that we, therefore, need to consider in particular how we can use the European Investment Bank in order to achieve some of Europe’s objectives. We have actually done that in the past, and what I always find particularly important is: what has been the multiplier effect of the guarantees we have issued to the European Investment Bank?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that it would therefore be useful if the bank produced a report indicating which have been the most successful guarantees and what it is that the multiplier factors apply to the most. This will enable us, when preparing financial perspectives, to make better choices as to which funds we should use as guarantees for the European Investment Bank.</p>

There is no doubt that in its activities the European Investment Bank should place particular emphasis on the integration of transport and energy networks, such as the Nabucco gas pipeline project, for example, and other gas pipeline projects, which are of particular interest to the European Union. In our work as part of the Eastern Partnership, we must not forget that the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights must be upheld in all countries of the partnership, including Belarus. However, until the authorities there understand that respect for human rights is something which has to be one of their most important responsibilities, finance from the European Investment Bank simply cannot be given to Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would just like to make some brief comments.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I would like to underline the importance of following the timetable. The trialogue between the institutions will start on the basis of the report that will probably be adopted today. The common aim is to have the decision adopted before the summer in order to pre-empt any risks of non-decision by October 2011, which would lead to the suspension of EIB external activities after that date. So I would underline that this is an extremely important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can also say that the EIB has been active in many countries which have become very important. The Egyptian portfolio is one of the largest in the EIB. From the start of its activities, the Bank has provided financing of more than EUR 4.3 billion, mostly to the private sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to clarify that the Bank and the budget are two different things. The Bank is operating with shareholders’ money, in this case capital paid in by the Member States. The Bank must be responsible for ensuring that all money lent is paid back. It is part of banks’ culture that they are evaluated by ratings. It has already been mentioned twice here that the EIB has the highest rating. These ratings must not deteriorate. That is very important. The professionalism of the Bank must ensure that this rating, which is also a symbol of European finances, is maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding how the EIB is controlled, there is a board. The Commission and all Member States are members of the board. The EIB can be investigated by OLAF and, of course, the Court of Auditors gives its opinion about the EIB. So there are democratic mechanisms and the Bank must operate within this framework. The EU guarantee only covers sovereign and political risks and it has never created a loss for the EU budget since its creation in 1960.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EIB is a solid institution. Of course there is a large variety of choice in decision-making – whom to lend to and how to lend – and so these political guidelines discussed here today, and your opinions, are highly valued. They will definitely be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have just three points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the European Investment Bank is a European institution. It is part of the Lisbon Treaty. As such, it should be one of those helping to achieve the goals of the European Union, be these inside or outside the Union. I would draw the attention of the people who said that the Bank should not have involvements outside the Union to the fact that the European Union has an external policy and the European Investment Bank might be helpful in achieving its goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the European Investment Bank is a financial institution which is top-rated. It is a very stable financial institution and all the amendments that we tabled were targeted at keeping its stability on the market. At the same time, this is not in contradiction with the possibility of reporting and assessing the development and the climate impact of European Investment Bank projects. Again this is not increasing the risk; this is increasing the transparency of the Bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate very much what the Commissioner said. He is right: I expect we touched on some sensitive issues that have been discussed in the Council where no decision has been taken so far, including the blending between EU loans and the grants from the Bank, and how to make European development aid more efficient. The European Union is the largest donor – not only as a Union but as regards the Member States – with very low visibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have two alternatives: either not to touch this issue because it is sensitive or to try to work with the Council to work out a better option and to increase the efficiency of all the funds spent by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="cs">This report focuses on several aspects of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB). Some of its activities are directed towards meeting EU development policy goals in countries that have difficulty obtaining finance on the capital markets on reasonable terms. The EU is using the EIB, under this policy, to try and bridge the gap between the North and the South, as less developed countries inevitably have poorer access to financing to develop their economies. I firmly believe it is right for EU instruments assisting third countries to be maintained and adequately expanded, as an expression of EU solidarity with third countries, and to fulfil the EU’s share of responsibility for the functioning of the global economy. I consider the extension of the EIB mandate to include regional operational guidelines, which will be developed by the Commission in cooperation with the EIB, following consultation with the European External Action Service, to be a step in the right direction for meeting the external policy objectives of the EU. I also think it would be beneficial to activate the EIB mandate for providing credit to Iceland, Belarus, Libya, Iraq and Cambodia. Whilst loans have been extended to Iceland to support its economy, loans to the other countries have been granted on condition that the finance is used exclusively to support the development of democracy and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The budget guarantee provided by the European Union to the European Investment Bank (EIB) ensures the bank’s stability and covers political or country-specific risks arising during the bank’s activity, primarily for countries and projects which could only access funds from the capital market with difficulty, if at all. The Decision is about the renewal of the guarantee’s mandate. It sets the ceiling for financing, lists eligible countries and defines the extent of the support available to them. The system of regional objectives is replaced by high-level, comprehensive objectives covering all regions in accordance with the principles laid down in the Decision. The European Commission, in cooperation with the EIB and in consultation with the European External Action Service, is developing operational guidelines reflecting the EU’s regional strategy for each region affected by the mandate. Among developments, greater emphasis will be laid in the future on sectors such as health, education, environmental infrastructure, water, sanitation, the development of sustainable transportation, mitigating the effects of climate change, and adapting to them. The special task of the Committee on Budgetary Control was to reinforce the budgetary control functions in the Decision. In order to enhance transparency, the future disclosure to Parliament of all reports and information related to the EIB’s activity as well as the measurement of the concrete results of projects financed by the EU guarantee, and safeguarding the right of the European Court of Auditors to audit the use of funds from the EU budget are particularly important.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, at the end of last year, the Commission revised the rules for its expert groups. In the run-up to that revision, I was able to engage in good informal discussions with the Commission’s representatives.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nonetheless, it is strange that the European Parliament has never been formally involved in this. After all, transparency is a common concern of both the Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Can the Commissioner assure me that, in the future, we will have a formal dialogue on such questions before final decisions are made?</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the last week, I again contacted all kinds of civil society organisations. Unfortunately, they have not received any reassurances whatsoever that the composition of expert groups will be more balanced in the future. In fact, they have received information about the creation of new expert groups.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I know from my own experience, from the days when I myself was working for the Secretariat-General of the Commission, that Directorates-General are small kingdoms. However, if there is political will, then it must be possible for the Commission to decide to post on a single website all information about the new expert groups and about the accompanying notification procedures. Will the Commissioner ensure this is the case or will he bow to the Commission’s official bureaucracy?</p>
      <p sl="nl">All civil society organisations are facing a huge lack of resources. That applies to the unions, consumer organisations and to representatives of SMEs. They are having to make do with a small office in Brussels, in contrast to large companies which have the resources to hire professional lobbyists. This means that, in the interests of workers, consumers and SMEs, people from outside Brussels, in particular, should be enabled to take a seat on expert groups.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, this comes with a price tag. The Commission’s website should indicate very clearly that travel and accommodation expenses will be reimbursed and, also, that a reimbursement scheme exists for other costs directly associated with work in expert groups. NGOs are often not aware of this nor do the Commission’s officials bring this to their attention voluntarily. For a self-employed person, for example, it is impossible without reimbursement to just drop their work in order to participate in an expert group in Brussels. Such reimbursement should therefore be mandatory.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) has a policy that experts who are recruited in a personal capacity should not be allowed to have any links to organisations which have a direct interest in the remit of a particular expert group. I call on the Commissioner to make DG SANCO’s policy mandatory for all DGs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to hear from the Commissioner how it is possible that the Commission’s website lists Greenpeace as a participant in Implementing Geological Disposal of Waste - Technology Platform , while I am in possession of correspondence between Greenpeace and the Commission which suggests that Greenpeace’s application for participation was explicitly rejected by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the world of politics, where no one is interested in what the Commission gets right, but is only interested in what it gets wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a very good initiative, but Parliament, as Mr de Jong says, has some concerns. We have to ensure that expert groups are open to wider groups that can at least apply to get onto these expert working groups, and obtain information on how to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to instil confidence in the expert working groups. To do that, we must have absolute transparency and, as has been said, they must not be dominated by big business, because this leads to the accusation of there being vested interests, and that undermines the work of the Commission and the work of the expert groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say this as the rapporteur on the original regulation on public access to documents, which we implemented in this House in 2001.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you well know, Commissioner, the whole principle of openness and taking decisions as closely to the citizens as possible emanates from the Amsterdam Treaty. We put this into practice with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which is currently under revision. I would have thought that this would have presented a good opportunity for the framework programme on expert groups to be introduced into the regulation – the recast proposal of 2008, which interestingly Parliament does not accept.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will notice that Mrs Macovei is in the Chamber. She has a great history of challenging for greater openness and transparency. Most political groups attach high importance to this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to know why Parliament was not consulted. Is the Commission going to open a website giving greater information as to how citizens’ representatives and civil societies can become engaged? If not, why not?</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said at the very beginning, Commissioner, welcome to the world of politics, where everyone is obsessed with what has not been done rather than with what has been achieved.</p>

    <intervention id="4-053-000" speaker_id="96711" name="Pascal Canfin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I have given my backing to this oral question because I think it is of the utmost importance for the European Commission, and the European Union in particular, to be transparent and irreproachable where lobbying is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, Brussels is the international lobbying capital, before Washington. There are more lobbyists in Brussels than in Washington, and one of the ways in which they exert their influence on the Commission is through these famous expert groups.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. You have, for example, a group of banking experts. Ninety-five per cent of the members of that expert group are bankers, and not just any bankers: only bankers from finance and investment banks, money market banks, and all the major US banks – J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – are represented in it. On the other hand, there are no NGOs or trade unions in that expert group. The idea that the Commission should be advised only by investment bankers, and US investment bankers at that, with regard to changing banking rules seems totally surreal to me after the financial crisis we have gone through.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Hence there are some very precise questions and some very precise points in this oral question being put to you: are you going to change the composition of these expert groups? Are you going to ensure that the minutes are made public and that conflicts of interest are avoided? In the European Parliament, in fact, this is a completely transpartisan issue. There are left-wing MEPs, right-wing MEPs, Green MEPs and liberals who are very interested in these issues. Why were we not involved earlier in the reforms that you have introduced?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-054-000" speaker_id="97076" name="Corinne Lepage" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I fully support what my fellow Members, and in particular Mr de Jong and Mr Canfin, have said. I can only regret that Parliament was not consulted before a final decision on the review was taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue of transparency and expertise is one that we debate on a very regular basis, in particular within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, where my experience in my field is somewhat comparable to that which Mr Canfin has just demonstrated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like, Commissioner, to emphasise two points. The first concerns the balance of the groups. This is an extremely important issue. The composition is very imbalanced: there are many very large companies, very few SMEs, and above all the industrial sector but not civil society. The fact is, the weight of the groups clearly has an impact on the decisions that the Commission has to take, since it relies on the experts’ reports. If those expert reports were of no interest, they obviously would not be consulted. Consequently, restoring the balance so that it is representative of European society is absolutely vital, and I do not see any proposals in these new rules that favour either SMEs or civil society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second question concerns the selection of external experts. It is absolutely vital that we know, or at the very least that you know, exactly who is who and where those people who are talking to you come from. If experts present themselves as independent when in reality they are representing a lobby, the expertise they provide clearly cannot be regarded as a conclusive piece of information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Extremely strict supervision and monitoring of declarations of interest is therefore absolutely vital to ensure that, if an expert is consulted as an industrial expert, things are at least clear. If he is consulted as a teacher when he is actually the representative of an industry, then things are no longer clear and they are not acceptable. I think that the issue of conflicts of interest is crucial. We have another example of this in the shape of a major problem at the Medicines Agency, which I believe we will have the opportunity to discuss again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, I beg you, Commissioner, please restore our faith in the experts, as their opinions inform the decisions that are taken.</p>

    <intervention id="4-055-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course, I do not know how much you know of the history of this issue, but I am particularly pleased to replace my colleague, Maroš Šefčovič, in replying to this question, because for the last five years it has been my domain. I was responsible for this area and am very pleased to tell you what has really been changed. It was an expert groups issue and, of course, unfortunately I have only three minutes to reply to your question. I will try to do my best.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we mentioned, the new framework for Commission expert group was adopted in November 2010. It provides that, when defining the composition of these groups, the Commission departments concerned shall aim to ensure the balanced representation of relevant areas of expertise and areas of interest, while taking into account the work to be carried out and the specific expertise required.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new framework for Commission expert groups provides for clearer and stronger horizontal rules on how to manage conflicts of interest. According to these rules, the relevant Commission services shall inform experts who are appointed in a personal capacity that, by accepting to be members of the group, they commit themselves to acting independently and in the public interest. These rules, which apply to all expert groups, constitute the Commission’s sole policy on this matter and are requirements that all services must fulfil.</p>
      <p sl="en">In October 2005, in an example of good cooperation with Parliament and Jens Bonde, MEP, the Commission launched an online public register of expert groups which provided valuable information on different aspects, such as the group’s mission, tasks and composition. Since 2007, the Commission has been gradually publishing the names of expert group members, whether formally or informally established. This goes beyond the commitment made by the Commission in the 2005 framework for expert groups, which applied only to members of formal groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2009, the composition of expert groups was fully disclosed in the register. Thus, in principle, the names of all members of expert groups are available. This was a very strong requirement that Parliament imposed in 2005 and it has been complied with.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the adoption of the new framework for Commission expert groups, the Commission drew up a new version of the register in December 2010. This new version enhances transparency by providing new and more accurate information, notably on the type of entities listed and the procedures used to select members.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the new register increases transparency on the activities carried out by each group by allowing Commission departments to either publish relevant information in the register, or to provide a link from the register to a dedicated website where information can be found.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the presentation and readability of data encoded in the register has also been improved. Given the huge amount of information to be treated, the transition from the old to the new version of the register is still ongoing. Thus, some of the data still needs to be validated. The transition needs to be completed over the next few months.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, because for five and a half years I discussed these issues with various civil society organisations and Members of Parliament, I would ask you not to mystify the experts. There is no arithmetical link between the composition of expert groups and a decision. The decision is the Commission’s political responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s committees have the same political responsibility when they meet in the presence of the same lobbyists. Do not forget that in 2005 we also launched a transparency register, then called the ‘lobbyist register’ and now the ‘register of interest representatives’, which has now developed into a joint register with Parliament. That is a great step ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">So something has been done. Things do not look so bad.</p>

    <intervention id="4-056-000" speaker_id="96824" name="Monica Luisa Macovei" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response. I am glad that I am speaking after him.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say that we would rather look to the present and the future than back to the past. We would rather see bigger steps being taken towards transparency. I join with my colleagues on this question and recall that Parliament has asked the Commission to take action to ensure the balanced representation of interest groups in the membership of expert groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Commissioner mentioned, we have a revised framework. In our view, however, there are still major shortcomings which undermine people’s confidence. I will mention some of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Procedures to detect and eliminate conflicts of interest are missing. We need a procedure to detect and eliminate these. It is not enough to send a letter to the experts asking them to decide if they have a conflict of interest or not. Professional secrecy clauses have been extended beyond Commission staff to include members of expert groups so that, instead of moving towards more transparency, we are moving towards more secrecy. The lack of transparency persists with regard to the disclosure of expert groups’ documents. Next, small and medium-sized enterprises and civil society organisations are not properly represented. Safeguards against industry dominance are insufficient. There is a risk of ‘corporate capture’ of expert groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we ask for all information about the existing expert groups to be placed on a website in a timely manner, including information about membership and members and all calls for applications.</p>
      <p sl="en">I take this opportunity to insist again on the need for transparency concerning EU fund beneficiaries. Finally, I would like to say that transparency ensures good governance and trust in the institutions. If we want people’s trust, more – and full – transparency is the only way to go.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we know that there are many clichés concerning European decision-making.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first one is that it is not transparent, but the EU is a tricky political system even for those who understand its functioning. Standard definitions hardly apply, therefore. Transparency and simplicity should be a basic aim for all actors in the EU. Our political system is sufficiently difficult on its own; we are not here to make it more difficult. Finding a legislative proposal somewhere on an EU website should not require special skills, so the user-friendly website the oral questions mention is not just an option – it is a must.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another accusation is that the role of lobbying is unclear, and the role of big business is disproportionately strong. I know that lobbying can be useful for the Commission, as lobby groups often think up important points and provide information or even whole, ready-made, policy solutions. Here again I believe that transparency is a must and I am hopeful that this will be reflected in the future lobby register.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it comes to expert groups, they should be seen for what they are: another playing field in which participants can put their interests forward. If the composition of those expert groups is biased, then expert groups merely provide one more opportunity for interest groups to succeed. However, these players are usually already good at putting their interests forward without the additional help of public authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can only repeat my colleagues’ question: is it obligatory or not for the Commission to obtain balanced advice?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is obvious that transparency in the work of every official body should be guaranteed in every democratic society. This is needed for good decisions to be made objectively and to take account of all of society or the whole country or organisation which will be affected, and not some particular interests.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore there is all the more reason why we should stress, whenever possible, that bodies connected with the European Union or the European Commission, as well as all other bodies which perform an official function, and this includes the European Parliament, should work as transparently and as openly as possible. This means the proposals that expert groups, too, should work in line with these requirements and with as much openness and transparency as possible are fully justified and warranted. This is necessary to eliminate possible conflicts of interest and to eliminate possible activity on behalf of particular interests when we do not know of this and when these actions may influence decisions which are important for the whole European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last October this Parliament introduced six new directives giving the EU powers to regulate the UK financial industry. On 7 February, I submitted a written question to the Commission advising it of one aspect of the UK Companies Act 1976. Section 27 of the Act gives a significant exemption to just one company, the Bank of England Nominees Limited. This exemption means that the identities of the shareholders of the Bank of England are kept secret.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have asked the Commission if this exemption contravenes EU law and if the new regulatory bodies will have the power to require the disclosure of the names of the Bank of England’s shareholders. Of course, I and my party do not want any EU law, but the Commission and the British Government do. Presumably then, the Commission should ensure that its law is equally, consistently and transparently applied throughout its empire.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is vitally important that people who sit on expert groups are subject to a procedure and that sanctions can be imposed on them if they make incorrect statements. It is outrageous that people can claim to be independent when in reality they are clearly not independent. There must be sanctions for this; otherwise, what we have is a paper tiger.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is the issue of who is being represented; you will be familiar with this from the business world. Here, in particular, it must surely be in the interests of the Commission to open up the groups at last to representatives of civil society. Looking at what has been achieved in respect of the financial scandals and the economic crisis it is clear that a great deal of poor advice has been given. This is something that we need to work on urgently.</p>

    <intervention id="4-061-000" speaker_id="23894" name="Anna Záborská" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to thank the group of Members for raising this urgent issue. The issue of experts does not only concern the economy. The Commission does not respect the principle of impartiality and balance in other fields either, and the resulting composition of expert groups is one-sided and does not represent the interests of all citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The first example I would like to give is that, according to Eurostat, 90% of EU citizens are in favour of families consisting of a wife, a husband and their children. The Commission, however, selects only experts from organizations such as the European Women's Lobby or the Family platform , which seek to break this family model. The Commission has, in contrast, long rejected those women’s organizations and experts who, just like the majority of EU citizens, do not agree with one-sided feminist theory.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another example is the Agency for Fundamental Rights, created and financed by the Commission. The experts of this agency support a one-sided policy agenda, without trying to reach balance and objectivity. This is evidenced by the speeches of its Director in this Parliament. Even the European Commission has distanced itself from the attitudes to freedom of religion and conscience promulgated by the chairman of this agency’s independent panel of experts, because it was drafted by lobbyists for pro-abortion organizations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that if an official European expert agency elevates political interests above professionalism and impartiality, it should be abolished. I could mention many more such cases. I would therefore like to add my voice to the questions that have been submitted to the Commission by the Members. I would like to ask the Commission to throw open the windows of the cabinet of experts, because the air in there is not clean, and this applies not only to the field of economics.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-062-000" speaker_id="4412" name="Véronique Mathieu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the cooperation and consultations of experts put in place by the European Commission really must be irreproachable from the point of view of transparency, because this is a dangerous exercise. Indeed, members representing an interest, who are chosen according to their specific tasks and their type of expertise, may represent the same interests without, however, reflecting the general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission must therefore be particularly careful to ensure that they are representative, but even more so, it should encourage contradiction. I find it unacceptable that these members should include numerous NGOs that have similar interests and a similar scope. The working papers, acts and agendas of meetings should also be made public so that they can be consulted by the general public, elected representatives and entities for which the group’s work does not have immediate implications but which will be affected from time to time. The unclear content of the expert groups’ work cannot possibly lead to reliable results, and here I am thinking in particular of the expert groups coming under the DG Sanco.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I believe that, in an effort to ensure the transparency of its operations, the Commission must involve Parliament in reviewing the supervision of its expert groups and similar entities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Article 9 of the Treaty makes clear, transparency is not just a matter for the European Commission; it concerns the people of Europe, too.</p>

    <intervention id="4-063-000" speaker_id="96818" name="Salvatore Iacolino" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our daily parliamentary activities we realise that added value is given by access to selected information that supports our legislative role and our work of providing political direction. We make use of outside human resources – although the Commission does so much more often – to supply us with analyses and guides to the current political, social, industrial and entrepreneurial situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Policy, however, is made up of decisions and choices, and these remain fully in the hands of politicians. It is a matter of making choices that may be supported by expert groups endowed with a high degree of professionalism and specific levels of competence, who are capable of expressing their opinions objectively.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence there is a need to identify effective instruments and transparent procedures that will allow the Commission to fulfil its role with the support of these autonomous or independent expert groups. We are aware that this is an extremely problematic aspect. The 2010 plan is certainly a significant step forward, but much more needs to be done. The experts’ impartiality and authority also depend on how autonomous they are and on how able they are to support political decisions fairly and loyally.</p>
      <p sl="it">Publicity mechanisms, the web and other effective methods can be simplified even further in both the Commission and Parliament. Therefore, the right of access is good; transparency is certainly good; the balance between the right to transparency and those things that cannot be handed over or passed on or made recognisable is good; and the register of lobbyists that is to be set up soon is good.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we must emphasise once again that it is policy that is paramount. If the policy is credible and competent, the experts’ role is one of consultancy and support. The decision will always be made by the one who takes responsibility for it.</p>

Given that we are all interested not only in the best possible functioning of the institutions of the European Union, but also in the transparent and fair creation and functioning of expert and advisory bodies, we would welcome a higher degree of openness on the part of the European Commission regarding implementation of the mechanism for the selection of experts for European Commission expert groups.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Reference was made here a few moments ago to the example of the European Medicines Agency, where the list of experts actually raises doubts as to the provision of independent expert advice. Therefore, Commissioner, we should work together to prevent any doubts as to the expertise, balance and independence of our advisory bodies.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier has admitted that some of the Commission’s expert groups in the financial area are unbalanced and one-sided in their composition. At present, 11 of the 25 expert groups in the financial area are dominated by the financial industry. Some groups have more representatives of the finance industry than responsible officials. Moreover, these representatives merely have to sign a preprinted declaration that they will act in the public interest if they see a conflict of interests. Such ridiculous platitudes are hardly conducive to creating transparency and neutrality.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation where the reports of the European Food Safety Agency are concerned is equally concerning. The statements on risks posed by genetic modification cite manufacturers’ reports and the involvement of genetic modification lobbyists is clear. The Executive Director of the most important specialist EU authority on genetically modified plants is thus working for the industry-funded International Life Sciences Institute.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it really warms my heart to listen to this discussion. In fact, it would be good to have some kind of memo about the history of this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission takes note of all these good ideas and advice on how to increase transparency. I should point out that in 2005 we launched a transparency initiative which included the question of expert groups. This was very largely my brainchild, as Mr Hans-Peter Martin has just recalled.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have, of course, been huge changes in relation to this question, with all the websites and information now available. But you should never regard the experts as some kind of decision-makers. They are not decision-makers and they clash with each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the same issue as has just been raised in relation to genetically modified organisms. One knows that it is not just industry that is concerned. There are different groups of experts. In the last months of the last Commission I also had responsibility for security, so all information about demonstrations came to my desk. One of the last huge demonstrations was against the abolition of subsidies for tobacco producers.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there are different views, but we are the decision-makers: the Commissioners and Members of Parliament and our Institutions. Agencies also make decisions, as do the Council and the Member State governments. Experts are not the decision-makers. There is no arithmetical link.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, I am in favour of greater transparency. It is clear that some very high-level expert groups were set up only to quietly disappear because they were not able to give any advice as they held such contradictory views.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let us work with this transparency register, which I also consider to be a great achievement, because experts and advisers are everywhere. No politician survives without advisers. Political groups have advisers and are approached by different interests, and finally it is for political decision-makers to take one stand or another. There will always be subjects where the experts will say that now you must take this or that position. This is a matter for the political decision-makers: Commissioners, parliamentarians, political groups, in accordance with the democratic system.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also the question of the composition of the expert groups. Many issues have been raised about composition. Who should assess whether their composition is balanced or not? The composition of the expert groups is determined by specific cases. Some people may mistakenly want to enter these expert groups to be part of the decision-making process, but expert groups are not decision-makers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Back in 2005, as some of us remember, there really was an element of opacity and the Commission, together with Parliament, has introduced substantial changes in this regard. By this I mean the transparency register, which registers representatives of interest groups. This applies to lobbyists at Parliament and the Commission, and a lot of information is now available to assess how great their influence is and the composition of the expert groups.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to talk about the vote on the bilateral safeguard clause. I support the adoption of the regulation on the implementation of a safeguard clause concerning free trade between the EU and Korea. I also support all amendment proposals calling on the Commission to monitor the proper and timely implementation of this legal instrument in order to prevent serious damage to industries in the European Union, and to take account of the legitimate interests of Member States regarding the specific economic situation in certain sectors of manufacturing industry.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Free Trade Agreement will affect the industrial sectors of Member States in different ways, and we therefore need the option of applying protective measures at the regional level in exceptional cases.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight the fact that last week six important Member States of the European Union – France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and Portugal – stated that Europe needs to be less ingenuous.</p>
      <p sl="it">The six countries are calling for a more effective and strategic defence of European foreign trade, because the very existence and development of the European economic and social model are at stake. The six countries point out that the European Union has opened up 80% of its market to third countries, while the other major developed economies have only opened up 20% of theirs. It is therefore claimed that there are asymmetries in foreign trade and the concept of reciprocity needs to be developed. This problem has brought many of our small and medium-sized enterprises to their knees, because they are suffering from unfair competition that stops them from being competitive in the markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, I come from Prato, a town that was once considered one of the most important textile areas in Europe. Today, unfair competition from Asia has turned it into a ghost town, because business in Prato has been utterly devastated. All these reasons have led us to vote against this agreement.</p>

From the standpoint of future prospects, it is primarily about strengthening and making better use of the external mandate of the bank in the period between 2014 and 2020 in terms of increasing the volume of loans and their quality.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also support the intention of allowing the EIB to reinvest venture capital and special loan reflows from earlier operations into new operations of the same type for the benefit of partner countries. In order to improve access to financial resources for poorer groups in the eligible countries, an additional grant of EUR 500 million should be allocated to the EIB immediately to finance micro-credits.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted against the report, since I find it unacceptable that we should be supporting investment in third countries instead of facilitating investment for European small and medium-sized enterprises, which really form the most important economic fabric of the Union. I am firmly against the inclusion of Turkey among the pre-accession countries: I would point out that Turkey still illegally occupies part of the territory of Cyprus, an EU Member State.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, there is no guarantee of transparency when the European Investment Bank (EIB) grants Union guarantees and finance to third countries. I would point out that European citizens contribute to EIB funds, which is why priority should be given to investment within Europe itself. Many of the investments supported by the EIB are in countries where clashes and uprisings against the various regimes are taking place.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, while we voted firmly in favour of the safeguard clause in the report by Mr Zalba Bidegain, whom I thank once again for his excellent work, we abstained on the trade agreement with Korea with some regret. We did so with regret because, although this agreement does indeed open up an important new market for the Union, paving the way for further trade agreements in future with other economic partner countries of the Union, it is also true that many doubts and misgivings remain. These doubts and misgivings affect major commercial sectors, especially the motor industry, and also textiles and agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="it">Although Europe has not yet defined the regulation on the indication of country of origin for products from outside the European Union, we continue to offer countries privileged status for importing products into Europe without demanding rules to ensure true equality for companies or information for people that purchase the goods.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our abstention confirms that we are in favour of a free market, but one that includes the necessary guarantees, whereas we are against the conclusion of trade agreements that do not sufficiently guarantee the rules of competition.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement will bring innumerable benefits to European industry, businesses, entrepreneurs and employees. It will contribute to overall economic growth and open up effective new opportunities for European goods and services. However, certain industries will be exposed to additional competition, and the EU should therefore ensure effective monitoring of the implementation of the agreement, the rapid settlement of disputes and the subsequent rapid safeguarding of the legitimate interests of European industry and European entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is obvious that strict compliance with labour, technical and environmental standards, as well as provisions on the protection of fair competition have to be ensured by both parties. Goods and products placed on the European market must comply with all standards of the European Union, and I welcome the establishment of a monitoring committee for the motor industry, which should help prevent so-called hidden protectionism through new technical barriers to trade.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am therefore in favour of granting final approval to the agreement in question, provided that a bilateral safeguard mechanism will be created as well, in order to prevent possible serious damage to Member State industries, or even the threat of such damage.</p>

South Korea is the 15th largest economy in the world and the third largest in Asia. We will see better and better opportunities for exporting. We have a country with respectable economic growth, a population of 50 million and increasing purchasing power. The agreement will quite simply provide the opportunity for Europe, in some service sectors where we are extremely competitive, to now become even better: these include telecommunications, the environment, shipping and financial and legal services. I would also just like to point out today that the EFTA countries have had a free trade agreement since 2006, and this has resulted, among other things, in Norway tripling its exports to South Korea since 2006. Hence, this is a very good agreement for Europe and I have therefore voted in favour of it.</p>

In recent weeks, we have witnessed a national rebellion in Egypt, which has resulted in President Mubarak stepping down after 30 years of authoritarian rule. It is always right when the will of the people prevails, and the Egyptians deserve recognition for their victory. I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, and in doing so I expressed my hope for a rapid stabilisation of the political situation in Egypt and further development of good relations with the countries of Europe. Not long ago, we witnessed shameful events relating to discrimination against Coptic Christians, and this makes concentrating EU diplomatic efforts on stabilisation and law and order in Egypt an essential condition for mutual relations to develop properly. It is also necessary to make every effort to ensure that the coming elections are held in a way which does not attract criticism and which is in accord with democratic standards.</p>

Perhaps, though, it is worth remembering and acknowledging that for 30 years the EU and the West have supported Mubarak. It is stability that has been important for the EU. That means equilibrium and the supply of oil, and, in addition, the fact that money has been made out of the arms trade. Now the EU needs to find ways, including financial measures, to boost its support for civil society actors, both in Egypt and in other undemocratic countries in Africa and the Arab world.</p>

However, as Commissioner Hahn proposed, people are now talking about a strategy for the Danube region rather than a Danube strategy, because this is not just about cleaning up the river – as important as that is – but is about cooperation across a major region that extends from Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg through the former Austria-Hungary and across large parts of the Balkans.

The independence of the Russian courts is, therefore, the subject of a great deal of doubt.

I have been a close observer of political developments and the situation as regards the rule of law in Russia for many years now. Most recently, I had a chance to visit Russia with an official delegation of the Human Rights Subcommittee in September last year.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the visit I had a first-hand opportunity to observe how the rule of law is upheld in Russia when attending the trial of the former Yukos boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and his business associate, Platon Lebedev. The trial of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev is only the most conspicuous of many examples of the selective application of the rule of law in Russia, which means that there is no genuine rule of law.

The man responsible for this is Mr Putin. It is Mr Putin who is bringing about this deterioration in the rule of law. We need to realise that he is not the solution to the problem, but rather is a major part of the problem. President Medvedev has yet to prove – and here I agree with Mr Kelam – that he is not simply the charming face of Mr Putin, the slightly more friendly face, but that he is actually attempting or in a position to consolidate the rule of law somewhat more in this member state of the Council of Europe, which is after all obliged to ensure the rule of law under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">To this extent we need to be highly critical; naturally we must maintain a dialogue, but we also need to ensure that the rule of law prevails.

However, to be able to create sustainable jobs, we need to have primarily a competitive economy, which is precisely the role played by cohesion policy.

The fishing industry is one which supplies the EU and world market with a substantial amount of food. However, the European Union is the greatest importer of fish products from other parts of the world.

We must not allow further elimination of instruments which regulate the market and maintain stocks at suitably high levels, and this includes cereal stocks.

The establishment of this clause represents, above all, recognition of the devastating consequences of the liberalisation and deregulation promoted by the agreement. Moreover, it does not remove the dangers and concerns that this agreement involves and raises regarding the future of various sectors of economic activity, particularly in some Member States, such as Portugal, and in the regions that are most dependent on those sectors. The particular goal of the bilateral safeguard clause is to enable the EU to re-impose most-favoured-nation (MFN) customs duties if it is proven that liberalisation resulting from the agreement could cause serious injury to EU industries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The decision of Parliament and of the Council intends to grant a European Union (EU) guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the EU. The objectives of these EIB projects, currently being carried out in a number of countries on different continents, focus on development cooperation and aid. Where these objectives and the projects that serve them relate to genuine cooperation, taking into account the interests, priorities and specific conditions of the countries where they are taking place, we value them, naturally. Nevertheless, whilst this financing for local development projects is positive, we cannot fail to be very critical of the attempt – clear in Article 1 – to make them subordinate to or conditional on the guiding principles of European external policy, ascribing secondary importance to the real development needs of third countries, limiting their capacity for administration and legitimate options, interfering with and pressuring their political decisions, and threatening their sovereignty and independence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am taking advantage of the vote on this report on EIB financing of projects outside the European Union to denounce a very serious matter to which European shipbuilders have drawn our attention: that a public bank is financing the construction of vessels in Korea by a shipyard which charges rock-bottom prices and which benefited from a public bail out a few years ago. While it may not seem all that illogical for the European Investment Bank to support, through its loans and guarantees, the Union’s external policies, it is completely unacceptable for it to undermine European economic interests and contribute to the deindustrialisation of our countries.

The aim of the proposed EU guarantee for the 2011–2013 period is to allow the EIB to finance investments outside the EU without affecting its credit rating. The proposal also contains a number of new elements, for example activation of the EUR 2 billion ’optional mandate’ for combating climate change in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy, the introduction of new horizontal goals, and the expansion of the group of countries eligible for EIB loans. The proposal also calls for greater transparency, the evaluation of concrete results and the involvement of the European Court of Auditors in auditing the transactions in question. The proposal rightly includes arrangements for the EIB to act in such matters in accordance with the principles of aid effectiveness outlined in the European Consensus on Development and also Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Paris Declaration of 2005 and the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008. Overall, I believe that the report submitted by my colleague Ivailo Kalfin provides a detailed analysis of the given issues, makes reference to the relevant EU legislation and also contains relevant recommendations with respect to monitoring the effectiveness of the proposed guarantee, and I therefore recommend approving it in its proposed form.</p>

This is a commitment from the EU to avoid policy choices that undermine its salutary work in the field of development cooperation and, indeed, to pursue actions, across the policy spectrum, that will benefit developing countries. This applies to all EU institutions, including the EIB. The vast majority of eligible countries under the EIB’s external mandate are developing countries.

The Korean market obviously offers significant opportunities for EU goods and services, but has remained until now relatively closed off due to high tariffs and costly non-tariff barriers. The agreement will succeed in quickly removing almost EUR 2 billion worth of EU export duties levied annually on exporters of industrial and agricultural products. It will generate immediate, substantial savings in several economic sectors. The benefits will become even more evident in the agricultural and services sectors as Korea is one of the most valuable export markets in the world for EU farmers, with annual sales in excess of EUR 1 billion.

In this case, the following sectors are of particular concern: textiles, automobiles and related components, and electronics. However, the agreement also covers agricultural products, promoting intensive, environmentally unsustainable production models; models that are at odds with local production and consumption, which are needed to safeguard food sovereignty and safety. We are faced with the largest free trade agreement concluded by the European Union in many years, which is now intended to function as a first step in concluding a ‘new generation of bilateral new business agreements’.</p>

Therefore, as the rapporteur acknowledges, this agreement will mean the irreversible destruction of numerous jobs for thousands of workers in Europe, in very sensitive economic and strategic sectors such as agriculture or the textile industry. This agreement is another step backwards in terms of the need to move towards food sovereignty and security, which requires the EU to promote and make a firm commitment to local markets and agricultural products.

      <p sl="it">The removal of tariff barriers would play against the interests of our productive sectors. The only clause that can be applied to mitigate the disadvantages is the one that can lead to the adoption of emergency measures.

Indeed, their exports to Korea should increase by almost 40%, and exports of industrial and agricultural products will be exempted from customs duties amounting to some EUR 1.6 billion per year. What is more, it will be possible to limit any adverse effects on the European economy thanks to the implementation of a safeguard clause.

It covers many areas beneficial to EU producers and consumers, such as the elimination of tariffs on EU exports of industrial and agricultural goods, improved market access for EU services suppliers, the removal of non-tariff barriers in electronics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, enhanced access to government procurement, protection of intellectual property rights, improved market access for EU car manufacturers and, very importantly and thanks to the safeguard clause, the protection of European car manufacturers against any imbalances that may occur in the sector in the future.</p>

We also need to mobilise and review current instruments so as to assist social, political and economic reforms, and strengthen cooperation with civil society organisations, inasmuch as events in Egypt and other countries have highlighted the need for policies and instruments that are more ambitious.

Mr Mubarak’s departure is an essential condition, but it is not enough to ensure that Egypt embarks on a path towards democracy and human rights.

During the 18 days of demonstrations that led to this result, Egypt suffered financial losses, and they are becoming worse each day. The European Union must offer its support to Egypt so that the achievements of the revolution are not destroyed by a harsh economic and social crisis. So far the EU has harnessed substantial resources under the European neighbourhood policy with little in the way of results, and this has not done much for the EU’s image. However, our role remains crucial. We should not criticise ourselves unfairly. Revolutions are peculiar in that they always seem inevitable after the fact but impossible before it.

The European Union should take action to support the Egyptian people with every financial assistance instrument as well as initiatives to promote democracy and defend human rights. Similarly, we need to monitor the situation that has come about in the Mediterranean, particularly on the Italian coast, where 4 000 landings were recorded in just four days. These figures echo the exodus that took place on a biblical scale in the 1990s, when unseaworthy boats brought hordes of dispossessed people from Albania to the Adriatic coast. The Italian Government’s declaration of a state of emergency is, in my view, an important and necessary decision, but it is only the first step, because there is a real fear that Egypt and Algeria may be affected after Tunisia. This is a problem that Italy is not in a position to cope with alone: it is therefore up to Europe as a whole to examine countermeasures, to take direct action, and to provide hope at home for those who are tempted to set off on the wave of feeling that is sweeping through the Maghreb countries.</p>

Experiences such as this one demonstrate that a coordinated approach is needed in order to use the available funds efficiently. In this context, I would stress the importance of technical assistance for the implementation of actions and projects. I would also remind you that this macro-region is of particular significance to Europe, since it can improve neighbourly relations with south-east Europe and encourage political and economic cooperation with the Balkans. In order to evaluate this strategy’s effectiveness, I agree that its implementation should be analysed; along with an analysis of the Baltic Sea Strategy, which could point to possible sources and methods of funding for pilot projects of other macro-regional strategies in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region. The Danube region, comprising 14 European countries and 115 million people both within and outside the EU, is an area where enhanced synergies between various EU policies – cohesion, transport, economic, energy, environment, culture, education, agriculture, fisheries, enlargement and neighbourhood policies – can be developed. Importantly, the strategy should contribute significantly to improving multi-level governance and involvement of partners operating in the Danube region and civil society, and would ensure prosperity, sustainable development, job creation and security in the area. I agree with the resolution’s call for the Member States and the regions to use the Structural Funds intended for the period 2007 to 2013, in order to ensure as much support as possible for the implementation of this strategy, particularly by promoting the creation of new jobs and economic growth in the areas worst affected by the economic crisis. The Danube region is Europe’s gate to the Western Balkans, and therefore I believe that the European Strategy for the Danube Region will not only be conducive to the improvement of neighbourhood relations in Central and South Eastern Europe, but will provide important added value in the EU’s Eastern European policy. This will be an excellent opportunity for the entire Union to fortify its political and economic cooperation with the Balkans, and to contribute to the expansion and consolidation of European integration in the region.</p>

Romania will coordinate four priority areas: river transport, tourism, culture and the management of risks produced by extreme phenomena.

It is necessary to enhance the Danube’s cultural environment by promoting cultural dialogue, supporting university exchange programmes and youth projects based on transnational cooperation, fostering sustainable tourism, and protecting the historical and built heritage.

      <p sl="ro">It is important for the EU Strategy for the Danube Region to be adopted during the European Council summit in June so that its implementation can be launched as soon as possible. However, it is just as important to attract the existing European funds for developing this region, amounting to EUR 100 billion, through the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and European Social Fund. These funds will provide direct support to the strategy’s implementation. If there are no definite projects which will use these funds, the strategy will become worthless. The purpose of the Strategy for the Danube Region is to create jobs and boost economic growth in the crisis-hit regions. Utilising the regions’ specific features could result in a much more efficient use of the Structural Funds and in creating added value at regional level, while the financial resources which have not been used could also provide a source of funding for macro-regional projects. The adoption of the Strategy for the Danube Region is a natural outcome of the summit on this region which was held in Bucharest at the end of last year when a significant indication was given of the economic importance that the EU attaches to this river.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The River Danube links ten European countries. The Danube also represents significant socio-economic potential, with over 200 million people living in the surrounding region. The Danube region is an important focal point for EU cohesion policy programmes. The Strategy for the Danube Region is focused on three priority areas: connectivity and communications (including transport, energy, and the information society); environmental protection and prevention of natural disasters; and boosting the potential for socio-economic development. In my opinion, the Strategy for the Danube Region should be implemented with a bottom-up approach by facilitating the movement of goods and upgrading infrastructure, and thereby improving general business conditions throughout the region. The Strategy should not be a reason for setting up new institutions. Its main purpose should be to strengthen coordination between the individual regional players. For this reason, the Strategy should not be allocated any specific funds.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is therefore necessary to insist that the Council-approved principle of the ‘3 NOs’ be applied: in other words, that there is budgetary, legislative and administrative neutrality. In this respect, the macro-regional strategy should primarily be a tool for boosting the effectiveness of cooperation and making better use of existing resources. It is also necessary to respond to criticism of the Commission's intention to encourage shipping on the Danube by improving its navigability.

      <p sl="lv">With this motion for a resolution, Members wish to draw attention to the disquieting events in Russia, which, as a member of the Council of Europe, has undertaken to comply fully with European standards of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. In truth, these standards are being ignored and crudely infringed. A glaring example of this is the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, the former owners of Yukos. This case has descended to the level of farce, and does not give the impression that there is one law and one system of justice for all in Russia. Whereas efforts are being made to convict the opponents of Russia’s Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, nothing is being done to solve the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and other journalists who have been killed. The right to hold meetings is being withheld from those who think differently in Russia, and defiance of the ban can lead to imprisonment. All of this is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="lv">We want Russia to be a democratic, economically developed and stable country that can be a reliable partner to its neighbours, the European Union and NATO countries. Unfortunately, Russia’s leading politicians carry on a wholly different policy, which increasingly alienates Russia from other democracies. If Russia wishes to become a member of the World Trade Organisation, its leading politicians must greatly change their attitude towards democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p>

I am pleased that Parliament, in adopting this resolution, recognises in principle that the rule of law and democracy do not exist in Russia. Nevertheless, I should like to stress that the European Union policy towards Russia will be successful only when Member States pursue a common foreign policy. Recent events, when France concluded an agreement to sell Mistral class warships to Russia, are evidence that Europe’s common foreign and security policy is a mere fiction. The interests of France were more important than a common foreign policy. The agreement was concluded despite objections by the Baltic States and comments by Russian generals about the potential of these ships, which was lacking in the war with Georgia. Transactions of this sort undermine trust between European countries and testify to the success of Russia’s ‘divide and rule’ policy. The European Union can promote the rule of law in Russia only if the Member States place the common interests of all European countries above their own individual interests.</p>

First and foremost, I think that it is right that the European Parliament has used every opportunity to open up the issues of human rights and the quality of the rule of law. We should do this more often, and with more countries. My second comment concerns the format. Our comments must be businesslike. That means not just preaching to others in a paternalistic way, but also offering a helping hand. Frankly, I have no idea how the critics of the Yukos oligarchs’ trial can be so certain that political pressure is being put on the trial process. Attacking a verdict, and ignoring evidence that has been presented on tax evasion and other offences is surely a form of political pressure. Why do critics automatically assume that the evidence has been falsified? I have numerous other similar examples. Russia has two main problems associated with the rule of law. The first is the fact that the country is undergoing a transformation of its law and legal culture. That takes time and will not happen through the good will of the Kremlin alone. The second problem is the unstable security situation and the lack of trust in the good intentions of some advisors. How will the European Union help Russia in the fight against terrorism and the extradition of terrorism suspects who have found a safe haven in EU countries? How will the EU act against the violation of the political rights of so-called ‘non-citizens’ in EU countries? It is not enough just to hand out advice; we need to offer help as well.</p>

The EU and Russia need to intensify negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement that is comprehensive and binding, and which covers the areas of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human and fundamental rights. It is necessary to develop joint initiatives with the Russian Government aimed at enhancing world security and stability and, in particular, on common neighbours, in order to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Transnistria and in Georgia, in line with international law.</p>

Ever since the end of the Yeltsin era, we have witnessed a policy that consists in weakening all the public institutions. Things may appear legal on the surface, but respect for the law has been suffocated by too many rules and regulations. The Khodorkovsky and Lebedev trials are a typical example: the facade of the law is being maintained, but the law itself is being used for purposes other than its primary function. Economic growth will not allow for the rule of law. The economy for the economy’s sake leads to abuses, exploitation and partisan interests. Wealth must make for freedom, encourage collective progress and enable every individual to flourish. The market economy cannot be virtuous without a fair State, by which I mean a State that fully assumes its normal tasks in a fair and just way; a State that can guarantee that its citizens have impartial access to all fundamental rights such as access to education, healthcare, justice, culture, administration and vital basic needs.</p>

The condemnation of the terrorist attacks on Domodedovo airport is also important and demonstrates the EU’s solidarity with this important partner state. However, the tone adopted in respect of certain pending or current court proceedings (for example, in the Khodorkovsky case) is wrong and undiplomatic.

Fossil-fuel investments are also taking place through financial intermediaries, and this is not being accounted for by the Bank in its annual energy sector figures.

To conclude, therefore, not only is nuclear energy accepted; the proposal is to promote it as a ‘clean’ form of energy to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions.

For this very reason it is crucial that the World Bank adopt a new strategy for financing energy projects, committing to providing efficient, accessible and clean energy as a means of reducing poverty and fostering economic growth. In this context, when the World Bank finalises its energy strategy, given that it has previously committed to making half of its energy investments ‘low-carbon’, Parliament calls for clean energy projects to be prioritised and, especially, for a clear commitment to renewable energy, as a means of promoting sustainable development in underprivileged regions.</p>

Whether it be during the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework or in the debate on EU own resources, Parliament will have to make itself heard to ensure that the commendable targets of the EU 2020 Strategy are matched by appropriate funding options.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because the European Union Member States should be encouraged to give the highest priority to tackling unemployment and preventing long-term exclusion from the labour market in their national programmes and plans. This should be combined with measures to ensure more job creation, better jobs and high levels of high quality employment in the medium and longer term. I would like to stress that the Member States should pay more attention to tackling child poverty through appropriate measures so that children are not restricted in their personal development and are an equal and full part of society when entering professional life. I welcome the flagships aimed at implementing the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, such as ‘An industrial policy for the globalisation era’, ‘An agenda for new skills and jobs’, the ‘European platform against poverty and social exclusion’ and other initiatives. I agree with the proposals on the ‘European platform against poverty and social exclusion’, but I would encourage more specific action to be taken to ensure social inclusion. It is also very important to draw up a specific programme aimed at promoting decent work, guaranteeing workers’ rights throughout Europe and improving working conditions, combating inequality, discrimination and in-work poverty.</p>

It aims to promote knowledge, innovation, education and the digital society; to make our manufacturing infrastructure more resource-efficient, whilst reinforcing competitiveness; and to increase the rate of involvement in the labour market and the acquisition of qualifications, whilst combating poverty. In particular, I would stress the ‘Innovation Union’ initiative, which addresses major social challenges like energy and food security, climate change, health, and the ageing population. However, there is a need to enhance, stimulate and secure the financing of research, innovation and development in the EU. I call for increased funding for crucial instruments for research, innovation and deployment that have already been adopted, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan).

The Europe 2020 Strategy follows on from the failed Lisbon Strategy and cannot provide answers to questions such as how we are to recover from the crisis and create new jobs. Applying this strategy – and hence the erroneous policies that resulted in the crisis – to the letter will undermine the rights of European workers still further. The socio-economic governance of the EU needs an alternative policy that will reject any ‘Competitiveness Pact’ and help to bring about real economic convergence between the Member States. The European Union is in dire need of strategies that will promote values such as solidarity, social justice, gender equality and an honest effort to combat poverty.

      <p sl="pt">The world in general and the European Union in particular have been experiencing difficult times, of which the current economic and financial crisis is an example. With the goal of bringing about the end of this situation, on 17 June 2010 the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 Strategy for employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It is a growth strategy for the next decade that boosts the European economy to achieve high standards of employment, productivity and social cohesion. The goals to be achieved by 2020 are ambitious: in terms of education, reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% and increasing the percentage of 30- to 34-year-olds who are graduates to 40%; in social terms, pulling 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and social exclusion. The intention is also to invest 3% of gross domestic product in scientific research.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the choice for Europe 2020 of flagship initiatives aimed at education, employment, young people, innovation, the digital agenda, the environment, globalisation, resource use, and combating exclusion, which will encourage growth and competitiveness.

That is the case with the Europe 2020 Strategy, with which they are now associating so--alled ‘economic governance’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The leap they are attempting to make in this so-called economic governance with the creation of the ‘European Semester’ – the deepening of the penalties relating to compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, of the economic policy guidelines, and of any indicators that may be adopted – is not accompanied by a significant increase in the Community budget, which is always a crucial condition for moving towards economic and social cohesion, and for preventing the worsening of the current divergences. What they are intending is to create a veritable straightjacket for the Member States so that they will implement so-called austerity measures, which involves the deepening of the neoliberal agenda with all its serious antisocial consequences.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If there are any doubts about this, take a look at the Franco-German project on the so-called Pact for Competitiveness, which aims to raise the retirement age, put collective bargaining at risk, and deliver yet another blow to labour and social rights, all so as to ensure increased earnings for economic and financial interest groups.</p>

This crisis that we are going through is not a natural disaster but rather the consequence of the way in which the conservative, liberal and social democrat political forces have moved from the Washington Consensus to the Brussels Consensus, imposing no public intervention in the economy, pay restraint, and the privatisation of public services and of the main businesses in key sectors of the economy, such as energy and telecommunications. We already know the consequences of these neoliberal measures and of the Brussels Consensus: crisis, widespread unemployment, poverty and cuts in workers’ rights and the welfare state.

      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, gender equality is the key factor for achieving the ambitions of Europe 2020.

      <p sl="it">Following the Commission communication on the Annual Growth Survey: advancing the EU’s comprehensive response to the crisis, Parliament, myself included, has voted in favour of a resolution urging the Council and the Commission to work together to achieve our employment targets, as contained in the Europe 2020 Strategy. In the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs Berès, we need to provide the Member States with policy advice without, however, interfering too much in national policy, and to supply guidelines so that the interested parties can all work to the same plan. The lack of jobs, particularly in recent years, is a serious problem and must be tackled with a dash of ambition to ensure that by 2020 we can guarantee 75% of Europeans decent, secure jobs that meet the needs of the wide range of people who are preparing for the world of work. A particular effort is needed for certain groups, including women – especially mothers – young people and immigrants.</p>

The economic crisis faced by the EU continues to pose the challenge of how to curb increasing unemployment and social exclusion. The European employment strategy and its guidelines therefore represent an important instrument for curbing unemployment. It is also intended to steer efforts by the Member States in the right direction. As a result, the Member States are required to include social partners, regional and local authorities as well as civil society in their actions. In addition, it should be able to be guaranteed that both employment policy guidelines and the creation of new jobs will be ensured. To underline the seriousness of this key objective, the Member States are in future required to submit reports on their progress. In addition, the individual Member States are required to pay attention to national objectives, including the problems of integrating sub-groups such as women, people with disabilities and older workers, as well as the problem of the working poor.

      <p sl="lt">Following the assessment of preliminary National Reform Programmes (NRPs), the European Commission presented a proposal to keep the employment guidelines adopted by the Council last year stable until 2014 in order to devote most attention to their implementation. This proposal by the Commission is understandable because the employment guidelines are an integral part of the Europe 2020 Strategy and they must be fully transposed into the Member States’ national programmes, and therefore the Member States should focus as much as possible on their implementation. Although these guidelines will not be reviewed annually as a rule, the main priority of the European Union’s employment strategy must continue to be full employment which would increase economic growth and competitiveness and strengthen social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The examination of the Member States’ draft National Reform Programmes shows that Member States should continue to make every effort to address the following priority areas: increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment, developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs, promoting lifelong learning, improving the performance of education and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in tertiary education, promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. I would therefore like to call on the Member States to ensure the employment and social policy is implemented as effectively as possible, by drawing up, observing and assessing these national programmes.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to express my concern at the current employment situation. I would argue that unemployment is the real social problem of today. Although good signs of recovery can be glimpsed at a macro-economic level, industry cannot reabsorb all the workers that it has laid off in recent months, who now face the difficulty of re-entering the labour market. The same applies to young people and women. These problems are extremely important and pressing. Among the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, the Commission prioritised increasing employment, strengthening the single market and encouraging growth. The European Union and this Parliament in particular have done well in tackling the problem, but concrete action is needed to attain these goals.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EU must work towards channelling and rationalising its resources, while investing in transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure: in this respect, the turning point will be the creation of project companies guaranteed and financed by project bonds. That will both enable the Union to retain its competitive edge in the global market and provide people with new job opportunities. The whole system should be put into practice, albeit step by step, as soon as possible.</p>

The report proposes that the integrated economic policy and employment guidelines for the Member States adopted for 2010 should be upheld in 2011 and thus that the Europe 2020 Strategy should be fully integrated into National Reform Programmes. Unfortunately, the report calls for the same economic policies and the same employment guidelines to be applied that resulted in the crisis and the failure to deal with it. It calls for the same political choices and practices to be followed that made Europeans suffer austerity measures and sovereign Member States fall prey to the speculation mafia.

      <p sl="pl">In view of the ageing of society, demographic changes indicating a movement of population from rural to urban areas and the increasing stratification of society in terms of income, it is essential to take preventative action. Particularly adverse phenomena are to be seen in rural areas, where the number of young people wanting to take over the running of farms continues to fall. They are leaving rural areas to get away from low incomes and poor access to services. Those who stay cannot find work outside of agriculture. In the worst situation, however, are the female residents of rural areas, who very rarely are the owners of farms, but despite this they work very hard on their husband’s farm.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is why it is essential to keep young farmers in rural areas by guaranteeing them a decent income and standard of living. Those, however, who do not find work in rural areas, should be guaranteed education which will allow them to find employment. Also needed is a campaign to persuade people to join the Lifelong Learning Programme and to retrain. It is also essential to have programmes which support the enterprise of women and make it easier for women to run their own business, including businesses not connected with agriculture.</p>

Food prices have peaked for the seventh consecutive month between 2010 and 2011, reaching the highest levels since 1990. Commodity price hikes have become a destabilising factor in the global economy, which have helped spark riots and unrest in a number of developing countries and most recently in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. Poverty and famine still exist in the European Union, and 79 million people still live below the poverty line. I therefore agree with the call made in the resolution for immediate action to ensure food security for EU citizens and at global level. It is also very important for food to be available to consumers at reasonable prices, and, at the same time, for a fair standard of living to be ensured for farmers. I therefore call on the EU to support rural development, increasing investment in food security, and taking particular account of urgent hunger needs, small-scale farming and social protection programmes.</p>

      <p sl="it">The index of food prices on the financial markets has shown an uncontrollable rise in these prices over recent months, due to the international economic and financial crisis and also the recent environmental disasters resulting from climate change. The situation is aggravated even further by speculation, which has been responsible for up to 50% of the price rises, preventing many people from enjoying food security and generating political instability especially in poorer nations. As we know, this can have a domino effect and end up threatening peace and security in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Food security is a fundamental human right and is included among the Millennium Development Goals, as well as being a common agricultural policy objective. The European Union therefore has a duty to confirm both its commitment to establish a sound agricultural and rural development policy and also its support for research and technological innovation aimed at improving productivity, while meeting energy efficiency and sustainability requirements.</p>
      <p sl="it">Sustainability also means promoting the production and marketing of traditional local produce, by offering suitable financial incentives and the chance for small and medium-sized enterprises to access credit.

      <p sl="el">The popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the mass demonstrations in a series of other countries are directly challenging poverty and unemployment. The angry demonstrations by people living below the poverty line highlight the dead end into which the general economic crisis and their efforts to shift the burden of it on to the workers have brought the political forces of capital and its political representatives The FAO emphasised just a few years ago that the number of people who found it difficult or impossible to obtain the food they needed in order to survive was higher than ever before in the history of mankind, having passed the 1 billion mark, and that this would inevitably cause serious social unrest. The problem of poverty in the world is not a matter of inadequate resources; it is the result of imperialist aggression and capitalist exploitation of natural resources based solely on the profit motive.</p>
      <p sl="el">Food prices did not stop rising after the 2007 food crisis; on the contrary, they continued to rise even more sharply.

      <p sl="ro">Rising food prices in the European Union and worldwide pose a major problem in 2011. There are different causes for this and it is difficult to anticipate and control them. However, there are also causes which we can and need to control. A slow supply chain with too many intermediaries, natural disasters caused by climate change, low incomes earned in the agricultural sector or the volatility of the agricultural product market are just some of the reasons why the price of agricultural products has risen in an unacceptable manner across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that decision makers at European level must make reducing food prices a major objective on the European and global political agenda. Obviously, we are not talking about interfering in the operation of the free market, but about eliminating the speculative behaviour which sponges unjustifiably off the demand and supply chain, having an illegal influence on and distorting how prices are set. I voted for this motion for a resolution as Europe needs measures to ensure that food prices are not increased artificially by intermediaries involved in speculation.

Furthermore, whole sectors of the agricultural industry are under threat. I see this situation in my own country, Romania. Indeed, the 5% increase in the VAT rate, which has reached 24%, was reflected immediately in price rises. It is difficult to accept that a livestock farmer toiling day in day out is the victim of a market game which is played tens of thousands of kilometres away on the computers of companies which have nothing to do with agriculture, but have sufficient money to destabilise global markets.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In our report on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security, adopted in December, we stated that the right to food security is a fundamental human right, and that the EU has a duty to feed its citizens. In line with our position, it is our duty today to denounce the rise in food prices, which have soared over the last seven months. There are many reasons for this rise, but we should focus above all on price volatility and speculation on basic foodstuffs, since they destabilise our economies and create uncertainty. Stopping speculation is absolutely crucial, as is combating climate change. Indeed, food security and climatic and environmental conditions are closely linked; they make the coordination of environmental and agricultural policies vitally important. We should also turn our attention to developing countries and support them in their efforts to achieve food self-sufficiency, in contrast to everything that has been done in recent years. The challenge is huge: in Europe alone, almost 80 million people still live below the poverty line.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because there is a need to take specific action to ensure food security for EU citizens and at global level. Food prices have peaked for the seventh consecutive month between 2010 and 2011, reaching the highest levels since the Food and Agriculture Organisation started measuring food prices in 1990. Commodity price hikes have become a destabilising factor in a number of developing countries. Furthermore, the recent riots and unrest in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt have had a significant impact on this. Food must be available to consumers at reasonable prices, and, at the same time, a fair standard of living should be ensured for farmers. The European Union therefore has a duty to ensure food security for its citizens. Attention should be drawn to declining farm incomes in the EU, caused by rising production costs and price volatility, which impact negatively on farmers' ability to maintain production. There is also a need to highlight the costs that European farmers have to bear in meeting the highest food safety, environmental, animal welfare and labour standards in the world. Farmers should be compensated for these additional costs and for providing public goods to society.</p>

      <p sl="el">I abstained from the vote on rising food prices. The motion for a resolution contains a number of positive points, such as the priority of the agricultural sector in development policy. However, important points contained in the initial motion for a resolution by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left are missing from the joint motion for a resolution. To be precise, no link is made between the food crisis and the price rises caused by the agricultural and trade policies applied and, therefore, no proposal is made to change that framework. Also, the motion for a resolution calls for the food problem to be resolved by the World Trade Organisation and the G20, which is not only contrary to the demands by farmers; it also replaces the UN framework, thereby promoting decisions by the same people who caused and perpetuated the problem with their political choices. Also, the motion for a resolution does not make any reference whatsoever to the basic concept of food sovereignty, even though it is prerequisite to food security. Finally, it addresses the problem of speculation and rising food prices in a very inadequate manner, by referring simply to ‘transparency’ in food prices, with no mention as to how to put an end to financial mechanisms which can be used to create speculation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Global food prices have reached dramatic levels recently. Indeed, last December they overtook the prices recorded at the peak of the economic crisis. The UN stated recently that it considered improbable the scenario where excessive demand in relation to supply would be behind these price fluctuations. In the mid-1990s a speculative market was created which had food products at its heart and has grown during the financial crisis. Speculators are currently taking advantage of the lack of regulation of the markets, earning millions from this activity. This type of speculative behaviour has a direct impact on people’s standard of living and can contribute to political instability. Therefore, I think that the European Union needs to combat speculation involving food prices through regulation and transparency.

For this reason, common skills must be developed in conducting research and providing training in sustainable farming methods and new technologies so as to ease the collapse of agricultural systems and prevent this crisis temporarily.

The claims of direct threats to Europe’s food supply are grossly exaggerated. We are also opposed to the concern about rising food prices being used to justify a European agricultural policy based on extensive direct subsidies and regulation of the market.

It is in fact beyond doubt that droughts, floods, fires and storms – phenomena that occur more frequently now than in the past – are reducing agricultural production capacity worldwide. Good soil and water management are therefore essential to prevent the loss of farmland. It is also necessary to curb the abusive speculation that burdens the markets for food products, agricultural raw materials and energy.

Access to these markets should be reserved for professional buyers only. However, the main problem remains the need to increase world agricultural productivity. In order to feed 9 billion people better, agricultural production needs to increase by 60-70%. Only access to more efficient agriculture will enable us to conquer hunger. New seeds, as well as input- and water-saving techniques, will be able to produce the required yields. The number of farmers growing GMOs is increasing every year. There are more than 14 million of them, working more than 10% of the world’s arable land.

Growing speculation related to agricultural and food commodities lies in the background of the current increase in food prices. Investment funds are pumping huge amounts of money into food price speculation, thus forcing consumers to pay prices that exceed the production costs several times. Price rises exacerbate the problem of accessibility, in particular for people with low or no income. Expenditure on food is one of the main components of family budgets, accounting for 60 to 80% in developing countries and 20 to 30% in the less developed Member States. Financial instruments must serve the economy and must help agricultural production overcome major crises and climatic events, and for this reason speculation cannot be permitted to jeopardise agricultural production. I condemn speculation in agricultural commodities and raw materials, which contributes to increased price volatility and the deepening of the global food crisis. For exactly this reason I agree, and I support, that in the future CAP effective action cannot be taken against major price fluctuations without strategic stocks and so the role of market intervention instruments must be strengthened.</p>

Added to that is the opposition between developed and developing economies, in which the latter – which have been hit hard, albeit indirectly, by the crisis – use foodstuffs as the only weapon at their disposal. That situation has implications not only for the global market but also for small producers and for consumers, who are faced with sometimes significant price rises for essentials.

      <p sl="fr">On the eve of the G20 Finance Ministers’ meeting, Europe is once again arriving at the negotiating table unprepared. Since January 2011, the US administration has been demanding that the positions adopted by financial funds on the agricultural markets be controlled and transparent. The Commission must quickly make proposals along these lines. This advance is a first step towards denying the speculators what they crave. The impact on European livestock farmers is dramatic and immediate, too. They can no longer feed their animals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Hundreds of farms are going bankrupt. Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne. Today, it fetches almost EUR 300. The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals. It would do well today to follow its own advice. In the face of this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to come up with solutions.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it strongly criticises the rise in the food commodity price index, which in recent months has reached its highest level for 20 years. This has caused social crises, such as the uprisings that have been convulsing the entire Maghreb since December. Increased food prices are clearly bringing down living standards for the majority of workers, who as a rule spend 50% of their household income on food products. In the European Union alone, around 80 million people still live below the poverty line, and many of them are helped through food aid programmes. Poor harvests in the United States, natural disasters in Russia and Brazil, the hike in energy and crude oil prices and the ageing of operators in the farming sector are among the problems that need to be addressed without further ado. It is now more important than ever to condemn speculation, and to examine the idea of a European food stock system in order to withstand crises such as the one we are now experiencing. The aim is to look for shared, collective strategies to respond promptly to the increased demand for foodstuffs, not least through specific incentive policies to attract young people into the world of farming.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EPLP is supportive of the resolution drafted in response to the current steep food price hikes we are seeing and their impact on global food security. The most recent price increases bring to the fore many of the concerns the EPLP have long held over distortions in the food supply chain, the role speculation can play in exacerbating the situation and the lack of agricultural investment in many developing countries to build up production capacities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EPLP is supportive of the need for a global response to the food security challenge but would also like to stress the role an ambitiously reformed CAP can play in helping to address this challenge. A reformed CAP must be in line both with global food security and development policy objectives, abolishing once and for all export refunds, that undermine the ability of developing countries to build up their own agricultural production, limiting market intervention mechanisms, which also serve to distort the market and promoting sustainable agricultural production to help both the agricultural sector mitigate and adapt to climate change, thereby protecting the EU's natural resource base and food production capacity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Food safety policy is first and foremost defence policy. Any country which fails to provide safe and affordable food to its people and ensure a reasonable standard of living for its farmers is heading towards instability and food riots. The right to food is a basic and fundamental human right. The text before us rightly emphasises the need for a multidimensional approach. The steps needed to ensure safe food have much in common with the steps needed for a more efficient fight against climate change, improved development aid, the development of other commercial structures, greater transparency on the commodity markets and measures against speculation. I would have liked the text to have been even stronger, in particular by pressing for the establishment of an independent global agency that will strictly regulate speculation with food commodities.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also wanted to propose actions which are necessary to reduce food waste: 20 to 30 per cent of crops are lost at as early a stage as sowing and harvesting. In developing countries half the harvest rots because it is not being stored or transported. Meanwhile, consumers and distributors in developed countries throw 40 percent of their food products untouched into the waste bin. This is unacceptable and unethical! Finally, I think that food does not belong in the forum of the WTO. Food can never be an ordinary commodity. Never!</p>

      <p sl="fr">I welcome the adoption of this joint motion for a resolution, which highlights the main factors contributing to today’s soaring food prices. They are: the rise in oil prices; the growing production of biofuels, which is devouring huge swathes of agricultural land; the ever-more frequent occurrence of natural disasters; and speculation on the markets. The aim is no longer to supply food products at the best price, but to make as much profit as possible out of them. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, food prices peaked in January, and it is estimated that, when food prices rise by 1%, the nutrition of an additional 16 million people is put at risk. Price hikes thus become a huge challenge for developing countries, which already devote almost three quarters of their income to buying basic foodstuffs. Consequently, we fear a social and political situation even more dreadful than that during the 2008 ‘hunger riots’. Europe has a vital role to play in guaranteeing global food security. Let us hope that the G20 ministers, who will meet in Paris in June, come up with solutions to combat food price volatility.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The right to food, established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, has been severely affected by the current economic and financial crisis. The population growth that is forecast, particularly in emerging economies, and the growing rise in global poverty and hunger demonstrate that at least a 70% increase in food production is needed to satisfy the population’s needs. At the same time, financial speculation on food commodities that leads to volatility in food commodity prices is adding to this scenario, as are extreme weather events and the constant increase in bioethanol production instead of food. I believe that measures urgently need to be taken to combat the destabilisation of the agricultural markets, so supporting farmers and promoting innovation in the sector, whilst reinforcing the role of the common agricultural policy as a key objective of the European Union. This cross-cutting issue must be discussed multilaterally as it affects people worldwide and the multiplying effects are indisputable. The riots that have taken place in developing countries are examples of this. Support for at-risk countries should be reinforced to prevent future food crises.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia at the beginning of this month placed the decades-long conflict over access to the temple of Preah Vihear back in the consciousness of the international public. Although the armed clashes have abated somewhat at present, we must push for a political solution to be found to this conflict. ASEAN, the United Nations and the EU have a duty to work more intensively on this now, and not to wait until the situation escalates again before reacting.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the most recent clashes civilians and soldiers on both sides were injured and killed. The use of cluster bombs was particularly perfidious. These cluster munitions wreak havoc on civilians that continues long after their launch. Up to 30% of cluster munitions fail to explode and remain on the ground as unexploded bombs, where they later explode when disturbed perhaps by playing children. We call on Thailand and Cambodia to stop using these terrible weapons immediately. We also call on both governments to sign up to the international convention banning cluster munitions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would urgently appeal to the governments of Thailand and Cambodia to make every effort to resolve this conflict without resorting to arms. The civilian population on both sides will only suffer further; suffer for something to which politicians can find a negotiated solution if they only have the political will to do so, rather than attempting to pander to cheap nationalism on both sides of the border.</p>

We have a responsibility to protect the lives of people first and foremost, but we also have a responsibility for cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Particularly worrying is the reported use of cluster munitions. Those reports may well be true, as neither Thailand nor Cambodia has ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">To prevent further escalation, which would put the region at risk of destabilisation, both governments have to assume their responsibilities and also have to care for people displaced as a result of this conflict.</p>

      <p sl="de">The third aspect – and we want to address this too – concerns the irreplaceable world cultural heritage of the temple complex in this border region. Karl von Habsburg, a former Member of this House and the son of Otto von Habsburg, is responsible for these matters at Unesco and will attend the March plenary here in Strasbourg to tell us more about it. It is my feeling that we actually need to make concentrated efforts to combine attempts to bring about peace and protect people with the protection of cultural heritage. Here in Europe we know only too well what terrible gaps wars can leave in the cultural landscape. We must therefore take action wherever there is a threat to the world’s cultural heritage.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the beginning of February, there has been renewed fighting between the armed forces of Cambodia and Thailand at the border near the temple of Preah Vihear, the surrounding area of which is claimed by both countries. Regrettably, there have been fatal casualties on both sides, and more than 3 000 people living close to the conflict area have had to be evacuated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 1962, the United Nations International Court of Justice, acting in accordance with French historical maps, recognised Cambodia’s rights over the temple of Preah Vihear and the land adjacent to it. However, Thailand has never accepted that decision. What is more, some parts of the border have not been demarcated, a situation which already caused several armed incidents in 2008 and 2009.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2008, UNESCO listed the temple as a World Heritage site, which also provoked anger among Thai nationalists. Although a memorandum of understanding on the demarcation of land boundary was signed in 2000, Thailand’s PAD nationalists are calling for it to be revoked because they feel it is too favourable towards Cambodia. I should like in particular to highlight the action taken by Indonesia, the current chair of ASEAN, which has offered to play the role of mediator in this conflict.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On Monday 14 February, the UN also urged the two countries to observe a permanent ceasefire, while it made no plans to send UN peacekeepers to the area. I hope that these two countries will finally be able to settle this land issue peacefully and to stop taking thousands of people wishing to live in peace hostage in this way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for us in the European Union, the idea of taking military action over border disputes is now thankfully unimaginable. However, this is sadly not the case on the border between Thailand and Cambodia, whose armies have clashed several times in the past couple of weeks over a disputed, tiny, part of their border near to an ancient temple.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aid agencies report that some 30 000 people have been displaced by the fighting, so it is hardly surprising in such circumstances that innocent civilians have been killed, although both sides contest the actual numbers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cambodia’s Prime Minister, Hun Sen, has referred to the clashes as a ‘real war’. Such bellicose and incendiary rhetoric can only make matters worse. The short-term solution to this dispute lies in the hands of both governments and the UN Security Council, which should take the lead in imposing solutions to de-escalate the crisis. In the longer term it is to be hoped that further ASEAN regional integration will help to make such clashes a thing of the past, as has been the case here in the EU for decades.</p>

Extremely tense relations have developed between the two neighbouring nations and I believe that this is the reason why the debate we are having today is welcome. I would actually like to thank Mr Posselt for the initiative he came up with.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also like to say that I too deplore the human losses resulting from the armed clashes since the start of the month. Especially in the current charged atmosphere, we must firmly ask both sides to act with the utmost restraint and comply with the request from the UN Security Council to establish a lasting truce. Whatever the source of disagreement between Thailand and Cambodia, resorting to force is not a solution. I therefore wish to appeal to both sides to find an urgent peaceful solution to the territorial dispute in the area around the temple of Preah Vihear.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must actually remind you that an unequivocal decision was made by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and that there are ample opportunities for resolving the dispute, including via mediation through ASEAN.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the 11th-century temple of Preah Vihear has many times been the scene of clashes between the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as the Khmer Rouge army and the regime of Lon Nol. Since the beginning of the 20th century , the temple has been the subject of a dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, who each in turn claim the right to the building and the surrounding terrain as well as the right to establish the border between the two countries. We have been witnessing the latest developments in this dispute since the beginning of February this year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled that the temple belongs to Cambodia, there are other questions which still have to be decided. Both governments should make every effort to find a compromise which will provide the foundation for a permanent agreement. A repeat of the conflict of a week and a half ago, when the armies of both countries shelled each other, is unacceptable both from the point of view of the people of the region, who are in danger of being killed, and from that of the temple, which, despite its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list, has sustained damage. UNESCO has already offered its help, as has the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Today, the European Parliament has joined the appeal. A ticket to gain entry to the temple of Preah Vihear costs five dollars. I would like to ask what the price is of the conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, which has lasted for over 100 years.</p>

This conflict, as has been rightly emphasised, in fact has a history of over a century. However, it is good that the European Union and the European Parliament, which is in fact the heart of the Union, has something to say on this matter. It is good, because we should be present wherever there is debate about human rights, wherever there is debate about this most important matter, and this conflict most certainly shows that people have died and are fighting today, although not with such deadly results, about matters which perhaps could be decided in a more peaceful way.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, in the International Court of Justic ruling of 15 June 1962, it was decided that the Preah Vihear temple falls within the sovereignty of Cambodia. It is the obligation of the Thai Government to respect this fact and to refrain from attempting to change the internationally recognized boundaries through military force. At the same time, the Cambodian government is obliged to allow access to this temple to worshippers from Thailand.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In a situation where one of the parties to a dispute is inclined to go beyond the rules and to impose its interests by force, it is necessary to mobilise international institutions in order to convey a clear verbal message that the world wishes to live under stable political conditions and does not wish to see disputes settled through the use of military force.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore necessary to mobilise the relevant international institutions locally, in order to prevent the spread of unnecessary conflict and trauma to the civilian population.

I think this thoughtlessness may mean the destruction of a building which has lasted since the 11th century.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Above all, however, I think this example should raise the question of responsibility. There must not be a repeat of what happened in Afghanistan in 2001, when a unique statue of Buddha was destroyed. This was the result, not only of the religious fanaticism of the Taliban, but also of the lack of sufficient commitment from western countries. The destruction of the world’s cultural heritage must not go unpunished. This is such an important matter, that by analogy with the International Criminal Court in The Hague which tries war criminals, an institution should also be established which tries and brings to justice people who destroy priceless monuments.</p>

In 1976, as ASEAN members, Cambodia and Thailand signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which commits them to rejecting the use of force in relations between member states and to the peaceful settlement of interstate disputes.

I should stress that a decision made by the International Court of Justice in 1962 confirmed that this monument belongs to Cambodia, and the authorities must respect this decision.

      <p sl="en">The points raised by the Parliament’s draft resolution were discussed on 14 February 2011 in the United Nations Security Council, in the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia, the latter in its capacity as current chair of ASEAN.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree with the conclusions of UN Under-Secretary Pascoe that the situation is indeed serious. The issue is not only about a world heritage site. It is also about – perceived or real – national and cultural identities and national pride. Most importantly, the issue is about human lives and about regional stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are two questions: what can the region do to redress the situation, and how can the EU contribute to a peaceful settlement? It is obvious that this kind of conflict cannot be solved by armed force. ASEAN has a role to play, and we are pleased to see that ASEAN is assuming its responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Indonesian Foreign Minister has rightly invoked the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. This agreement requires all parties to settle their differences by peaceful means. We welcome the decision by Indonesia to convene a special ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ meeting on this subject on 22 February 2011 in Jakarta.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is broad agreement in the United Nations on not letting this issue get out of hand. Members of the Security Council have called on both parties to refrain from provocation and from deploying military reinforcements along the border.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is becoming clear that regional efforts offer the most promising avenue for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. For the EU, this implies giving full support to ASEAN.</p>
      <p sl="en">The External Action Service is following the matter in detail and will be considering options for supporting ASEAN, if such support is appropriate and is requested from their side.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I look with great admiration at the courage of citizens who defy the repression and violence of their governments. We have seen this happening in popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Iran, Algeria, Bahrain and also in Yemen. The young generation wants hope to replace cynicism, opportunities to replace poverty, justice to replace impunity and internet freedom to replace repression and censorship.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a long list of serious concerns about developments in Yemen in relation to democracy, human rights and the independence of the judiciary, as well as to the persecution of journalists, bloggers and human rights defenders. In particular, we are concerned about the climate of fear that is created by the execution of juveniles, despite Yemen’s commitment to the international community not to execute juvenile offenders and the reflection of that commitment in its own penal code.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a lack of adequate means to determine the age of defendants, so it is difficult for people to defend themselves. We call on the President of Yemen and the authorities to at least respect Yemen’s own laws and commitments to the international community and halt the execution of juveniles. We also stress the need for reforms in Yemen, as called for by so many demonstrators in the streets, and we want their living conditions and their rights to be improved.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Arab countries are being rocked by a wave of popular uprisings that are spreading to them all, one by one, and I hope that this will continue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">An unprecedented wave of protest against the dictatorships in power in those countries is gaining ground. These dictatorships are in place more often than not with the support and, at best, amid the silence of all of the Western regimes. No country seems immune to popular uprisings, and that is all to the good. We took too long – you took too long – to realise what was happening in those countries, and you are still delaying now. It took until 2 February for the European Parliament to adopt a resolution on Tunisia, and it is only now, at this part-session, that we have adopted one on Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We had requested, in connection with these emergency situations, a resolution on Algeria. Our request was refused once again, just as, for months, you – or at least the vast majority of you – refused to see what was happening in Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, protest movements are being formed, as we speak, in Iran, in Libya, with regard to which you have just given your support – your conditional support, but your support nonetheless – to a partnership agreement, and also in Bahrain and in Yemen, to mention only those that we know the most about. Yes, that is right, in Yemen, where President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for no fewer than 33 years. Talk about a managed democracy! Of course, it is much better than the situation in Libya, since Mr Gaddafi has been in power for 42 years!</p>
      <p sl="fr">We were among the few who said that we could not vote today on a resolution on Yemen without taking account of what was happening in that country. Men and women there are fighting for their freedom. Violence is erupting between supporters and opponents of the regime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the rallies began at the end of January, hundreds of people have been injured. Yesterday in Aden, a young demonstrator was shot dead during clashes with the police, who opened fire to disperse a gathering. Right now, students in Saada are barricaded inside their campus, where they are still surrounded by the police, and we remain silent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we think of Yemen, we think only of the problem of capital punishment for minors. I am by no means suggesting that the abolition of the death penalty should be abandoned – I have always been a staunch supporter of its abolition, and I believe that any supposedly democratic country that is incapable of abolishing such a punishment is criminal and should not lecture others on democracy and human rights, even if it is the world’s leading power.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, this capital punishment is even more unacceptable when it is applied to minors, especially in a country where it is impossible to know for sure when a person was born and where this impossibility is used to sentence people to death, the benefit of the doubt being given, dare I say it, because of the failure to establish their date of birth and so prove that they were minors at the time of the offence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">And you would like us to adopt a resolution focusing on just one issue, a resolution that merely emphasises, in paragraph seven, the need for reforms, as called for by, I quote, ‘so many demonstrators’? That is a bit weak.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, I and my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have tabled three amendments to update this resolution, and I hope that, together, we will be able to adopt a resolution worthy of the name.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I want to assure Mrs Vergiat that, as anyone can see, we are debating not only the death penalty, but also the events taking place recently on the streets of Yemen. I believe that when it comes to the vote, she will also be able to see what stance our group adopts on these issues.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, we must not forget that the subject of the emergency resolution which was adopted to be discussed today is the persecution of juvenile criminals and the imposition of the death penalty in this case. As you are aware, if we Europeans find the death penalty unacceptable and barbaric, it is even more awful and terrible when juveniles are involved. The bottom line is that the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by an offender under the age of 18 even violates Yemeni legislation, although the authorities in this country continue to carry out such executions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the topic of the urgent resolution is important in itself. I too want to call on the President of Yemen to halt the execution of Thabet Samoum, as well as to call on him and the authorities to commute the death sentence passed on him and other juveniles such as Ali Abdulla.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as has been said, it would be unfortunate to miss this opportunity and not raise some of the basic and more important issues that are emerging now in that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I would also like to see Parliament add, at the end of the resolution on which we will be voting, that it notes that in Yemen as in other Arab countries, notably Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent weeks to demand more democracy and reforms of the state.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘Whereas many protestors have been attacked or taken into custody by the security forces’: that is our first amendment. Secondly: ‘expresses its deep concern about the long-standing political and socio-economic problems in Yemen and calls for considerable efforts by the international community to prevent the escalation of the current crisis’. Finally, our third amendment: ‘expresses its solidarity with the demonstrators who demand democratic reforms and improved living conditions; welcomes in this context President Saleh’s announcement that he will step down in 2013 and calls on the authorities to stop violence against peaceful protestors and to release all demonstrators who express their dissent peacefully’.</p>
      <p sl="en">If all three of these amendments are included, the resolution would be really very good.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the death penalty is truly the most inhumane punishment possible and I have appealed against it on countless occasions. Indeed, the European Parliament has made appeals for its abolition in the countries which still retain this barbaric practice.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the executions in Yemen referred to in our resolution are especially outrageous as juveniles are involved. Even before a crime has been committed, the victims are children. This therefore violates the fundamental right to life, as well as the international conventions which Yemen is party to and, last but not least, even the penal code in this country, which explicitly forbids the use of capital punishment against juvenile offenders. The difficulty in determining the exact age of those convicted due to the lack of birth certificates is a circumstance which increases the discretionary nature of this type of punishment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We cannot discuss this specific issue without taking into account the state of affairs in Yemen. The Yemeni authorities are violating human rights. Journalists and activists are being imprisoned illegally. Women are discriminated against regarding their participation in public life and access to education, while the judicial system is anything but independent. The recent riots are not only motivated by economic and social concerns, but they also express the strong desire to make Yemeni society democratic.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Yemen is a state party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which expressly prohibit the execution of juvenile offenders – those convicted of crimes committed when the perpetrators were under the age of 18.</p>
      <p sl="en">The impending execution of Muhammed Samoum, and indeed the detention on death row of several other juvenile offenders, is an affront to international law. By pursuing such policies, on the bizarre excuses of the accused not having proper birth certificates or of uncertainty about their age, Yemen is aligning itself with the brutal theocracy of Iran. However, the difference between the two countries is that Yemen receives massive aid from the West, including the EU, in order to root out al-Qaeda terrorists, whereas Iran is an international pariah.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we have considerable leverage here in the EU over President Ali Abdullah Saleh. I urge the High Representative to take all possible steps to persuade him to grant clemency in this case. Having announced that he will shortly relinquish his post, President Saleh has a real chance now to leave a positive and enlightened legacy in his country, which has been brutalised by conflict and terrorism for so long and now dreams of a democratic future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the use of capital punishment on juveniles under the age of 15 was prohibited in Yemen in 1991. Since 1994, this ban has applied to people below the age of 18. Unfortunately, this prohibition is not always respected in practice, for example in the case of people who do not have any documents which confirm their age, as has already been mentioned in this Chamber. Other dangerous things are also happening in Yemen. It is a country where the number of weapons has long ago exceeded the number of people, where brutal tribal battles are a daily occurrence and where teenagers with weapons do not cause a stir. There is even a saying in Yemen that ‘if you are old enough to use a knife, you are old enough to fight for your tribe’. Besides, everyone who has been to Yemen knows that almost everyone carries a knife, and a teenager with a Kalashnikov is nothing unusual. Yemeni society is also a very young society – almost half of Yemenis are still under 14. The different militias recruit young soldiers, and we should also fight against this.</p>

I would like to say that the call for Yemen not to carry out the death sentence on juveniles is an example of the European Union’s characteristic minimalist approach. I am opposed to capital punishment, though I know that in this Chamber there are people who support it, although they do not say so publically. I am opposed to capital punishment, irrespective of whether it concerns a juvenile person or an adult. However, on this particular question I hope we are going to rise above our national and political divisions to demand unequivocally from the authorities in Yemen that on this matter the President of Yemen should make use, after all, of his right to grant a pardon. This really is a question of a truly united fight.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Yemeni administration has made a commitment to accept the application of both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Both of the cases of condemned juvenile offenders are subject to the regime of these documents, and it should therefore not be possible for a judicial body in Yemen to issue a legal decision denying the rights and protection arising from these documents.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Penalties imposed in violation of the valid commitments of a country, and hence the applicable law, cannot be accepted. If the Yemeni Government claims that its power is based on civilized democratic principles, then it cannot use barbaric forms of governance based on arbitrariness and injustice. In my opinion, we should make this fact clear to the Yemeni Government today.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally I believe that it is important that here in the European Parliament we condemn dictatorial means, that we condemn dictators and dictatorships, but I also believe that it is important that we urge Yemen in general towards democratic structures. However, I think that, although this Yemen affair has been raised in the European Parliament, it is not the European Union’s job to adopt a position on this. This affair is totally confused. There are totally unclarified circumstances in it. Even the particulars of the crime cannot be made out satisfactorily. For one thing, we do not even know how old the young man accused and convicted of the crime was at the time the offence was committed. It is possible that he was not a minor. We do not see clearly in this case. Nothing illustrates Yemen’s astonishing backwardness better than the fact that not even the birth certificate of Mohammed Taher Thabet Samoum has surfaced. Neither has it been proven to this day whether his school papers presented by his lawyer are genuine or whether these are false school papers. Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not about stealing a hen but this is a case of murder, and so here I prefer to be a little restrained and more measured than the speakers so far.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union must consider, similarly to the world’s other democratic countries such as the United States of America, the option of the death penalty for certain exceptionally serious crimes proven beyond doubt.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Samoum case is not a one-off event in Yemen: at least eight other juvenile offenders are in custody awaiting a death sentence. This is especially challenging in a country where there are no birth records, so it is impossible to say with any certainty whether someone was underage in a situation when a crime was committed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is nevertheless important to remember that the state of Yemen is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which expressly prohibit the death sentence against juvenile offenders and harsh sentences in general for such people. The execution of juvenile offenders is, furthermore, forbidden in Yemen’s own penal code.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to say that the death penalty is always cruel, inhuman, and a punishment that strips a person of human dignity. For that reason, the EU will fight against the death penalty in all situations, and we too in this House will appeal in favour of that.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, sentencing a child to death is unacceptable in the world we live in. Turning this practice into a habit is a crime in itself. This is why I want to express my disagreement with the decision made by the Yemeni authorities to continue such actions. The government is violating both the international treaties on this matter and the penal code which prohibits the use of the death penalty for juveniles. In addition, the way in which the justice system tries to find out the age of those brought before it remains unclear. This case is a sad example of what is going on in Yemen.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As an MEP and citizen of the EU, I believe in the fundamental importance of a person’s right to life, and children must be the first to be protected. I appeal to the EU’s High Representative to halt the succession of these bloody executions.</p>

They received their sentence years ago and it may be carried out at any time. They are being subjected to huge psychological strain, which is inhumane and degrading treatment in itself. We call on the authorities to refrain from carrying out these punishments.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, neither offender can prove that they were under the age of 18 because they do not have birth certificates. Obtaining a birth certificate is a serious problem in Yemen where only 22% of births are officially registered, according to UNICEF. Some of the funds we use to help this country will perhaps resolve this problem. Public discussion about these cases must lead to the abolition of capital punishment in Yemen and to the sentences of hundreds of people condemned to death being commuted. I call on the European Commission and Council to insist on achieving this objective in the dialogue with this government.</p>

In Belarus, sentences of capital punishment are still imposed and the death sentence is still in use.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is happening in Yemen must attract our attention and we must make the loudest appeals to the Yemeni Government to put an immediate stop to these awful practices, and also to look into the fact that – as my fellow Member said a moment ago – there are still a number of juveniles in prison awaiting execution.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the decision in Yemen to impose the death penalty on someone who was a minor at the time of the offence is shocking. Yemen has clearly acted unlawfully here, since like nearly every country in the world Yemen is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Under Article 37 of the Convention, neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment may be imposed for crimes committed by persons before their 18th birthday. This decision has been justified by the claim that the age of the accused is uncertain.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, death sentences are also passed against minors in other parts of the Islamic world. Sharia courts are imposing capital punishment on youths in Somalia, for example. Together with the UN, the EU must act more resolutely and more speedily here to prevent breaches of international law with such serious consequences. Dialogue is good, but Realpolitik and economic pressure are better ways to advance our argument. At any rate, they tend to get things moving much faster.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Union, in implementing its well-established Death Penalty Guidelines, has long been active in fighting the death penalty in Yemen, both generally and by targeting individual cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">The capital punishment of juvenile offenders has always taken place in Yemen. In earlier times, however, cases were largely unknown and civil society was not as active. The EU-funded and UNICEF-implemented Juvenile Justice Programme has contributed significantly to raising awareness, both in Yemen and within the international community. This programme was carried out together with a coalition of civil society organisations and the Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, awareness-raising is not enough. We need to follow up with actions. As a last resort, the EU delegation actively carries out démarches to halt executions. The two most recent cases were in December 2010 for Fuad Ahmed Ali Abdulla, and in January 2011 for Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum. In both cases, the execution was halted – after EU intervention – to allow for presentation of evidence of age. The issue of Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum was taken up again last week. It seems now as if a presidential pardon is the only hope for a formal reversal of the sentence. The EU and UNICEF have again contacted President Saleh and now, according to our own feedback from Sana’a, the execution is on hold again.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yemen is bound by international obligations, and by its own juvenile justice legislation and penal code, not to execute juveniles. The reasons for having juveniles on death row are mainly attributed to a lack of capacity in age determination. We are therefore, together with UNICEF, looking into how to assist Yemen in building up such expertise, so as to arrest the issue at its roots. In the immediate term, the EU will encourage the setting up of an independent body to re-examine the age of juvenile offenders. We will also aim to support the capacities of lawyers to provide legal assistance to juveniles. In the medium-term, we are looking to develop EU support for an effective civil registry authority.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are thus taking this extremely grave issue very seriously and using all available means. The Government of Yemen has shown receptiveness to our démarches. The EU remains prepared to assist them, now and in the future, to achieve our goal of eradicating the death penalty totally.</p>

      <p sl="fi">We have frequently addressed the subject of the death penalty in our resolutions. Condemning minors to death is rare, but Yemen is one of those countries in which it has happened. Although Yemen has made progress in its efforts to prohibit death sentences against minors, courts have continued to pass them. The case of Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum is not the only one.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Generally speaking, and in connection with intercultural dialogue, it is worth giving serious consideration to what radicalises young people, prompting them to commit crime, even murder, and how best to prevent them from going down the road of crime. As is known, the death sentence does not reduce crime.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The pro-democracy demonstrations that began in Tunisia and Egypt have received much support from the local youth. The lack of prospects and opportunities, in addition to a desire for democracy, has provoked resistance. This wave of resistance also spread to Yemen last week.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I share my fellow Members’ concerns and demands with respect to Samoum and others who have received the death sentence. Although we are now waiting with interest and hope to see what political changes the demonstrations in the Arab countries will lead to, we cannot for a moment close our eyes to outrages which contravene international human rights agreements, such as the death sentence for minors.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am pleased that we have succeeded in bringing about agreement between six political groups in this resolution to condemn the murder of David Kato and to call on the authorities, the new political leadership that will be elected in Uganda tomorrow and also religious leaders to bring to an end once and for all the persecution of and violence against lesbian and gay people and against other minorities, and to contribute to enabling lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to live freely in Uganda too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Here in the European Union we also have a responsibility to work for such equal rights and to honour the memory of David Kato and others who sacrificed their lives before him in the fight for equal rights. To this end it is also essential that Baroness Ashton – our High Representative for Foreign Affairs – and the new European External Action Service work for these same equal rights; for example, in order that the Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) People is also used in all non-European countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we have an urgent resolution on LGBT rights in Uganda for the third time in this parliamentary term. The previous two were warnings and attempts to prevent what happened to David Kato, the human rights activist who was brutally murdered.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must condemn LGBT discrimination across the world, including in Europe and even in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The murder of David Kato is a crime that needs to be fully and impartially investigated. Not only do the perpetrators have to be brought to justice, but the broader context of intolerance, discrimination and threats to LGBT people needs to be analysed, and changed. Local publication Rolling Stone and Ugandan parliamentarians have played a role of incitement rather than one of protecting citizens. Since David Kato’s murder, the authorities have been too silent.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has put the rights of LBGT people on the agenda over and over again and, with the support of all Members of this House, we have urged respect for their human rights – because that is what LGBT rights are – and we will not be silent.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that those Members who are sometimes hesitant or even reluctant to stand up for gay rights will think again and realise that killing people is never justified and that it needs to be met with our ongoing and unequivocal condemnation, just as we address the violations of the rights of other minorities across the world, such as Christians.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission and the External Action Service need to use the toolkit to promote, and protect the enjoyment of, the rights of LGBT people to the full extent with regard to Uganda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the murder of David Kato is the direct result of the hatred and hostility towards Uganda’s LGBT community, whipped up by certain hard-line parliamentarians in that country. Twice in the past year we have lambasted the outrageous attempts by some MPs in Uganda to mandate the death penalty for the so-called crime of same-sex activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is inevitable that in a climate of such bigotry the lives of gay rights activists would be endangered, and so it has sadly proved to be the case with David Kato. He knew the risks of publicly defending gays. He and other alleged homosexuals were outed last year by a newspaper which printed their photos next to a headline which said, disgracefully, ‘hang them’. I am sure that many of my London constituents are deeply concerned about the European Union giving financial aid to a country where such disgusting sentiments are not only tolerated but sometimes apparently officially condoned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that Parliament’s Delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament will consider carefully what action it can take to register our anger and disgust at Mr Kato’s murder and, more generally, to underline that the EU’s continuing engagement and financial aid to African countries must be reciprocated with progress on fundamental human rights on that continent.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we are now on to the third European Parliament resolution of this parliamentary term on discrimination against the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) population in Uganda. Today we are dealing specifically with the case of Mr David Kato, whose killing has been strongly denounced by many NGOs and international bodies. Mr Kato was, in fact, a symbol of the fight against homophobia in his country, and more specifically of the denunciation of the Bahati bill, which goes very far in cracking down on homosexuality, since it envisages sentences right up to life imprisonment and even the death penalty. We must pay tribute to him, but we must also think of all those whose photographs, names and addresses have been publicly disgraced by a rag whose name I shall not even mention. The climate with regard to the LGBT community is unacceptable, exacerbated as it is by the religious authorities and in particular by the evangelist fundamentalists close to the Head of State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Tomorrow, presidential elections will take place in Uganda. Although there are eight candidates, the outgoing President has already declared himself certain of his re-election and announced that he will imprison anyone who protests against the elections. Those elections are undoubtedly an opportunity to remind Uganda of its human rights obligations, to tell it that the fight against discrimination of any kind, including against LGBTs, is an integral part of these universal values and that we should together respond to Mr Ban Ki-moon’s appeal to make the decriminalisation of homosexuality a universal fight for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for those of us who live in the developed world, the chasm between us and the sub-Saharan area both in terms of thinking and practice is very difficult to comprehend.</p>
      <p sl="en">The case of David Kato is an example of that. He was a man who was regarded as the father of the Ugandan human rights movement. As a founder member of SMUG, Sexual Minorities Uganda, he was condemned by a magazine called Rolling Stone , and won his case against them. The editor said that the persecution of homosexuals and their execution should continue. Sure enough, David Kato was murdered, on 26 January.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is always a sad moment when we have to pass a resolution on the death of a human rights defender.</p>
      <p sl="en">For me it is even sadder because, like others in this House, I met him when he came to Parliament to plead for it to act on behalf of those living in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a gay man, can I personally thank this House for the way it has united in this resolution in saying that hatred against lesbian, gay and bisexual people, and the diminishing of their human rights, is totally unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The justice that we can give David Kato is not only to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice for the crime that they have committed – the senseless murder of this young man. The real issue is that in the continent of Africa, as Mr Tannock quite rightly said, on issues of human rights and civil liberties, we have given our colleagues too far and too easy a ride on these vital matters. The best thing that can come from this is that the colonialism that we imposed through our laws, and sometimes through our religion, can actually end in the repeal of the law in the 38 countries that criminalise homosexuality and bring to an end the death penalty in Somalia, Mauritania, Sudan and Northern Nigeria.</p>
      <p sl="en">That would be a memorial not only to David Kato, a giant amongst the pygmies who preach prejudice and persecution. It would also be a memorial to this Parliament speaking up for those who have no voice.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I truly believe that the discussion about the violation of the rights of sexual minorities in Uganda ought to go further than voicing criticism. We should reflect on the effectiveness of our measures supporting human rights and examine the level of contribution from European diplomacy towards this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In December, we adopted a resolution against the punishment of homosexual persons in Uganda and the incitement to crimes against a community stigmatised for its sexual orientation. I abhor this awful crime, but at the same time, I also abhor the reluctance of European institutions and European Union Member States to resort to the tools of persuasion and pressure which they have available. I believe that it is appropriate for us to firmly request the Ugandan authorities to guarantee respect for fundamental rights, conduct a fair investigation into this case and prevent other such crimes. I also think that we need to issue a warning to the Commission for it to become involved much more actively in defending human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we will pass our third resolution against the criminalisation of homosexuality in Uganda. Within a short space of time gay people have been declared fair game in Uganda. Even children or minors are affected. This is all due to the irresponsible actions of a US-based Christian sect and the call by local newspaper Rolling Stone for a hundred people whom it named as being gay to be hanged.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now David Kato – one such person publicly named as being gay – has been hammered to a pulp on a public street; this is, in fact, what we were hoping to prevent with our last resolution. We call on Uganda firstly to hold an independent investigation into the murder of David Kato and not to arrest just anybody for the crime. Further, we call on Uganda to prosecute those who call for the public murder of gay people. We also call on Uganda to revise its legislation.</p>

      <p sl="es">In Africa homosexuality is only legal in 13 countries, and in 38 countries it is considered a crime. This is unacceptable and, moreover, as the European Union we must fight it both politically and economically. We should not forget that finally we also have the opportunity to contribute, from an economic point of view, to combating this type of measure.</p>
      <p sl="es">Persecution on the grounds of sexual orientation also needs to be considered as an essential element of the basis for applying for refugee status, and for the right to protection from the European Union and from the Member States that, unfortunately, do not currently grant that right.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I think a situation in which we are talking about Uganda for the third time in 14 months and for the second time in only a few months is one which is very disturbing. I agree with previous speakers that in fact this is not about the human rights of just one group, but it is about human rights in Uganda in general as all minorities there are facing extreme challenges. I think it is particularly important for the European Parliament to speak again on this matter. I welcome the fact that the representatives of different political groups are speaking together on this matter and are, in fact, speaking with one voice, although of course they may have different emphases. Human rights are not respected at all in Uganda, especially the rights of this group. We should therefore protect this group in particular. We should also defend the right to unhindered political activity and we should also stress, in this context, the rights of human rights defenders.</p>

Even if the murderer is punished, the atmosphere of hatred will still remain, sanctioned by the law which discriminates against LGBT people. Homosexuality is a crime in as many as 38 African countries, and in four of those countries it carries the death sentence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union actively supports democratic change in Africa. We must not allow human rights to be violated in such a drastic way. How much blood must still be shed, how many more people have to die before the international community can force a change in legislation in Africa which violates human rights? It is also necessary to examine the role of the Church, which instead of promoting love and peace, is promoting hatred against homosexual people, teaching the ridiculous theory that homosexuality is a serious illness which needs to be treated.</p>

I think that while we are on the subject we should also talk about the language of hatred and what it can produce. For ultimately it was the language of hatred (the tabloid which published photographs of Mr Kato) which led to this horrendous murder. The language of hatred is also in use here in the European Union. There are Internet sites such as Redwatch, and on these sites the names and sometimes even the addresses are given of people who have a different sexual orientation, a different religion or a different world-view. In fact, on these Internet sites violence is openly incited against minorities.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start by paying tribute to the late David Kato. David Kato was a courageous human rights defender and fearless LGTB rights activist.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a leading voice on LGTB rights, his life was under threat. On 2 October 2010, David Kato’s name and picture, along with the names and pictures of other alleged LGBT persons, were published by a Ugandan tabloid, the Rolling Stone , under the headline ‘Hang them’, shamelessly putting their lives at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was a success that he won an appeal against the paper. On 3 January, a court ruled that the paper had violated their constitutional rights to privacy and safety and awarded the three plaintiffs damages.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was his last success. On 26 January, David Kato was killed. The EU, through its heads of mission in Uganda, expressed its shock and called on the Ugandan authorities to investigate David Kato’s murder vigorously and to ensure that the perpetrators of this terrible act were brought to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">David Kato will be a great loss to the global community of human rights defenders and to Uganda. His death also reminds us of the volatile situation for LGBT people in Uganda and elsewhere. Right after his death, on 28 January, another paper, Red Pepper , published an outrageous article with very insulting statements about homosexuals. The draft anti-homosexuality bill put before the Ugandan parliament has been temporarily shelved, but can be re-tabled once a new parliament is established after the upcoming elections in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU position on LGTB rights is very clear. The criminalisation of homosexuality, as foreseen in the draft Uganda bill, goes against international human rights standards. The draft bill also goes against the EU-supported United Nations Declaration on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity of 18 December 2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU heads of mission have raised this issue with the Ugandan Government on several occasions at the highest level: with the President, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice and the Uganda Human Rights Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 9 February, the Human Rights Working Group, which brings together several partners in Uganda, invited human rights defenders to give an update on actions undertaken by the LGBT – and broader human rights defenders’ – community, following David’s murder.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 3 February, the EU Delegation, together with ten EU Member States represented in Uganda and Norway, launched the Local Implementation Strategy on the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. The strategy set out, in a more practical way, how EU missions and Norway can work to assist and acknowledge the work of human rights defenders, including LGBT activists.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU intends to keep raising its concerns in relation to the draft anti-homosexuality bill and other cases of the persecution of LGBT people in Uganda on every suitable occasion, in dialogue with the government. In addition, the EU will continue to support local human rights organisations in their efforts to change attitudes in the country. The EU delegation will shortly meet with a protection organisation for human rights defenders to discuss ways of supporting their work for LGTB activists.</p>

The murder of David Kato Kisule proves that there is both a major and real danger that hate and discrimination will cost human lives. I welcome the statements made by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hilary Clinton who condemned David Kato Kisule’s death and highlighted his efforts to establish a life of dignity in Uganda, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity.

The martyrdom of David Kato and the discrimination against the LGBT minorities should be addressed vocally with the Ugandan authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Uganda must fulfil her obligations under international law and the Cotonou Agreement, which commits Uganda to protect all persons, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, against threats and violence. It would be a serious infringement if the Ugandan government and judiciary were to encourage and exercise such violence themselves.
