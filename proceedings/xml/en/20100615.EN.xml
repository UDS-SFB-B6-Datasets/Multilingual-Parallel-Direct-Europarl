      <p sl="unknown">The first item on the agenda is the report by Mrs Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/15/EC on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities (COM(2008)0650 – C6-0354/2008 – 2008/0195(COD)) (A7-0137/2010).</p>

      <p sl="hu">The proposal put forward is intended to amend Directive 2002/15/EC in connection with social protection. The Commission’s proposal touches on three issues: the exemption of self-employed hauliers from the scope of the law, the provision of a more precise definition for night work and support for the application of the law. The directive itself and, hence, its amendment, are supplementary in nature and only apply to vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, like other laws applicable to road transport activities. Therefore, it could not extend to drivers of smaller commercial vehicles. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted against the amendment (30 to 19 votes).</p>
      <p sl="hu">Several misapprehensions arose while the law was being drafted. I would like to address a few of those which may have influenced MEPs. First of all, experts have reached the unanimous conclusion that if the Commission’s proposal is rejected, resulting in the directive’s scope being extended to also include self-employed hauliers, it will not improve road safety. Available statistical data and studies on accidents show that only 6% of accidents are caused by the fault of lorry drivers, and fatigue is cited as a reason in only 0.06% of cases. Also, driving time, which has a real effect on road safety, is regulated by a different act of law, Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, which also applies to self-employed hauliers. Loading time is of a supplementary nature and cannot be regarded as a significant part of working time, as the law does not apply, for instance, to journeys under 100 km. Secondly, trade unions fear that self-employed hauliers could even work up to 86 hours if they are not regulated.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The regulation includes stringent rules on driving time. It is capped at 45 hours per week for any two consecutive weeks, not to exceed 56 hours in any single week. This is accurately recorded by digital tachographs and the regulation also includes detailed rules on rest periods. Therefore, the claim of a possible 86-hour working week is an assumption not supported by any statistical data, study or survey. Thirdly, the Commission’s proposal would limit the scope of the directive to employees and false self-employed hauliers. So far, there has been no law regulating the working time of self-employed entrepreneurs. Working time restriction is an important means for the social protection of employees. However, in the case of self-employed hauliers, the employer and the employee are the same person, and protecting private transporters from themselves is an extreme measure. Fourthly, when the arguments run out, the real reason is revealed: social dumping. Do not be confused by the term, because self-employed hauliers and small enterprises can also be unpleasant competitors on the market, just like self-employed hauliers arriving from new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">My experience is, unfortunately, that the case of the phantom Polish plumber has returned to haunt us. I would like to move on to talk about a common labour market phenomenon that should not be dealt with, and indeed cannot be dealt with exclusively in the field of road transport. This is the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs, which is a real European problem with adverse effects on competition and the labour market. This is the issue that needs to be addressed, and this expectation was stated clearly in the proposed amendment.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Proposed Amendment 30, tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is based on the Commission’s proposal and is supported by the Council, and I would like to thank the Council for their support. We will vote on the amendment section by section. I would like to add one more thing. As a compromise solution, we recommend allowing each Member State to extend the scope of the directive to self-employed hauliers, if they want to.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today, this House is discussing an extremely difficult and sensitive subject. The question is whether or not entrepreneurs who are self-employed drivers should be covered by the directive on the working time of mobile workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inclusion of entrepreneurs would be a precedent and a clear deviation from the general Working Time Directive. This directive only regulates the working time of employed workers, not of entrepreneurs. Discussions about the inclusion of self-employed drivers have been going on for a long time. Firstly, consultations between social partners in the 1990s did not yield any result. Then, the legislator could not reach a conclusion after four years of discussion – between 1998 and 2002 – and therefore asked the Commission for a thorough impact study. The Commission has now carried out studies and made an impact assessment which clearly demonstrates that this directive is not the right tool to address transport policy issues such as road safety or competition conditions, but that enforcement in respect of the non self-employed is a real issue. This is also the sense of the Commission proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I wish to express my deep respect for your rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, who has done an excellent job. I am very glad to see that the rapporteur shares the Commission’s concern over the weak enforcement of the rules and the general problem of false self-employment, and I appreciate Mrs Bauer’s constructive proposals. I believe that the rapporteur’s proposed amendments have the potential to protect employees even better against possible exploitation by employers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where Europe definitely needs action is in respect of so-called false self-employed drivers – that is, those drivers who are formally independent but, in practice, are employed by a single company which gives them orders and pays them. Both the Commission proposal and the amendments proposed by the rapporteur give a clear message to industry: the phenomenon of false self-employment will not be tolerated and the legislator will be vigilant in putting this rule into practice throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards road safety, let me stress that working time must not be mistaken for driving time. The situation regarding the latter has radically changed since 1998. As you know, this House, together with the Council, adopted new driving time rules, introduced modern, reliable digital recording equipment and adopted a specific directive on enforcement. Today’s debate is not on road safety. The statistics and the studies that the Commission has made available to Parliament give absolutely no indication that the inclusion of self-employed drivers would improve road safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">At a time when we hope to begin to recover from the economic crisis, it would not be a good move to impose an additional administrative and financial burden on small and fragile undertakings which have managed to survive the economic recession. Instead of imposing red tape on entrepreneurs, Europe needs a working time directive which will really ensure protection to those employed and dependent drivers who need that protection.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, my point of order concerns the code of conduct adopted by this Parliament in terms of ordinary legislative procedure negotiations. I fail to understand how the Commissioner can speak of an agreement with Parliament when he has spoken with only one single member, a member who basically had no mandate from the appropriate committee to negotiate what you are calling a sound agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her report and for her excellent work in recent months.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fundamental issue is whether or not the working hours of self-employed workers in the transport sector should be regulated for the first time. The Commission says not, nearly all the Member States say not, and the majority of my group also says not. If we were to include self-employed drivers in the directive, it would only serve the interests of big business. We need to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to tell those who cite shortcomings in road safety as justification for including self-employed workers that the rules on driving hours and rest times have long since been tightened up. All drivers – whether self-employed or employees – must take a minimum of 11 hours rest over a 24-hour period. That is why we have digital tachographs that automatically record driving hours, and the authorities monitor compliance with this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was the European Parliament’s rapporteur on tachographs at the time. I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for preventing the regulation being extended to vehicles weighing less than 3.5 tonnes. Digital EU control devices in all commercial vehicles would have resulted in time-consuming and expensive documentation obligations. We want to reduce bureaucracy, not increase it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore recommend that this House support the compromise that the rapporteur has reached with other groups.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the position of this group has been consistent throughout; my position as rapporteur has been consistent ever since 2002 when we first proposed the inclusion of self-employed and independent drivers. We remain convinced that that needs to be the case, and I very much hope therefore that the proposal to reject the Commission’s proposal will be agreed in the vote tomorrow, just as it was in plenary last spring and in the Employment Committee this March.</p>
      <p sl="en">We very much regret the confusion the rapporteur appears to have encountered in discharging her mandate. Rather than reflecting and promoting the clear majority views of members of the European Parliament’s Employment Committee, she has actively worked to promote the view of the Commission and Council. The other institutions, as Mme Berès has said, have shown not one gram of loyal cooperation but instead have gone out of their way to subvert the very clear Employment Committee recommendation to the plenary: the rejection of the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, a tired driver is a dangerous driver, irrespective of employment status; we should not make road travel any more of a gamble than it already is. Once again this morning, the rapporteur has shown confusion between the notions of driving time and working time. It is quite possible under the existing regime for a self-employed, a ‘false’ self-employed, driver, to drive between 86 and 95 hours per week; perhaps not every week, but one week is enough of a danger in itself. If the Commissioner doubts that figure, he can come to see me any time he likes; I have the figures from the people working in the sector. This is a fact. We must reject the Commission’s proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bauer for her hard work.</p>
      <p sl="de">The core issue we are dealing with here in this report is whether to include, or exclude, self-employed drivers from the Working Time Directive. It is crucial to remember that all drivers, employed or self-employed, come under the 2006 driving time regulations which regulate their driving time, their break times and their rest periods. Therefore, road safety matters are dealt with adequately under that directive, and, if anybody believes that they are not, then we need to look at the Driving Time Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is no data relating accidents to the working time of professional drivers and no data distinguishing between employed and self-employed drivers. Therefore, we have no data on a decision to include self-employed drivers. Legislation must be based on sound reliable data and all the scaremongering about self-employed drivers working 86 hours per week and causing accidents is just that: it is scaremongering and is not based on any reliable data.</p>
      <p sl="de">This legislation, if it includes self-employed, will be virtually unenforceable. Are we to have an army of inspectors looking over the shoulders of self-employed workers to see if they are performing general administrative duties or administration relating to the job under way? According to the legislation, working time includes when a self-employed person is at their work station. This is defined in the legislation as the main place of business of the undertaking, together with its various subsidiary places of business. Will the office located in the small bedroom or the attic of the self-employed driver’s home be defined as his work station, and who will police and enforce the legislation? Yes, there are issues relating to competition for self-employed, but this legislation will not deal with those matters. In fact, in my own country, we deal very effectively with this matter through the tax system.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, if we reject the Commission proposal, we will end up with bad law. It is disproportionate and will not achieve its aims, and it will pile further red tape and bureaucracy on already struggling SMEs in most countries and particularly in my own country, Ireland. It is unenforceable, and that makes an ass of the law.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter we are discussing today relates to an absolutely fundamental question: do we in the European Parliament want to ensure that we have a social Europe with fair competition and decent working conditions? Or will we allow the market and the laws of chance to reign in a transport industry that is coming more and more under pressure? For us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs here in Parliament, there is no doubt at all. We want self-employed drivers to be included in the Working Time Directive. Thus, we reject the Commission’s proposal to exclude self-employed drivers, for the following three reasons. Firstly, self-employed drivers need to be covered by working time regulations so that we can ensure traffic safety in Europe. With a lorry weighing a tonne behind them, it is absolutely essential to put a limit on their working time to avoid tired drivers and accidents. Secondly, we want to ensure fair competition within the transport industry. In recent years, we have seen an enormous growth in the number of ‘false’ self-employed drivers. This has been the industry’s solution to avoid the working time regulations. As legislators, we must not create incentives for there to be more self-employed drivers in Europe. Instead, we must ensure that there are uniform rules so that we create a level playing field. Thirdly, we want to ensure a good working environment for everyone. From EU studies, we know that self-employed drivers are sick more often and are more stressed than employed drivers. Is this a reasonable state of affairs from the point of view of health and safety? We do not think so.</p>
      <p sl="da">A great deal has been said about this directive, and many incorrect things have been said. I would like to dispel two myths. Firstly, there is the myth concerning administrative work. Office work does not form part of the regulation, and it is very important to establish that fact. We should bury this myth. Secondly, there is the myth concerning enforcement. I have heard my fellow Members say that it would not be possible to enforce this directive. To these Members, I would simply say that we have a digital tachograph that can provide the measurements. It currently does this for employed drivers, so clearly it can also do so for self-employed drivers.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would just like to say a few words to Mrs Bauer. As shadow rapporteur for the Greens, I have been very disappointed in how the process has been carried out recently. Mrs Bauer broke all the good rules of negotiation, she broke the ‘code of conduct’ of this House and now she is presenting what she calls a compromise. As far as I am concerned, this is her responsibility – it is not a compromise that is valid for Parliament. It is her filthy proposal that she has produced with the Council by skirting all of the rules.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to finish by saying that this is not about Mrs Bauer’s negotiation methods; it is about people and it is about whether we want to ensure decent conditions in an increasingly pressurised transport industry. This is something that I hope everyone in Parliament will support when we vote tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, some of my fellow Members claim that compliance with the 48-hour working week serves the interests of self-employed drivers and of road safety. This is a dirty campaign, as self-employed drivers continue to be covered by the Regulation on driving times and rest periods in any case. There is absolutely no threat to road safety. The problem is that some southern European trade unions fear that self-employed Romanian and Bulgarian drivers will take all the business. Those Members follow the trade unions like quivering lapdogs. That is the heart of the matter.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Kallas, the Commissioner for Transport, wishes to exclude self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive. He deserves our support in tomorrow’s votes. If he fails to obtain it, 16 June will be a dark day in the history of the European Parliament. It will kick citizens when they are down and give them piles of red tape on top. And then we complain that voter turnout falls further with every new election.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, once again we are in a debate that is crucial for protecting the rights of road transport workers and road safety. The Commission’s insistence since October 2008 on changing the 2002 directive is unacceptable. The Commission now wants it to cease to apply to so-called self-employed drivers, which would aggravate everyone’s working conditions, particularly due to the possibility that working hours will be increased to intolerable levels simply to allow greater profits for the major employers in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As an example, so-called self-employed drivers could end up working up to 86 hours per week over the whole year. This would not only jeopardise their health and safety, but would also present a danger to the safety of all other road users. It would also encourage social dumping and the deregulation of employment due to the increased numbers of drivers who falsely state that they are self-employed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Being receptive to arguments and studies that demonstrate the dangers of approving such a proposal, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has already rejected it twice, but unfortunately, the rapporteur, with the support of the Commission and the Council, has insisted on pursuing negotiations on the directive alone, as though the decision by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had never been made.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why we are now in this very serious situation. This issue needs to be clearly opposed by a majority in Parliament, but this has already been jeopardised by the Commissioner. We advocate rejecting the proposal, so as to prevent the continuation of this grave threat to workers’ rights and the safety of all road users in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore call for the rejection of the Commission’s proposal and compliance with the 2002 directive which, since 2009, should be being applied to self-employed drivers in order to combat social dumping, protect the right to health and rest for workers in the sector, and improve road safety conditions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are planning to extend this directive to self-employed drivers for the sake of a supposed increase in safety.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the arguments put forward are misleading and will have a detrimental effect. They are misleading because safety is already guaranteed under the 2006 regulation, and detrimental because the competitiveness of thousands of small independent businesses, which have already been sorely tested by the economic crisis, is at risk.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ladies and gentlemen, let us not pretend to be unaware of the fact that the legal and technical disputes regarding the directive actually conceal yet another power struggle between European statists, who are ready to place a new, dangerous burden on businesses, and the supporters of the human face of Europe, who are in touch with our citizens’ real needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">By intervening to legislate on the organisation of self-employed drivers’ working time, Parliament would be setting a dangerous precedent, authorising a European-branded takeover of entrepreneurship and free enterprise.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is time to put our words into practice. Let us stop exploiting small and medium-sized enterprises for our own ends. It is all too easy to praise widespread entrepreneurship when the aim is to come up with effective strategies to combat the crisis, and then to sacrifice these when EU bureaucracy wants to reassert its strength. I oppose the utopian war of principles with practicality. Europe must not encroach on the sphere of private enterprise and must respect the requests of our regions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am in favour of including self-employed drivers in the proposal for a directive, and I therefore reject both this proposal by the Commission and the Bauer report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am outraged by the way this proposal runs counter to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises by introducing, from this day forward, unfair competition from false self-employed drivers. This report introduces the practice of unfair competition and will allow it to develop with the growth in the number of false self-employed drivers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This proposal also runs counter to the interests of employees. At the very time when we are all working together to build a social Europe, this report reinforces social dumping between Member States. It is against the interests of employees, it is against the interests of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In short, this report flies in the face of road safety. I presided over a region crossed by heavy traffic from all over Europe, with significant accidents which gave rise to legal actions. These serious accidents should not escape our attention. We shall have to account for our decision to our fellow citizens. What is more, in 2002, two Member States of the European Union appealed to the European Court of Justice to repeal Directive 2002/15/EC because it included self-employed drivers; the Court rejected their appeal on the grounds of road safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, what we need is a European regulation between all Member States because, nowadays, transport is a European matter. The vote in committee was clear. I hope that it will be just as clear in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we have heard a great deal already. It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees. That is correct. However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work – whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker. That is only right. Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules. Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here. If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice. That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs. We consider Mrs Bauer’s proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right. That should be taken into account. We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the previous speaker described an ideal world in which drivers themselves decide whether they want to be self-employed or employees. Unfortunately, in reality, drivers no longer have this choice; instead, they are generally being pushed into being self-employed – or at least, ostensibly self-employed. That is the big problem that we face here – and if what we have here is a private compromise between a Member of Parliament and the Council which is being presented as a general compromise and which does not give consideration to this issue, then we are playing into the hands of social dumping in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Go and have a look at what is happening on the roads by visiting a checkpoint. Take a look at what is really going on in this sector. Go and have a look at the accidents – then you will realise that, as Members of the European Parliament, we cannot allow ourselves to advocate social dumping.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is vital that self-employed workers remain free of the clutches of the Working Time Directive in this way. This area of work is already heavily regulated via the driving time regulations and to listen to people saying that people are driven into self-employed work is utterly ludicrous; it is a choice that people make. The only thing bogus in all these discussions is the scaremongering claims of people saying that there are road safety dangers associated here.</p>
      <p sl="en">We talk here endlessly about promoting entrepreneurs; we talk about allowing them to flourish in the European Union. We are here actively encouraging small businesses, and to discourage them simply cannot be the way forward. So I would urge you to vote with Edit Bauer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months. I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense. The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes. Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become – how riddled it is with lies and half-truths?</p>
      <p sl="de">What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers. However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours. That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment. It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard. It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers! We cannot pass laws on the basis of ‘Let’s see what happens’. Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads? Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us abandon this nonsense. This is about fair competition. It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours. Do not play games like that with this House!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is essential that Amendment 30, with special regard to paragraph 7(a), be adopted. Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not a road safety issue. All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph. Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them, especially those who do not use an agency. Company drivers have their schedule provided, but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business. If included in these provisions, those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive, load, unload and cater for passengers, as compared to the commercially employed drivers. Thus, business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector. The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half the workforce.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore support the rapporteur in Amendment 30 as well as the Commission in this respect. You do not hear that very often from this part of the House.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, we believe it to be essential to include the self-employed in this directive, and this view is shared by the representatives of both unions and employers’ associations in my country, who have expressly requested the inclusion of the self-employed in this directive.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion. Firstly, because of workers’ safety: self-employed hauliers deserve the same protection as other hauliers, not just when they are driving, but also when they are undertaking other tasks that are directly related to a road transport operation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, for reasons of fair competition, as bringing back discrimination between self-employed and employed workers will distort both the labour market and the transport market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, it also seems inappropriate to me that each Member State should be able to apply the provisions of the directive to drivers if it so wishes. There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU, since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it, fair competition would be impeded.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, just for once, I will speak about procedure. Clearly, everybody agrees that we should support SMEs and, by rights, everybody ought to be concerned about issues regarding, at one and the same time, safety, workers, road users and the conditions for free and undistorted competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, after Parliament rejected this text in spring 2009, that summer, your predecessor, Commissioner Tajani, then canvassing his government for his re-appointment as Commissioner, told us that he would have some new proposals to make. Those new proposals were never referred to the relevant parliamentary committee for its consideration. Moreover, Mrs Bauer’s report was rejected by more members of that committee than had rejected the previous report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Bauer had no mandate to negotiate, on behalf of this Parliament, a first-reading agreement with the Council. The Commission and the Council have knowingly flouted the operating rules between the institutions. Mrs Bauer has flouted the code of conduct of this institution. This Parliament questions at times the nature of a first-reading agreement because it reduces our ability to negotiate. Now, in this instance, if Mrs Bauer’s amendments are approved, there will be a first-reading agreement that has not been examined by the bodies of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when we are seeing a balance being restored between the institutions thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament is turning its back on using its collective intelligence. I request, as a minimum, that Mrs Bauer’s proposals, which have never been examined in committee, be referred back to committee for consideration.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I support the Commissioner. Self-employed workers organise their own working hours, and that is the way it should stay. There is a difference between self-employed and employed workers, and that is only right and proper. This has nothing to do with road safety, as driving times and rest periods are identical whether the worker is self-employed or employed. These are monitored by a tachograph, which is intended for that and no other purpose. We do not look beyond this to monitor the road safety situation of employed and self-employed workers.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A second point relates to something I consider very problematic in the proposals by those who advocate including self-employed workers in the scope: how on earth are you going to monitor this? How do you propose to drop in on self-employed workers and ask when, where and how much they have worked? This kind of monitoring system would not be feasible and would subsequently be considered unacceptable. We should not be making such legislation; we should not be including self-employed workers in the scope of the directive concerning employed workers.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I come from Finland, where there are few people, distances are long and there are a lot of self-employed people. We do not need, will not tolerate and will not put up with extra restrictions on self-employed drivers. I am glad that the Estonian Commissioner, who is familiar with conditions in the northern countries, knows this, and that also applies to the Slovakian rapporteur. I want to thank you for that.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is an important question of principle. We cannot place restrictions on small business that apply to Europe as a whole. This may be a precedent and it is very dangerous. How does Europe think it will achieve growth and employment if its administrative decisions destroy employment and the preconditions for growth and kill them off?</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am on the side of Finnish owner drivers and in this case, that also means on the side of small business entrepreneurs all over Europe.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there must not, under any circumstances, be any restrictions put on the working time of self-employed drivers other than on their driving time.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The matter of road safety is addressed by restricting driving times and having compulsory rest periods, for which there is the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council pertaining to road transport and driving times and rest periods in force, and that applies to all – yes all – lorry and bus drivers, including self-employed ones. A much better option to prevent accidents through tiredness would be more effective monitoring of the driving times and rest periods in force rather than artificially restricting the working times of the self-employed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now there is a move to include such jobs as cleaning the vehicle, technical maintenance and completing consignment sheets in the restrictions on the working hours of self-employed drivers. How can we check whether a self-employed driver is washing his wife’s car or his truck in his own backyard? This is quite incomprehensible, because there are no restrictions on the working hours of other entrepreneurs. It would be a serious precedent if we went down that route.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As the previous speaker rightly said, in the Nordic countries, like my country, Finland, the transport sector is dominated by small business entrepreneurs and mainly consists of firms with just one or two vehicles. Restrictions on the working hours of entrepreneurs would favour large, supranational transport companies and would make it difficult for new transport firms to start up in business. The sector will certainly not be of interest to the young if we start to restrict artificially the potential to make a living. It would mean a dearth of capacity and increased costs. Already, logistical costs are, on average, higher in the Nordic countries than in the rest of Europe on account of our northern location and sparse population.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall get straight to the heart of the matter, namely the issue of self-employed workers. A reminder that the scope has covered all self-employed drivers since March of last year would certainly not go amiss. That is the present state of affairs; that is the point of departure the rapporteur should have taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Consequently, this is not the precedent the Commissioner claimed it to be. A more pragmatic approach should have been possible, namely including self-employed workers within the scope but, at the same time, taking account of the specific nature of self-employed drivers and keeping red tape to an absolute minimum.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As the rapporteur from the Committee on Transport and Tourism knows, I had drawn up a number of proposals. I proposed, for example, that the digital tachograph measure not only driving times and rest periods but also loading and unloading operations, supplemented by a kind of unmonitored fixed time for a number of other activities, such as administrative tasks and also cleaning and similar operations. She also knows quite well that activities such as customer contact are neither subject to monitoring nor counted as working time in any case.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, I regret that neither the Commission nor the rapporteur was willing to take account of this in any way whatsoever. The proposal to let Member States decide for themselves whether or not self-employed workers should fall within the scope does not strike me as a good one. The objective must be to arrive at common, uniform ground rules at European level so that the same rules apply to all.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal and the position adopted by the rapporteur leave the Member States free to choose whether or not to include self-employed workers in the scope of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules. By giving Member States freedom of choice, self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks, which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence, a serious distortion of competition. Businesses could, in fact, use self-employed workers more, as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost. It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and, above all, in safety, which, in the transport sector, results in a serious increase in road traffic risks.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the light of this, I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases, namely Article 153 of the treaty, since it neither improves the working environment nor protects workers’ health and safety.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I believe we should not arrogate to ourselves the competence to regulate the way they use their time. If there is abuse among the self-employed, we should target the abuse, rather than those honest individuals among the self-employed who are trying their best to continue to improve this sector.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I believe we should exercise great care when it comes to introducing bureaucracy, because too much of it can cause harm and break this sector, especially at a time like this when we have a crisis on our hands which is having a negative impact on all European sectors.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, the directive represents an important step in improving the health and safety of workers in this sector, but also in improving road safety and ensuring fair competition.

Despite being twice rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and once in plenary, contrary to a European Economic Area report as well as a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the directive – European law – is simply being amended and steered towards a point where economic interests are the only thing that count.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is obvious that what we are debating today is not the provisions on driving hours and rest times, which impact on road safety and are applicable to all professional drivers, be they employed or self-employed; rather, it is about the regulation of working hours. It is primarily a regulation for the protection of employees – in other words, it is solely for the social protection of drivers and in no way serves road safety. There is no need to protect the self-employed from themselves. How would we check the hours worked by self-employed HGV and bus drivers without a huge amount of bureaucracy, and on what basis would we be checking this anyway?</p>
      <p sl="de">Restricting the permissible working hours of self-employed professional drivers in this way – and perhaps, in future, also those of self-employed tradesmen, architects or Members of Parliament – would send out the wrong signal.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, extending the Working Time Directive to cover self-employed people is nonsensical. It is window-dressed to protect employees’ rights and therefore has no place in a self-employed framework. It is also unenforceable without infringing people’s liberties by carrying out checks in their homes.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not a matter of road safety. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 already covers driving time and is applicable to large companies, small businesses and the self-employed. You still need an operator’s licence to work if you are self-employed and would therefore be the registered holder of that licence. Anything which may jeopardise the licence would therefore jeopardise the licence holder’s whole livelihood. With this in mind, it is safe to assume that there is just cause for self-employed drivers to be even more fastidious than big firms. Everything directly related to the service would be considered part of working time; for example, paperwork, maintenance and general administration. In large firms, people are employed to do this; therefore, administration time has no impact on driving time. Self-employed doing their own administration would find, under the directive’s conditions, little time left to do the driving itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">As an aside, I believe the Commission also proposed a relaxation of restrictions over night work by introducing a two-hour qualifying period before night-time restrictions apply. I rarely agree with the Commission but this would also be a welcome amendment. I fully support the rapporteur, Ms Bauer.</p>

How, for example, can economic activity be stimulated, if this place – the European Parliament – is going to be a place where we bring in new legislation which restricts that entrepreneurship? After all, if people want to start up on their own in business, including the transport business, they should have the right to do so. We must not treat them, on the one hand, as businesspeople and, on the other, say that they have to comply with criteria designed for employees.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I believe that Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important at this time, because the truth is that we will only find a way out of the debt crisis if we work more. It is entirely unnecessary to burden the self-employed with yet more bureaucracy and paperwork. Quite simply, if we are to be able to ensure social security in Europe, then it is very important that we increase productivity and competitiveness. Consequently, the driving times and rest times currently guaranteed by tachographs are entirely sufficient. I would ask those Members who advocate that the directive should apply to all to apply it to themselves and to have a tachograph installed in their own cars – and then not to use their cars on Thursday evening when they go home after working here for 15 hours.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ensuring safety is important but, on the other hand, we must also protect the self-employed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you very much for this debate. I listened with great interest to all your contributions. There is a great temptation to go into detail and to have a debate on the details of this discussion, but I would like only to say that I still confirm the Commission position, which is built on facts. We do not have the studies mentioned here that self-employed drivers are regularly working 90 hours per week, and we think that the Driving Time Regulation, which we would like to enforce, will harmonise practices between Member States and will fulfil this task to ensure and improve road safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">Road safety has improved very largely due to the use of the Driving Time Directive. We do not have the information that they are more sick, and why do we sometimes think that small and medium-sized enterprises are behaving irresponsibly, that they do not care about road safety or about their own health, so they must be more regulated than others?</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission cannot support legislation which limits the freedom of entrepreneurs in the road transport sector to organise their working time, while in other sectors, entrepreneurs are not subject to similar working time restrictions. However, if the vote in this House confirms the rejection of the Commission proposal, then the Commission will review all possible options, including withdrawal of the proposal, and if Parliament decides to include self-employed drivers in this directive, we will enforce your will. We will immediately inquire with Member States how they apply the working time rules on self-employed drivers and how they monitor compliance with these rules.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would like to address five matters very briefly. The Rules of Procedure. I have studied the Rules of Procedure carefully, and as far as I know, MEPs have full discretion to carry out their mandate and therefore they can consult whoever they want. According to the Rules of Procedure, the parliamentary committee does not require MEPs to voice the committee’s position. It is the plenary session’s position that is binding. That is exactly what the Rules of Procedure say. I do not question, either, the grounds on which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament submitted its proposed amendment, nor who it consulted.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In agreement with the shadow rapporteurs, I also had informal discussions with representatives of the Commission and the Council when I thought it was important. I agree that the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs is a real European problem, and we incorporated it in the proposal, in cooperation with the fellow Members who considered the exclusion of self-employed entrepreneurs important. This issue must be addressed, but it is not a sector-specific problem.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There is a misconception that has been stated repeatedly here, namely, that compliance with this law can be monitored at an international level. This law requires monitoring at a national level. Let me add that at a 4% rate, inspection would be more expensive than moving the European Parliament from Brussels to Strasbourg. I would like to ask my fellow Members to take this into consideration as well. If we reject this proposal, I would also like to say to my fellow Members that we are creating an advantage for third country hauliers. I would like to ask my fellow Members to bear in mind that this is the proposal which the Commission approved. To reject the proposal of the Commission, that is, of the European Commission, is to make it pointless, expensive and impossible to implement.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I approve of the position adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the rejection of the Commission’s proposal and agree that in conjunction with Parliament, the Commission must take action so that a new improved proposal is submitted by the Commission in future. I would like to stress that the Commission’s proposal to remove self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive would represent a significant step backwards in EU social policy and in the area of transport. I would like to draw attention to the fact that ‘false’ self-employed drivers weaken the overall labour market, and the main problem is that in practice, it is difficult to prove ‘false’ self-employment. If we fail to take concrete action and legal measures, then false self-employed work by drivers will become one of the labour market’s greatest problems and we will be unable to avoid unfair competition. In order to improve the working conditions of all drivers and ensure their social rights and guarantees and in order to improve road safety, as well as avoid unfair competition in the European road transport market, we cannot adopt the Commission’s proposal such as it stands today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The directive that we are debating today is the fruit of very lengthy negotiations in the European Parliament over two mandates. This is a very sensitive issue, as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future. It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States. I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day, 84 hours a week, and not be a risk on the roads? Compared with a company-employed driver, this is unfair competition. This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed. We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and, failing that, I call on MEPs, during tomorrow’s vote in plenary, to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers within the scope of working time legislation.</p>

      <p sl="fi">In certain EU countries, there is justified concern on the part of the trade union movement about phoney self-employment in connection with the Working Time Directive and self-employed drivers. Outsourcing and, as a consequence, employers evading their responsibilities, are growing problems. The way to solve the problem that has been suggested, that is, that self-employed drivers should be included in the directive, however, is wrong. The right way to resolve the problems associated with phoney self-employment would be to agree on a definition for self-employment between worker and employer organisations at EU level. At present, the innocent have to suffer.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With regard to this issue, we should proceed in accordance with the compromise which, among others, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Vice-Chair of the centre-right European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), was building. Under this, freelance drivers remain outside the scope of the directive, but Member States may, if they wish, apply the regulation of full-time working hours to freelance drivers in their own country. The suggestion would probably mean that Parliament and the Council would reach agreement on the directive at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is a pity that Parliament is not allowing any opportunities for a compromise. While we should be focusing more on improving the status of entrepreneurs, instead there is the possibility that the working hours of genuine entrepreneurs will be restricted. This is worrying, because the opportunities for small entrepreneurs to earn a living generally depend solely on the work they put in.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Sommer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers (COM(2008)0040 – C6-0052/2008 – 2008/0028(COD)) (A7-0109/2010).</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend the four minutes allotted to me to six minutes, because this dossier is so huge that otherwise, it will not be possible to speak adequately on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">Consumers have a right to know what foods contain. Only if they have information on the composition and nutritional value of foods can they make an informed purchasing decision. Although Community law contains a great many regulations and directives on food labelling, there has not, until now, been a comprehensive mandatory labelling system. It has now become difficult for food manufacturers and distributors to maintain an overview of the multiplicity of existing laws – whether these are EU laws or national laws of the Member States. There is legal uncertainty, distortion of competition and obstacles to trade in the internal market. The present draft regulation is intended to deal with all these issues by providing uniform EU-wide food labelling. The aims are improved information to consumers, better regulation, harmonisation and less bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission draft does not live up to these requirements, however, since it is based on assumptions and suppositions concerning consumers’ wishes and requirements, imposes unrealistic labelling requirements – such as the 3 mm font size, which does not even ensure that the information is legible, and favours big business to the detriment of SMEs – which actually make up 80% of the food sector. In so doing, it contravenes the Small Business Act. It also runs counter to the goal of harmonisation in the internal market, in that the intention is to expressly allow 27 additional national labelling systems. Extensive amendment of the Commission text is therefore called for.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is what we have attempted to do. Information must be legible. However, font size is only one of many factors in this. We need rules on the font, line thickness, contrast, etc. We need binding guidelines on legibility. Information must be comparable and therefore it must always relate to 100 grams or 100 millilitres, without an option of only stating the nutritional value per portion. Then, when shopping, people will be able to see at a glance which is the ‘lightest’ yoghurt – regardless of the size of the yoghurt pot.</p>
      <p sl="de">Information must be understandable. It is time to get rid of the kilojoule at last, which nobody can work out. We want to concentrate on kilocalories again; that is what consumers are interested in, and it is what they understand. Stated portion sizes must reflect reality and be realistic and understandable to consumers and, if possible, should be uniform throughout the EU. Information must not be allowed to mislead consumers concerning the content of the products or their origin or their actual nature. Imitation foods such as cheese analogues and processed meat that is made up of small pieces pressed together should be labelled as such on the front of the packaging. Consumers need to know what they are buying.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the final event, however, consumers will no longer bother reading if we in fact overload the front of the products with further information. Consequently, I am proposing that the only nutritional value stated is the number of kilocalories per 100 grams or 100 millilitres. Then they will read it – it is what interests them, and I believe that is a realistic solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also think we should remove nutritional profiles. I hope that we can stop them. These profiles are superfluous because the new regulation labels nutritional values in any case. Nutritional profiles discriminate against basic foods, and the threshold values for salt, sugar and fat are entirely arbitrary – having been thought up by Commission officials on no scientific basis whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="de">The real aim of the regulation on the provision of information on nutritional values and health properties of foods is to provide truthful health information, and for this, we do not need any additional assessment of individual foods or their classification into good and bad foods. In the end, it is overall diet and lifestyle that count. We should ask ourselves why the big food corporations are currently lobbying so hard for nutritional profiles. That is something we should really question.</p>
      <p sl="de">The so-called traffic light system proposed here has the same kinds of shortcomings as nutritional profiles. Once again, it incorrectly forces us to classify products as good or bad. The threshold values for the colours are arbitrary and the breadth of each colour category is too great. It discriminates against basic foodstuffs, favours imitation foods, and also favours products containing artificial ingredients; in other words, those containing sweetener rather than sugar and flavour enhancers rather than salt. That really cannot be in the interests of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">The GDA model – the industry’s model for labelling – has obvious shortcomings. It is incomprehensible because it contains too many figures. It is misleading because it only describes the daily requirement of a 40-year-old woman and provides no recommended daily amount whatsoever for the amount of sugar consumed, for example. It is difficult for SMEs to implement the GDA model. That would once again provide big business with a competitive advantage. That is another good reason why GDA labelling should not be made mandatory.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need to protect our traditional food production. Only then can we ensure the continued existence of the regional specialities and our food diversity in the EU that we are so fond of. We therefore need extensive exemption of non-prepackaged products from this regulation, since traditional products are precisely those that have not been standardised. These manufacturers can still provide information on allergens, for example, verbally when making the sale.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then a few words on country of origin labelling. The question is whether consumers really want to know where all the ingredients in their foods come from or whether there is actually a protectionist agenda at work here. I would firstly like to know whether it is feasible, which is why I am calling for an impact analysis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, it should be stated that food labelling can never be a manual for good diet. We need information campaigns and we need to educate people in the Member States about balanced diets and healthy lifestyles.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not the job of the legislator to nanny its master, which, in this case, is the citizen. It must provide assistance, but our citizens are responsible for themselves and it is not for us to take over that responsibility. Finally, I would like to express my great thanks to all those involved, the shadow rapporteurs, even if they were not always prepared to compromise, everyone who has supported me, particularly my …</p>

    <intervention id="2-053" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, as I have said on previous occasions, our aim is to ensure that consumers know what they are buying and what they are eating, thus making it easier to choose a diet for themselves and their families in tune with their needs, their wishes and their goals; citizens – consumers – have a right to the right information. I would appeal to honourable Members to keep this firmly in mind throughout the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before turning to the substance of the proposal, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sommer, for preparing the report, and also the shadow rapporteurs. Whilst being sympathetic to most of her statements, I cannot say I agree with all of them. I should also mention the input from other committees, IMCO and AGRI.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to briefly highlight the most important issues covered by the proposed amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question of mandatory origin labelling is very important and needs careful assessment. Indeed, there is a recurrent demand for the mandatory provisions of such information for some foods. The Commission could partially accept the proposed amendment for an extension of the cases of mandatory origin labelling. Origin labelling for basic primary foodstuffs which have not undergone substantial processing and are generally considered as single ingredient products could be a pragmatic option. However, given the complexity of the matter, the application of any mandatory labelling should be subject to the entry into force of delegated measures and be based on impact assessments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legibility is a major issue and one of the main complaints that consumers make. This is a key demonstration that we are putting consumers first in our debate and I hope that honourable Members can support the idea of a minimum font size. It is thus regrettable that the amendments tabled would undermine the aim of having measurable criteria as a basis for enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I share the concerns of honourable Members about imitation foods. I am therefore happy to see Parliament table an amendment containing a provision to explicitly prohibit such misleading practices. However, the introduction of a definition and specific designation of such products would provoke legal problems, and we therefore need to find those designations which give correct and unambiguous information to the consumer. I am also pleased to note the broad support for mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labelling and the endorsement of voluntary schemes by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The principle that consumers should know what they eat should apply not only to prepacked foods but also to food that they buy over the counter or when they eat out. I am therefore not in favour of amendments which would limit the scope of the draft regulation. That said, I am open to changing the text on non-prepacked food so that allergen information alone would be mandatory, while Member States could decide on further mandatory requirements for such food.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the suggestion for mandatory labelling of nano-ingredients, I am pleased to accept the amendment in principle, although there needs to be a suitable definition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the issue of nutrient profiles, let me state that I cannot accept the amendments to delete or modify Article 4 in the proposed way, as this provision would undermine the existing regulation on food claims. We are all aware that many claims are misleading for consumers; some because they are not substantiated, others because they do not give the full picture of the food in question, claiming only their positive aspects. It must also be stated that claims are made on the sole initiative of the manufacturer for the purpose of selling more products. We are not imposing nutrient profiles on anyone. We are insisting on nutrient profiles where manufacturers choose to market their products through claims, so that consumers can have balanced food information.</p>
      <p sl="en">The establishment of nutrient profiles does not prohibit or in any way limit the food products that manufacturers can produce. Food manufacturers can continue to produce whichever way they want to. However, it is unfair to our consumers and citizens to allow claims that may mislead them. It is, for me, a question of providing our citizens with honest and full information about the products which they are consuming. Let us not forget that the Claims Regulation was adopted following in-depth debate amongst the institutions. The core principles of the regulation remain valid and relevant. Having said this, I am looking into the establishment of nutrient profiles with an open mind and I am ready to consider positively certain exemptions as they relate to traditional and basic products with an important dietary role.</p>
      <p sl="en">On this basis, I urge you to support the Commission’s endeavours to ensure that we have a meaningful basis to protect consumers and foster innovation in the food sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to an interesting debate and hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has formulated an opinion in respect of Mrs Sommer’s report on food labelling. In our work in this committee, it has been crucial for us to ensure that consumers receive the proper tools to be able to make healthy and correct choices when it comes to food. Thus, in the committee, we are in agreement that using food labelling to mislead consumers is totally unacceptable. We are also in agreement that consumers must be provided with clear information through good labelling. Of course, we also agree that the rules should enable the internal market to function as well as possible. Thus, we are in agreement on the fundamental principles. However, when it comes to the specifics – the question of how this is to be done – there was not a particularly high level of agreement in our committee, and the same degree of disagreement could also be seen in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. This shows what a difficult issue this is. Therefore, in actual fact, I should first and foremost like to urge the rapporteur to remember that this food information is intended primarily to be a tool for the consumer and not a marketing tool for enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather angry as I stand here before you, because I am going to focus on Amendment 101, concerning country of origin or place of provenance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A split vote amendment was tabled on behalf of my group in order to clearly distinguish between the two, since they do not mean the same thing. In short, the country of origin is the country in which the foodstuff was last processed, while the place of provenance is clearly the place of origin of the raw ingredient, notably fruit and vegetables, and Mr Dalli pointed this out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, what is particularly serious is the fact that Parliament’s services have rejected this split vote amendment and are incapable of telling me which rule of the Rules of Procedure allows them to do so. I am even being told that this is standard procedure. This is therefore very serious because this decision – an arbitrary one in my view – will obviously influence the substance of the decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would ask you to speak to the services on my behalf in order to denounce this arbitrary decision and to ensure that, within the next 24 hours, the services reconsider and accept this sound amendment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Sommer for her tough, committed work. She has been subjected to some baseless criticism that she does not deserve.</p>
      <p sl="de">That also obscures the fact that there are many matters on which we agree. We all want better labelling of imitation foods. Cheese is made of milk, and if it contains other things, then it must be labelled as an imitation on the front of the packaging. We also all want binding nutritional labelling. We do not yet have this. It is something that we all want. We also all want it to be in a unit that consumers understand.</p>
      <p sl="de">On this matter, allow me to tell you a joke that is doing the rounds here in Germany – and perhaps in some other countries too: ‘What do you call the little animals that sew your clothes tighter while they are in the wardrobe? Calories.’ Nobody anywhere in Europe would tell this joke using kilojoules. The kilojoule has not taken off as a unit. It confuses people and therefore, we do not need to specify it as mandatory information. The calorie is the unit that informed consumers use in their calculations. There is thus a great deal of agreement. There are also differences, for example, on the matter of nutritional profiles. Our group wishes these to be removed, or at least clarification that basic foods will be exempt.</p>
      <p sl="de">There has been heated discussion over salt in bread, French cheese and similar things. I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli and President Barroso for having attempted to provide clarification on these matters. There is no College decision, however, and consequently, we need this to be clarified once and for all. I would ask you to support the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in this area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this proposal has been highly controversial and it is extremely complex. As the shadow rapporteur for my group, my guiding principles have been to ask: what information do consumers want when buying food for their families, and how best can we provide this information?</p>
      <p sl="en">Our continent faces an obesity epidemic on a scale never before seen. We are eating too much fat, sugar and salt, and it is contributing to heart disease, diabetes, increased risk of cancer, strokes, liver disease and even depression. Of course, simply ensuring consumers can easily identify the nutritional content of their food is not a magic cure, but it will enable consumers to be more aware of the food they buy, compare products and identify the healthiest option at a glance, thus taking control of what they eat.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am proposing we use a colour coding system to do this, not to make a judgment on the product as a whole, but to inform consumers if the product they are buying is low, medium or high in salt, fat and sugar. This will only apply to complex processed foods such as ready-to-eat meals, breakfast cereals and all of those convenience foods produced on an industrial scale whose nutritional content – which is often poor – consumers are often unaware of or misinformed about.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I stress that this will not apply to German bread. It will not apply to butter or cheese or apple juice, or even alcohol. I have emailed every MEP with more information so please, before you make up your minds, read it so that you know exactly what is being proposed, rather than listening to misleading industrial lobbying or flawed arguments from certain quarters of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also urge colleagues to support mandatory country of origin labelling. It is clear that consumers are becoming more conscious of the origin of the food on their plate and want honest food labelling. Of course, this will not always be feasible. Nevertheless, for single products, it is clear that their agricultural origin should be available to consumers and this is 100% feasible. It is already in place for beef, for fish, and for fresh fruit and vegetables. For the ingredients of processed products, it is, of course, more complex, which is why it is only being proposed for meat, poultry and fish in processed foods.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a final note, we talk a lot in this House about the importance of consumer choice and prevention in public health. Now is our chance to prove that we are serious. Colleagues, actions speak louder than words. Please support my proposals.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement at the start of this debate, and also Mrs Sommer for her work as rapporteur. I have the impression, after almost a year in this House, that we believe we can change the behaviour of millions of Europeans just like that with a mere piece of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The same belief surrounds this regulation. However, we must realise that nothing is as hard as changing people’s behaviour, particularly when we are talking about 500 million of them. Therefore, our ultimate influence over that behaviour via labelling will be limited. This does not mean I am completely dismissing this regulation through reservations – absolutely not – but we do have to be realistic about the force of this instrument.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must realise that consumers are entitled to the information. In addition, whatever the outcome of this debate, consumers will obtain much more information after the second reading. In the longer term, on the other hand, we must invest more in education, and in teaching people from the bottom up how to have healthy lifestyles.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another point is that the debate in this House concerns the fundamental objectives of this directive. Are we forcing people to make a healthy choice of foodstuffs or are we giving them the opportunity to decide for themselves what foodstuffs to choose? We, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, believe people should be given the information, and that they are capable of making their own choices.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, we must be sure to strike a balance with regard to the amount of information we provide to people, as too much or too little will never work. I believe we are on the right track per se. Let us trust that people who can vote for us are also sufficiently capable of choosing the right foodstuff in the shops if provided with the appropriate information.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, the power that consumers possess is based on them receiving information. If we do not force undertakings to provide correct information, consumers will not receive it and then the whole of the internal market will collapse. We cannot determine centrally what information is important for a particular consumer. Consumers have different requirements and we need to try to satisfy as many of those as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We run the risk of playing into the hands of the industry if we are reluctant to warn consumers about high calorie content, salt, fat and so on. It is no stranger to have a colour coding system for nutrient content than to warn consumers when they buy an energy guzzling car or an energy intensive refrigerator.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must not defer the origin marking by carrying out studies; we need to implement it right now. The animals and those who want to protect the animals’ welfare cannot wait until information is available as to whether animals have been transported live to slaughterhouses far away.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Neither must we play into the hands of the alcohol industry. Alcohol manufacturers are constantly demanding to be treated in the same way as regular food undertakings, but now that we are about to regulate food, they no longer want to be included. That is disgraceful. Many consumers do not know that alcohol has a high calorie content and that, for example, a glass of white wine contains twice as many calories as a similar quantity of a soft drink.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When it comes to nutrient profiles, I take a completely different view from Mrs Sommer. They reduce the possibility of undertakings describing products as beneficial when they are not. The system specifies limits and reduces the possibility of false marketing. I totally agree with the Commission on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like to mention a couple of minor issues. We said ‘no’ to thrombin at an early stage. There are other similar products on the market, and Mrs Sommer and I have both tabled amendments that are intended to provide a correct description of these products. I hope they receive support. We currently sell sausages on the market that contain large quantities of connective tissue and fat but are nevertheless referred to as meat. We now have a chance to rectify this. With regard to egg products and other products of animal origin, we could label them according to the system that already applies to eggs, in other words, a system that indicates the conditions under which the animals have been reared. That would be a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, one of the most contentious items in this debate has been country of origin labelling. I firmly believe that consumers have a right to know the origin of the food they purchase and, particularly in the case of meat, if it has been produced to high welfare standards and has not been transported over great distances prior to slaughter. But the sourcing of raw materials in processed food is irreversibly complex, as ingredients are chosen based on price, quality and availability and countries of origin in a single meat processing plant may alter day by day, and even hour by hour.</p>
      <p sl="en">The constant adaptation of labels would carry higher costs and will inevitably increase packaging waste. These additional costs would be passed on to the consumer. That is why I believe that the feasibility of mandatory labelling rules must first be subject to an impact assessment, and I am glad that Commissioner Dalli said that he supports that.</p>
      <p sl="en">But while this debate focuses on raw materials or ingredients of foodstuffs, it does not cover the origin of the final product. This is particularly important for specific products like whisky. It is still possible for low-quality whiskies from countries like India, China and Japan to pass themselves off as the genuine article by carrying pictures, images or names on their labels which are reminiscent of the traditional whisky-producing countries in the EU in order to increase their competitive advantage and mislead the consumer. We must guard against this, and I therefore urge you to support Amendment 254.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Again, the question here is whether Europe chooses the food industry or the consumer. Tomorrow, you will nail your colours to the mast: will you support a clear system of colour coding for food labels or will you place your trust in the industry? The political choice is simple, as far as I am concerned. If you wish to safeguard commercial interests, you will support the ideas of the food industry. If you want a label that you have helped choose to indicate high, medium or low sugar, salt or fat, you will vote for a system of colour coding.</p>
      <p sl="nl">60% of your voters are overweight, as are 25% of our children. 25% of people have reading difficulties. Why does everyone consider colour coding normal on energy labels for housing, cars or electronic goods, for example, but patronising on foodstuffs? Nutrition experts and consumer organisations recommend a simple colour coding system to make food labels understandable and to make it easy for people to make their own choices. I, too, support that.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to vote on a draft report on information to consumers, but have we really asked ourselves what consumers want? Have these considerations been agreed on behind closed doors in Parliament, or do they reflect the interests of consumers?</p>
      <p sl="it">The latest survey announced by the Commission may not be representative of the increased awareness that consumers have developed in recent years with regard to information about their food choices. It is not only the origin but also the ingredients and other characteristics that are becoming a fundamental part of the decision-making process. Are we aware that the decisions we make today will influence tomorrow’s purchases? Should it not be consumers who determine the market? Why not try to understand, through a new survey or by maintaining ongoing direct dialogue with consumers, what it is that they really want?</p>
      <p sl="it">We must represent consumers as best we can. That is why we are here and, from the meetings I have had, I have discovered that consumers want to be involved more. They do not expect the buying process to be complicated by the inclusion of pointless information on labels, but nor do they expect overly simplistic, misleading choices such as the traffic light system, which risk providing irrelevant information that is not necessary for an informed choice and does not meet their needs. Our approach must not be paternalistic but open to dialogue.</p>

We support the mandatory indication of the place of origin and we also believe that it should be possible to hold not only the manufacturer but also the distributor responsible for non-compliance with the rules. In addition to the numerical data, which are often difficult to interpret, we believe it is necessary to introduce uniform colour coding that distinguishes healthy food from unhealthy foodstuffs. However, this is not sufficient for healthy foods to gain ground. It must be said that multinational companies are responsible for spreading these poor quality products they call foodstuffs throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It must be said that Cora, Tesco, Auchan, Metro and the like are responsible for flooding the Hungarian market with junk they call food.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri-food industry, because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it. I agree with her on the main subjects regarding nutritional information and the controversial issue of profiles, especially if we bear in mind that the Commission failed to meet its commitment to establish these profiles – as well as the conditions for their use – before 19 January, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.</p>
      <p sl="es">An issue that concerns me is the possibility that national labelling standards will be in existence at the same time: this runs counter to the purpose of the legislation, which is harmonisation and the removal of as many obstacles as possible to the working of a true single market.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards the indication of country of origin, under the current legislation, this information must be given when failure to do so could mislead the consumer. There is also provision for there always being voluntary labelling. Going further may involve a financial cost and administrative cost for companies, without bringing the consumer any significant and clear benefit.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the use of different languages, I have to say that the Commission’s proposal matches up with the existing directive, which has worked well and not caused problems. Reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary, and could cause problems with the movement of products.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my speech will focus on the issue of colour coding. We are told that ‘it is complicated’. That is not true; it makes things easier. We are told that ‘it is a ban’. It is not a ban; it is actually a form of information. We are told that ‘it treats consumers like children’, but in that case, we should also be told, Mr President, why it is that consumers’ associations are actually demanding this colour coding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must be clear, and stop all this hypocrisy and pretence. We have a choice to make here between, in fact, defending public health and the consumer, and bowing to demands from lobbies, which, moreover, are very short-term demands because, without this labelling, they are only relevant in the very short term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as I am concerned, as far as we are concerned, the choice should be clear.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are what we eat, we are steadily becoming the products of industry. This is linked to the fact that it is becoming common for people to be overweight and the by-products of that, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are also becoming common.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The packaging of food must provide clear and truthful information on its content. The clearest indication of its general health-promoting properties would be the traffic light model, which even a child understands at a single glance. If we do not achieve this at EU level, at least it should be permitted nationally.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would also like to focus attention on the matter of trans fatty acids. The Committee was in favour of the compulsory labelling of industrial trans fatty acids, and I hope that Parliament as a whole will follow suit. The Committee commissioned a summary to be drawn up of studies of the effects on health of trans fatty acids. According to that summary, there is so much evidence of their harmful effects that the most obvious option would be to ban industrial trans fatty acids, as they have in Denmark. At the very least, they should appear on packaging labels in order for us to know what we are buying, when, for example, we purchase biscuits, chocolate, potato crisps or ice cream.</p>

We must ensure first of all that people – the consumers – know where the produce came from. Then the consumer also has to know very clearly how that food was prepared or how it got to where it is. I agree with the rapporteur on this, and I think we are in danger here of going too far too soon.</p>

I want to see us proceed with a degree of caution, but let us get it right. I do not want us to over-regulate in Europe to a position where even we in Europe do not know where we are coming from. We are in great danger of over-regulating ourselves out of the market. We have to control this and get it right, and I am totally in favour of it.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I do not think anyone in this House will argue with the fact that consumers want and need safe, traceable and wholesome food, and no one can argue that there is not a need for accurate and honest labelling of food. However, we must be careful not to create information overload in any labelling system. Too much unintelligible information will lead to consumers ignoring the essential information and paying attention to information which has no real value. Therefore, simplicity and valuable information should be the key criteria in a labelling system.</p>
      <p sl="en">I, like my colleagues, support country of origin labelling. I do believe that it is important that we know where our food comes from. The farming and fishing industries and communities which are represented in this House produce food under very stringent regulation yet, for example, 60% of the fish we eat is imported into the EU and, in most cases, not reared under the same strict environmental and regulatory regimes. We need to ensure that our systems create level playing fields for our communities and our industries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise two particular points. The first one concerns nutrient profiles. I am against their deletion, as I would remind you that they were drawn up with the sole aim of determining whether or not a foodstuff can carry a health claim. The aim, in fact, is to avoid consumers being misled by health claims that are sometimes displayed on foodstuffs that are often very high in fat, salt and sugar. I therefore put it to you that we should reject the amendment to delete nutrient profiles, profiles which, I might add, we approved in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to draw your attention to the risk inherent in Amendment 205, which envisages labelling meat derived from animals that have been ritually slaughtered. The danger is that it would stigmatise certain religious groups, as labelling of this nature would create ill-founded distrust amongst certain consumers. May I remind you that some meat which is entirely suitable for consumption is sold on the ordinary market, as it cannot be consumed by believers for religious reasons. What is more, this meat comes from certified abattoirs, which fully meet health criteria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The economic consequences would therefore be quite significant, the survival of a number of ritual abattoirs would be under threat, and that would jeopardise the livelihoods of small, local farmers. What I think we need is a good dose of common sense in labelling so that consumers receive the right information. More importantly, however, I believe that colour coding will also have the effect of stigmatising produce. I do not think that it is quite the right solution yet.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the thousand amendments from the committee that we are seeing in Parliament are the best demonstration of our goodwill. However, as well as goodwill, I think that we have to be practical when labelling food if we do not want to have the opposite effect to the one we are aiming for: in other words, confusing consumers rather than informing them.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is a case of warning, not explaining. It is a case of informing them what they can eat and in what quantities they can eat it. Is labelling on fat, sugar and transfats necessary? Indeed it is. Is labelling on things that affect cholesterol – on all substances that affect what we have mentioned: obesity and people’s health – necessary? It is. Nevertheless, including other types of information, whilst potentially very informative, could end up being confusing in the case of some foodstuffs: for example, the place of origin, or, in the case of meat, where the beast was born, where it has passed through, where it was raised and where it was slaughtered.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is up to us to be practical and to make sure that this regulation becomes one that will harmonise and inform consumers; if not, it will cause greater confusion and impose issues that, far from achieving better levels of health, will achieve greater levels of confusion.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why I suggest that for some foodstuffs, we opt for a guideline daily amount instead of the traffic lights, because that way, it is very clear that if you eat a certain amount or twice that amount of a given product, you will get fat and, therefore, that you should only eat one of them. Some of us are suggesting a maximum daily allowance in place of other types of code so as not to confuse consumers further.</p>

In a response to a parliamentary question he has just given me, he says that 44 000 applications for health claims have been made by companies. The European Food Safety Authority is completely swamped and the Commission has not yet given a single opinion in response to these applications.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the principle of providing more and better nutritional information to consumers has been at the forefront of this report and is a commendable aim. However, during the process of the report through this Parliament, I have had enlightening discussions on the font size on a packet of chewing gum, whether chicken is in fact a meat, or whether a Twix bar is classified as one portion or two. We have forgotten what is important and essential to the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The traffic light system of labelling excessively simplifies nutritional profiles, causing even the most basic information to become vague and abstract. This directly affects the choices available to consumers and has a disproportionately negative impact on staple foods. Just as certain Members have been quick to make judgments, the traffic light system provides too judgmental an assessment of foodstuffs and the complex nutritional composition of food; its place in the diet cannot be reduced to a simple colour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consumers want to know where their food is from, and essential information on what is in it – especially allergenic information – to allow them to make the best choice of food product.

      <p sl="pl">From the point of view of the common internal market, the question of harmonising the principles of labelling and the mutual recognition of food products is of great significance. Currently, additional national legislation and existing EU legislation on food products, which is variously interpreted by different Member States, are a source of difficulties in trade and the flow of goods, and of problems in the area of competition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am troubled by the provisions concerning the obligation to provide information about the country of origin of products of specific categories. In my opinion, this is an expression of the protectionist attitudes of Member States, and is at variance with the idea of a common market which eliminates fundamental barriers and difficulties in the movement of goods. Therefore, bearing in mind the good of consumers, I think that information on the country of origin of products should be given based on the voluntary principle and in cases where the lack of this information could mislead the consumer concerning the true source of the product. I consider such an approach to be balanced, both from the point of view of the good of consumers and the interest of food producers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During this debate on the Commission’s regulation and Mrs Sommer’s report, the question of a balanced diet and the eating habits of EU residents has been raised many times. In my opinion, food labelling is only one of many aspects of information for consumers about healthy eating. It can extend society’s knowledge in the area of healthy living, for example, by campaigns and educational measures, but it cannot be a substitute for this knowledge. Therefore, I am opposed to the introduction of colour coding of foods, which might have permanent consequences for eating habits.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is not every day that we debate legislation which is the cause of such intense interest among our electorate. It is a well-known fact that a clear label on a food product influences consumer decisions and, in addition, encourages producers to promote healthy food.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One issue which has come up in the legislative process and our discussion concerns information about the origin of food. Labels have to state the country of production of food items, including in the instance of processed food.

      <p sl="pl">Equally important is information about the contents of alcoholic beverages. I share the view that information about the ingredients and nutritional values of alcoholic beverages should be available on the packaging. The consumer ought to know if the vodka he is buying was made from cereals, potatoes or perhaps bananas. No one in this Chamber questions the need for change and the introduction of more comprehensive legislation.

      <p sl="it">The report by Mrs Sommer, who must be thanked for her efforts in bringing together a large number of requirements, is therefore intended to provide a solution to the controversies and the differences between the consumer information systems in force in the Member States. It is not by chance that national regulations still differ in terms of how to describe the nature of foodstuffs for sale, creating a system that differs from one country to the next and also fuelling unfair competition, to the detriment of potential consumers. On the basis of the European Commission proposal, an attempt is therefore being made to revamp the current legislation by involving both the food industries and consumers. At the same time, the report obliges the European food industry to introduce some clarity into mandatory labelling, as well as the labelling and presentation of the nutritional value of foods.</p>
      <p sl="it">In a globalised market, the European Union could not escape the need to adapt and reform legislation on food products in order to protect the food trade, among other things, and to safeguard it from increasingly invasive and uncontrolled international competition. There is nothing new about the fact that we are hearing more and more about the dangers posed by food products that surreptitiously carry designations and statements that often do not meet dietary requirements but are nonetheless passed off as products that are good for human health.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the labelling of food products is vital in order to guarantee food safety. I advocate clear information for the consumer but, at the same time, less bureaucracy, the simplification of regulation, more legal security and increased competitiveness in the food industry, without forgetting the smaller companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Direct selling by farmers cannot be subject to the rules of this regulation, nor can local and artisanal products. Products like these ensure our diversity and safeguard our deepest roots. Consumers need to be informed without their choices being pressurised or our regional products being stigmatised.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission’s proposal is overly nannying because it tries to push consumers in a certain direction instead of giving them the information. Some want to decide what is on our menu; others want to tell us which dishes we can and cannot eat. I assure you that the Portuguese, and particularly those from the Minho region, will never give up eating pica no chão or arroz de cabidela ; they will never give up caldo verde and cozido à portugesa , accompanied by good local desserts and a bowl of vinho verde tinto .</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore welcome the amendments, the adjustments and the work done by the rapporteur. I agree with his point of view and his report, and I advocate that consumers should be aware and well informed, but that it should be their responsibility alone to decide what to eat.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are talking about food information to consumers. As Members of this House, we get information on many things and it is not so much the information, but what we do with it, that is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to address two specific points in this report. One is country of origin. We do have country of origin labelling for beef. Perhaps the Union would not have chosen to have it, but a crisis forced us to have it. It seems to have worked very effectively and very well. I support the idea that, particularly in relation to meat products, there is a need for country of origin information for consumers so that they know where their food comes from.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me move on to my second point, the issue where I would give an amber light. I have read – and indeed thank those who have given me the information – about traffic lights and GDAs, and I have tried to analyse this information extremely carefully. I have a number of points to make. We have health warnings on cigarette packs. I do not smoke, I think the warnings are wonderful and I will not smoke. Those who smoke continue to smoke through all the alarming warnings that are on the labels. Can I stress that labels will not make you thin. Labels will not reduce obesity. We need a much deeper discussion around this problem. We should ban lifts and cars so that we get more exercise, but we are hardly likely to take that particular route.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am glad this is a first reading. I think the issues are too complex to solve at this stage. We need a deeper debate and discussion and to come up with something that is in the best interests of the title of the report: ‘Food information to consumers’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur. Effective food labelling is indeed very important. Consumers need to know what they are eating, and they need to find that out in the brief time that they are in the supermarket doing their shopping. However, the information must be provided in such a way that you do not need a degree in food science to understand it. Our target group for this information is quite different, after all – it is not those who already have an excellent knowledge of how healthy different foods are.</p>
      <p sl="de">I consider one area to be particularly important, and that is the area of traditionally produced products, particularly products processed and marketed directly by the farmer. The contents of these products are often not standardised – I am thinking, for example, of jams and juices – and it is simply not possible to state information such as the precise sugar content or precise calorific values.</p>
      <p sl="de">In recent years, we have done a lot of work to reduce the distance travelled between farmer and consumer, and today, factors such as life on the farm, farmers’ markets, and so on are very important overall for the image of farmers and agriculture. We have also spent European money on promoting such things as part of our rural development programme. Moreover, in such sales, there is often a direct relationship between the farmer and the purchaser, and that is often more important than information on labels. Consequently, I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support those amendments that are aimed at finding a sensible solution for this category of sales.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that there are health problems in the European Union, nor is there any doubt that the interests of consumers must have priority or that food is unlike other commodities, in that it is something that we consume and put into our bodies. It is therefore obvious that we must take particular care when talking about foodstuffs and their labelling, and that the precautionary principle – as rooted in the treaty – must also apply here.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is naïve to think that we can solve these problems through food labelling. Take a look at the US: there are many overweight people in the US, and yet the Americans have the most stringent food labelling. Consequently, we need to give particular consideration to how to deal with this problem here in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore believe firstly that a traffic light system, as proposed, will not achieve our objectives – since the confusion it creates is greater than the information it provides. Secondly, however, it is also my belief that a GDA system, as has also been proposed, is very likely to provide the information that knowledge-seeking consumers will find useful for making the right choices.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I believe that country of origin labelling is important, particularly for foods. Most consumers want to know where their food comes from and where it was manufactured. Fourthly, I believe that health information must be scientifically based if it is to influence consumers’ decisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one final request to the Commissioner: we are still awaiting a Commission proposal on the financing of the EFSA. This is the only authority that charges no fees for its activities. Please would you tell us something about when we can expect this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today’s good news is that the new legislation will provide uniform, mandatory nutritional labelling that relates to 100 grams, thereby providing greater comparability. Statements of nutritional value provide consumers with information that allows them to make an informed purchasing decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying. Imitation products that are not clearly marked as such deliberately mislead consumers. Imitation cheese, pressed ham products, vanilla yoghurt that contains no vanilla whatsoever – these are just a few examples. All these imitation products must be labelled as such. I am pleased that we will send a clear signal to the Council tomorrow and that all of us here are agreed that we need better labelling.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as I am concerned, the task is to provide information; we should leave consumers to make up their own minds, however. That is why I am against traffic light labelling. There are no unhealthy foods – only unhealthy, unbalanced diets. The traffic lights are misleading. I am in favour of food labelling according to the GDA model and am pleased that we are likely to vote to move towards this tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Consumers must know what they are eating. That is why the Hungarian parties fully support the combined colour-coded hybrid labelling system. The National Association for Consumer Protection in Hungary also supports this scheme wholeheartedly. The combined colour-coded system is an excellent, easy to understand and unambiguous system. It allows the provision of authentic information and will help consumers choose healthier food products. In order to eliminate the concerns regarding the consumption of traditional products, we only recommend the utilisation of this labelling system for certain product categories. That is perfectly clear. We also support the specification of the country of origin as extensively as possible. We must confirm this regulation requiring country of origin specifications for single ingredient products such as fruit and vegetables, meat, fish and other foodstuffs.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while it is a priority for this Parliament to ensure that consumers have food that is safe and from a guaranteed, traceable source, it is just as much of a priority to promote easy access to food information through appropriate labelling systems. The adoption of clear, intelligible food labelling is a step in this direction and may, in fact, influence consumers’ choices by encouraging them to buy healthier products from a guaranteed source.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, I would like to ask this House to carefully examine an amendment that has been tabled and signed by 40 Members, Amendment 351, which calls for consumers to be given information not only on the origin of the raw materials used in some unprocessed agricultural products that arrive on our tables, but also on that of raw materials used in processed products comprising a single ingredient; in other words, those that contain an additive in addition to the agricultural product.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to make two points about this regulation. It is essential that we confirm tomorrow our vote on mandatory origin labelling of foodstuffs, which already exists for a large number of products: not only for fish, fruit and vegetables, but also for unprocessed beef, and this type of labelling has been around since the mad cow crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also ensure that this European regulation protects the investments of the very large number of SMEs which innovate and create employment. We must therefore get rid of all those measures which will not only fail to work, such as, for example, nutrient profiles, mentioned in Article 14, but which will also, clearly, prove to be a waste of time and money for entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to conclude very quickly with a question to our Commissioner, Mr Dalli. I should like to hear the view of the Commission on Amendment 205, dealt with at length by Mrs Grossetête, which envisages adding a label for animals which have been killed by ritual slaughter. As has already been said, this would stigmatise these products for no purpose and would be particularly counterproductive for this sector. I would like to know where the Commission stands on this very important issue.</p>

We consumers are entitled to a clear overview of the composition of the food that we buy without having to be trained chemists or clinical dieticians. We welcome the fact that the 100 gram and 100 millilitre declarations are to be stated on the front of the packaging, as statistics show that this is the information that consumers are looking for. We must not confuse consumers with far too many labelling schemes, nor should we destroy the regional diversity of food-producing areas by imposing a detailed labelling system for non-prepacked food. Neither should we put obstacles in the way of the many small and medium-sized enterprises that make up the food industry.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, my vision is that we should strengthen the power of consumers by providing clear, simple and comprehensible information on food without burdening small producers with more bureaucracy in the process. I am therefore opposed to any form of misleading labelling and falsification. I am opposed to the traffic light labelling system because it scares people and does not respect the fact that we all have different health requirements and lifestyles. For the same reasons, I am opposed to labelling of mandatory daily intake.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am in favour of the country of origin labelling of meat. The Commission must come up with proposals for practical solutions that can be evaluated and with regard to which we can then adopt a position.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have two opposing alternatives: either politicians preach from the top down and determine what we should eat or we get greater freedom of choice and the right to more information. I am in favour of a nutrient profile labelling system that is flexible and based on research. The food industry must take responsibility and must clean up its own act and work to eliminate things that result in poorer food. Food is a health issue and it is important to realise that. We need to work together for better food.</p>

      <p sl="el">I call on the House to vote in favour of Amendment 263, which states that it must be compulsory to list palm oil in foods which our fellow citizens find on supermarket shelves, so that our fellow citizens do not fund global deforestation, loss of biodiversity and climate change without wanting to do so and without knowing that they are doing so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, three million European schoolchildren are overweight and the number is increasing by a further 85 000 each year. Naturally, being overweight causes a range of chronic illnesses and that is why what we eat as food is important. In other words, we are what we eat. It is in the interests of consumers that we have clear, understandable food labelling that makes reference to certain ingredients. I therefore welcome the idea of providing all consumers with a quick idea of the fat, sugar and salt content of a product. What really does not belong in this regulation, however, is responsibility for the origin of the ingredients of a product. It is therefore important that someone assumes responsibility for where the ingredients used in a ready-made product come from. In this connection – in this sensitive segment of the market – it is also very important that we have sanctions in place: sanctions for those who deliberately deceive consumers and make false statements concerning the products and their ingredients.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are talking today about information, and information can be distributed all over the world at the press of a button. There is no shortage of information; rather, what is lacking is clear, brief and appropriate information.</p>
      <p sl="de">One thing is certain: a food label cannot be a manual for healthy eating. Knowledge of diet is something that must be communicated in the family, in schools and in communities. Everyone needs to have some basic knowledge if they are to be able to use the information on food labels to put together their own healthy diet. GDAs, nutritional profiles and health claims are not necessary on labels. Traffic lights that can be red and green at the same time – since high sugar and low fat are not mutually exclusive – are of no help to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Region of origin labelling is no longer appropriate in today’s world. Our dairy in the Eifel takes in milk from Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. So what is the country of origin of the cheese produced? Obviously, we must take action to prevent consumers being deceived. The label must state what is in the product, without any possibility of misunderstanding. A cheese substitute must be clearly recognisable as such and designated accordingly. A food additive, a piece of meat that has been stuck together, must not be sold as ham on the deli counter. I urge you to support the rapporteur’s proposals.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, good labelling on food products is vital. Information about the place of origin is important, as is information about the level of fat, sugar and salt. For this reason, if it is to be effective, the information must be clear and accessible and must only contain the essential facts. However, this does not mean that certain traditional products, which are, in many cases, an expression of the culture in specific regions of Europe, can or should not be exempt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to wine, I think that it should also be exempt for two reasons: firstly, it is a special product that is already covered by a specific regulation. Wine does not contain fat or sugar but alcohol, which is already graded in current labelling. Moreover, red wine is even recommended by the World Health Organisation. Secondly, the new labelling would only be detrimental to a sector of the economy that is already experiencing great difficulties.</p>

      <p sl="sk">First, I would like to applaud the work of the rapporteur, Renate Sommer, who, in drawing up the report, has focused on improving the directive drafted by the Commission. I firmly believe that we must focus on meaningfulness when indicating the nutritional value of foods. The necessary data must be stated in comparable values, and must not get lost in symbols and signs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must also focus on intelligibility. The main information should be stated on the front, so that it is clear at first sight. Supplementary information on ingredients may also be provided on the other side of the product.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must also focus on objectivity. Suppliers must be responsible for the accuracy of information on products, even under the threat of sanctions. Another aspect we must monitor is the legibility of the information. The size and thickness of the lettering mentioned in the Commission’s proposal are insufficient. The main information must be clear to the consumer at first sight.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As far as country of origin labelling is concerned, I can see a number of unresolved issues. Final producers often purchase semi-products on the market according to price, alternating between different suppliers in different countries, and these raw materials are then mixed together in the final product. I am talking about specific products, such as salami or sausages. In such cases, it will clearly be difficult to state the country of origin.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, this is an extremely important consumer protection issue. A recent opinion poll indicates that European citizens believe that the food safety situation has deteriorated over the last 10 years, and one consumer in three still does not trust the quality of produce. It is imperative, therefore, to bring up to date, simplify and clarify food labelling in the European Union so as to ensure that consumers are better protected.</p>

It is a very important legal standard, especially from the perspective of the health of Europeans, which is the first priority. Today, it is beyond doubt that many diseases and lifestyle-related conditions are connected with poor nutrition, and we must therefore approach this problem on a conceptual basis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to emphasise that consumers must get clear and transparent information on the nutritional value of a product, but must then make their own decisions. Our aim is to tell consumers what is, not what should be. I therefore consider the system of traffic light labelling to be superficial and rather inadequate.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank you for this lively and interesting debate which generated such strong views on many areas of the proposal. These views will, of course, be carefully considered by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are certain issues that we believe are fundamental for consumers – for example, availability of information on allergens on all food; front-of-pack nutrition labelling with endorsement of additional labelling by Member States; the inclusion of measurable criteria for legibility; and balanced information concerning consumer health. I would like to emphasise once again my strong support for the principle of nutrient profiles, and would stress that we will not be stopping the production of any food and that work on this will proceed in an open-minded manner. The Commission cannot accept deletion of this provision from the Claims Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like, if I may, to react to some of the issues that were raised here today. On the EFSA financing, I can say that we are working at the moment on a non-legislative report which should be ready after the summer and which will state what our direction will be in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">On innovation, I believe that our proposals are not against innovation. I am in favour of innovation – as is the Commission – but it must be responsible innovation. We want innovation that works for the consumers and innovation that works for consumers’ health.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of the claims made and the approvals mentioned by Mr Davies, I must state that, under Article 13, we did have about 44 000 claims by Member States. When we asked Member States to revise these claims, they were reduced to 4 000. This indicates to me the lax and superficial way in which claims are made and why it is important that we control these claims that, as I have said, are made as a marketing tool to sell products. In fact, this process has been slightly delayed because of the volumes, but we are working on batches. The first batch has been completed by EFSA and is being reviewed by the Commission for publication, and the second batch is also well advanced at EFSA. This is an ongoing process. On the other hand, 50 claims have already been judged under Article 14, and the Commission has pronounced itself in favour or against. Work on this is therefore progressing – we have been delayed but the work is going on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make another comment on the impact assessments. The Commission has supported this proposal with wide consultation of stakeholders and a terrain impact assessment weighing the cost and benefits of the various policy options. The impact of several amendments tabled by honourable Members today and in the past to add extra labelling requirements has not been subject to any assessment. For the sake of better regulation, I believe that impact assessment should underpin the decision-making process at all times.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to end by again thanking Mrs Renate Sommer and all honourable Members for their contributions. A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is, as usual, being made available to Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">The debate that we are tackling today is especially important.</p>
      <p sl="it">European law provides a series of regulations and directives on food ingredients and labelling. At present, however, no coordinated labelling requirement exists among the Member States. It seems clear that the large number of generic European rules on food information makes it difficult for European consumers to find clear guidance. Instead of plugging the gaps as they are intended to do, the individual Member States’ additional regulations have hindered trade within the European Union internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">For these reasons, I believe that only a uniform, Europe-wide food labelling system can hope to eliminate these problems. Mandatory labelling must be presented in a comprehensible format so that consumers can make informed purchases. Consumers do indeed continue to occupy a special place in our decision-making process when it comes to safeguarding both their health and the quality of the goods that they buy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must stress the importance of safeguarding European businesses from all forms of counterfeiting and unfair competition while, at the same time, promoting a reduction in red tape. Stating the name of the producer on food packaging is also essential information for the purposes of promoting the European food industry’s competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Sommer report is crucial not only for giving consumers clear information but also for avoiding distortion of the market and acting as a catalyst for the European economy, through transparent mechanisms and the uniform application of rules within the EU. It is a surprise, then, to see the re-emergence of attempts, in the form of changes to the session, to integrate wine into this scheme of labelling with information on energy values and sugar levels.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is already mandatory for wine labels to mention a number of things, and adding new requirements means that they would become overloaded, difficult to read and of negligible practical value. The special requirements for labelling on wine can be explained historically by the fact that this is a highly regulated product with certain qualities. For this reason, it should come under the proposed five year exemption, which will allow a careful analysis of the information that labels should include. The financial crisis currently affecting Europe means that prudence is required in a context where the wine sector is primarily composed of small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition to the already heavy costs of quality production, this will be an extra requirement with little practical use. Given this, I believe it is inopportune and mistaken to label wine according to the regulation currently under consideration.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report on food labelling has the aim of unifying seven existing directives and one regulation, and clarifying current regulations at the European and national levels. The current disharmony causes uncertainty and confusion over the information stated on foods regarding ingredients and nutritional values. The side effects of these changes towards unified food labelling in the EU include boosting the competitiveness of European producers, and promoting healthy eating among the population at large. I fundamentally disagree with the Commission’s proposal to leave it largely to the Member States to make their own legal arrangements. This would lead to further fragmentation and disunity in the internal market for food, and would completely nullify the main aim of the regulation, which is to have unified and clear food labelling. The Commission’s proposal for 3 mm lettering would, in many cases, be unworkable in practice. Compliance with this would mean changing the sizes of individual packaging, which logically entails higher costs for producing the packaging, transporting the products packaged in this way and warehousing the products, as well as higher costs for the food and for the environmental disposal of the packaging. The Commission has completely overlooked small farmers and the direct sale of unpackaged products. It is unacceptable for the Commission to present us with such unbalanced and incomplete proposals which fail to take account of the latest scientific developments. I agree in principle with the modified version of the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I will therefore be voting in favour of this new version.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today, we are voting on a regulation that is designed to safeguard consumers by guaranteeing their right to information about the food sold to them, so that they can make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are not here to dictate what European citizens must eat. Therefore, we cannot accept approaches such as traffic light or nutrient profile labelling that give foods the green light or the red light on the basis of so-called health principles which, apart from anything else, do not take account of gastronomic traditions or local specialities. What is more, leading nutritionists believe that there is no such thing as good foods and bad foods, but only good diets and bad diets, depending on how individual foods are combined in a person’s overall diet. Both the traffic light and nutrient profile models overlook the fact that the human body also needs these much maligned fats, sugar and salt in order to function properly.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should also like to draw attention to the need to specify the origin of foodstuffs. We are well aware that in some countries, ingredients may be used that are harmful to health and poor hygiene standards may be tolerated in the production sector. We must protect those businesses, too, that pride themselves on the quality and wholesomeness of their products. With our vote, we can make some major progress in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="de">We have spent around EUR 90 million on the EU campaign to promote a healthy diet for European school children. The aim is to encourage children to eat healthily by offering them free fruit. So we are spending millions on drumming it into the heads of children that they should eat apples and other fruit. Then we plan to introduce a food labelling system in which foods with a low sugar, fat and salt content would have a green traffic light on the label and those with a high content a red traffic light. All of a sudden, those apples which we have supplied at a cost of millions of euros would have a red label because of their sugar content and would therefore be seen as being unhealthy. The kids would probably not find anything very complimentary to say about the EU if this were the case. Even those people who do not think about what they eat have finally got the message that consuming excessive amounts of convenience foods, biscuits, sweets and alcohol is unhealthy. For all the people who want to take their health into consideration when buying food, or who are forced to do so because of an illness, a complete list of ingredients is much more important. This will make it easier for diabetics, for example, to calculate the number of bread units, instead of having to guess how much insulin to inject. For the 10% or so of consumers who apparently read the nutrition labelling, the calorific value and calorie content are the ideal solution. In contrast, a confusing colour-coded system does not really serve a useful purpose.</p>

      <p sl="en">Many European citizens suffer from diet-related health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. And cases of these conditions – which are often preventable – are on the rise. A heavy reliance on processed and convenience foods, combined with a lack of accessible information about their contents, means that consumers do not always make healthy choices about their diet – even if they want to. We have a right to clear, accurate information about what we are eating, and it should be easy to compare different products, especially in terms of their fat, sugar and salt contents. The labelling standards, particularly the colour coding which I will be supporting in tomorrow’s vote, will help both those who have specific dietary needs, as well as those who are conscious of their general diet, to make the right choices. Education about diet and nutrition alone is not enough – it must be backed up with accessible and reliable information which people can easily use. This is vital to ensuring that people can make the right choices about their diet, and is one of the best ways we can tackle the diet-related diseases which are so prominent across the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, which will be put to the vote today during the plenary sitting of the European Parliament, is another step towards enabling consumers to obtain the information they need about a product and thereby make an informed decision about whether to buy it. On the strength of this legislation, the Union will introduce a system of food labelling which will be mandatory in all Member States. It is an example of good legislation, which rationalises the current system of seven directives and one regulation. Harmonisation of legislation at European level means that the correct functioning of the common market will be guaranteed by enabling consumers to make informed choices, while at the same time ensuring legal protection for producers. The multiplicity of different systems of food labelling only causes unnecessary doubts among consumers when making purchases, while the information which is given is often illegible or not displayed properly on the packaging. This is especially important in view of the obesity epidemic in Europe. Mrs Sommer’s report is intended to change this situation, and so I am going to vote in favour of its adoption.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate is an important political signal that the European Parliament wants to send in these times. The tabling of this oral question in the midst of the process of redesigning Eurostat and drawing up the European Parliament’s statement to the Commission is also a sign of our determination.</p>
      <p sl="de">In submitting a separate resolution, we are demonstrating that the European Parliament needs and wants Eurostat to act independently and comprehensively. This is the first direct response by the legislature to experiences in and with Greece. At the same time, we should not forget that in 2005, the Council rejected Commissioner Almunia’s Five Point Plan and thereby prevented the Commission from being equipped with the necessary instruments. We are catching up with what we could have done, and needed to do, long ago. Consequently, I would like to remind both the Commission and the Council that the political will exists to evolve all the instruments needed to ensure that the euro is supported not only by the pillar of monetary union, but also by the pillar of economic union. I call on the Council not to block, not to delay, not to prevent, but rather to give the Commission this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also want to know whether any investigations are being made into where Eurostat and/or the Member States have acted incorrectly in recent years, since it is only once we have a clear analysis that we can know which corrections and additions need to be made.</p>
      <p sl="de">What does the European Parliament want? We want independence, we want comparability – and therefore minimum standards for collecting statistics, minimum standards for the institutional structure of the authorities and cooperation with the ECB. We want all actions to be able to be checked, which is why Eurostat must be able to carry out unannounced checks at any time. We want its powers to be extended because we want insight into all the data – including that at regional and municipal level and for social security. We want seamless cooperation, we want to strengthen the coordination function and we want the Commission to tell us before we conclude our report whether everything that has been agreed with the Council so far is sufficient. We do not think so. We are talking about a minimum declaration, catching up with what has not been done, taking the next step towards greater independence and more comprehensive powers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is consistent and united in its view that Eurostat has to be strengthened and we have, for a long time, been in pursuit of establishing higher quality statistical data.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know the history as Mr Karas has already referred to it. In 2005, the Council brought shame on itself and sowed the seed of the current sovereign debt problems by weakening the Stability and Growth Pact and simultaneously denying audit powers to Eurostat. With that history, it takes time to regain trust, and lack of trust contributed to why, in the recent troubles, Member States had to put a lot of cash on the table. Words and political commitments by the Ecofin Council were not enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Soon, we will at last have audit power for Eurostat, all the more important now because it is the key that can make other plans about economic surveillance effective. A tool to get a grip on an outturn is so much better than just a grip on promises.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want the quality of data to be improved, for it to be timely, and we want to be able to examine upstream input to national accounts, and we ask: is the new power given to Eurostat sufficient? Even now, the Ecofin Council has added in some conditionality to the new auditing power, actually less restricting than many of us feared, but has it undermined the possibility for really early investigation and intervention?</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament’s report favours unconditional rights for Eurostat to do so-called methodological visits. Of course, resources must be targeted where needed, but investigation needs to happen at the time of suspicion, not after the event.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, when will we know that like is truly compared with like? What progress is being made to ensure that accounting procedures are standardised and sufficiently transparent to capture off-balance-sheet activity and any other innovative practices?</p>

    <intervention id="2-112" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first thank Mr Karas, Ms Bowles and others for raising these very important issues concerning the quality of statistical data and Eurostat. Let me also welcome the support expressed in your draft opinion for the Commission proposal to amend the Regulation on the Application of the Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me point out that this is the very first legislative proposal of Mr Barroso’s second Commission in February. I am glad that it will soon be adopted, I trust, and we will then have it in our arsenal. We needed it a long time ago, as Ms Bowles said.</p>
      <p sl="en">The original proposal to this effect was made in 2005, but it was then rejected by the Member States. Times have changed and now we have broad support for this in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards this proposal, the general approach agreed upon by the Ecofin Council on 8 June last week confirms the importance of ensuring high quality statistics on government debt and deficit and acknowledges the role of the Commission and Eurostat for that purpose.</p>
      <p sl="en">The regulation being finalised preserves the main objective of the proposal put forward by the Commission, namely, granting more audit powers to Eurostat when a significant risk or problem with the quality of data has been identified. The Commission can, therefore, accept the compromise text.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission intends to take several further steps with regard to strengthening the quality of European statistics for the EDP. There will be an immediate reinforcement of staff resources dealing with this work, mainly by internal redeployment within Eurostat. Member States will be visited more regularly than at present in the so-called EDP Dialogue Visits.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will ensure the integration of more information on source data for compiling statistics into the EDP inventories foreseen by the regulation. Should there arise an exceptional case where significant risks or problems with respect to the quality of the data have been clearly identified, Eurostat will use all the relevant powers at its disposal under the new rules, including, of course, the audit powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before concluding, let me say a few words about Greece on some topical issues. I wish to use this opportunity and maybe take a minute more of your time. As is well known, the Commission has undertaken in-depth work on Greek statistics over several years. The amended regulation should, in future, better mitigate the risk of fraud or manipulation of statistics, or of any other kind of irregularity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday, there was a new development concerning Greece. You will know that Moody’s decided to downgrade Greek bonds yesterday. I have discussed this also with my colleague Michel Barnier and the Commission President. I must say that the timing of Moody’s decision is both surprising and highly unfortunate, coming after the agreement on a macro-economic adjustment programme between Greece and the Commission, the ECB and the IMF.</p>
      <p sl="en">The measures taken by the Greek Government illustrate their commitment to implement the strategy to reform the statistical system, to stabilise their public finances and to restore long-term sustainable economic growth. This decision of Moody’s seems inconsistent with the evolution of Greek sovereign bond deals and CDS spreads, which have narrowed significantly since the agreement on the programme. This again raises issues relating to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system and prudential regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">These issues and others will be taken into consideration in the Commission’s thinking on the future of credit rating agencies. In particular, the Commission will look in the coming months at the issues of the level of competition in this sector – highly concentrated for the time being – as well as at the transparency regarding methodology and the conflict of interests, since the system remains based on the payer-issuer model.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that it is of absolute importance that we have accurate and reliable statistical data on national accounts. It is one of the cornerstones of a properly and effectively functioning economic and monetary union, as was underlined for instance by Mr Karas. Hence, this amendment on Eurostat’s powers is part and parcel of reinforcing economic governance in Europe, which is indeed a necessary objective.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am glad that the Commission has provided legislative proposals to bolster Eurostat that are currently being scrutinised by the ECON Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">The quality of statistical governance lies at the heart of the crisis in the eurozone. There is no doubt in my mind that Eurostat should have wider powers, in particular, to make on-site inspections in Member States. But such inspections should not just be with officials from the Member State’s Finance Ministry or with national statistical authorities or even with state-owned corporations: they should include, if the work deems these relevant, academic economists, trade unions, NGOs, etc. This is something which rating agencies, or even IMF delegations, do as a matter of fact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we must have a common system of accounting – used by all Member States, based on a standardised and internationally accepted method of accounting, and agreed between the Member States, Commission and Parliament. This should not apply just to financial reports as provided to the Commission but they should also be used in the Member States’ public sectors themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over a decade after the creation of the eurozone and the introduction of the euro, we have discovered basic flaws in the system that are causing damage. These flaws we ignored, ironically, because of the false sense of security created by a successful euro. We must ensure that in the future, markets trust governments’ economic forecasts and statistics. We must correct these flaws, and fast.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore urge the Commission to continue to work closely with Parliament and Council to resolve these problems as a matter of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, the current crisis in the euro area cannot, of course, be attributed to the shortcomings of the common statistical system. Nonetheless, these shortcomings have had serious consequences. There are the economic consequences, and we have heard a great deal about them, but there are also consequences in terms of the credibility of the European Union. Here we are broaching what is, in my view, one of the major problems with the way in which the Union operates today. Governments make promises to their citizens, and rightly so; they say that mutual undertakings will be strictly monitored, that the criteria will be examined down to the very last decimal point – in the original German, that equates to drei komma null – but these very same governments have, year after year, refused to give Eurostat the resources it needs to do its job. All this is to the detriment of the common good, as anything that weakens the Commission weakens us all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we wholeheartedly support this resolution, which calls for the Commission, Eurostat, to be granted investigative powers, and common standards to be strengthened. Without this effort to ensure rigour in the use and compilation of data, the promises of rigour will not be kept. Europeans will feel increasingly at sea and it will be the European Union that loses face.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the debate on enhanced powers for Eurostat does not really address the problem. We must never again find ourselves in a situation in which a Member State plays tricks with its budget data and lives beyond its means for years at the expense of others; where there are reasons to doubt data, the data must be verified. However, the EU must not use Greece and the current euro crisis as an excuse to completely remove powers of budgetary sovereignty from the Member States. Rather, the problem must be rooted out.</p>
      <p sl="de">The socio-economic structures of the Member States vary greatly in some instances. Even Eurostat, which juggles the figures for the EU, must realise this. An unemployed person in London is not the same as an unemployed person in Paris, because different criteria apply. The differences in socio-economic realities between the traditional hard currency and soft currency countries are even more striking.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by expressing my total satisfaction about the comment you made earlier about yesterday’s sudden and unwarranted decision by the Moody’s credit rating agency to downgrade Greece’s credit rating, a decision which you called unfortunate and erroneous, thereby confirming that our decision to proceed with a radical review of the operating framework of these firms in European territory and to seriously examine the possibility of creating a public European credit rating agency was correct.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards today’s debate and the proposal to review the regulation on the quality of statistical data within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure, we all know that this follows on from the so-called ‘Greek affair’ in terms of false statistics.</p>
      <p sl="el">As a Greek MEP, I obviously do not feel happy that Greece is used as an example to avoid in such a debate. However, I wish to remind the House – as you did Commissioner – that Greece, the current Greek Government, was the first to recognise the problem and immediately took radical decisions to deal with it, first of all by converting the National Statistics Office into a fully independent authority supervised by Parliament and, secondly, by taking steps to set up an examining committee to investigate and apportion blame to those involved in this unacceptable procedure.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nonetheless, we must recognise that this debate is belated at European level, as there have been adequate statistics which should have galvanised us into action since 2005.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Which criteria singled out the most stable Member State in the Balkans when all the other Member States in the Balkans are experiencing great difficulties? What were these criteria which determined that an audit should be carried out specifically in Bulgaria?

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, there are simple measures that need to be taken to create economic stability within the EU. One of the simplest but, at the same time, important measures is to increase the quality of the economic statistics. In this area, it is perfectly possible to achieve significant improvements relatively quickly. I therefore welcome the positive signals sent out by both the Commission and the Council. My hope is that it will be possible to quickly reach agreement on effective packages of measures that will take the quality of the statistics to a higher level.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I believe that we need to strengthen the role and powers of Eurostat. Eurostat must also continue to cooperate with the national producers of statistics, but the hierarchy and levels of decision making need to be made clearer. Eurostat must be able to demand to see correct national data and must be able to make use of both sanctions and special inspections if the quality is not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Greater resources are needed if the statistics are to improve. It is important for us to realise that higher quality requires greater investment in this regard. We need to establish a plan for Eurostat. Its capacity must be increased and we need to ensure that the budget provides room for this increase in capacity.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are all aware that the amendment of the regulation as regards the quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure is a particularly important and urgent measure in view of the present problems in most of the national budgets of the Member States. Without precise, clear data, it is difficult to decide on and establish further measures. To this extent, a control mechanism needs to be put in place that allows the data submitted by the national authorities to be verified in good time. In any event, we must never again find ourselves in a situation – such as we did with Greece – in which it is only in retrospect that it becomes apparent that decisions with wide-ranging implications were taken on the basis of incorrect or falsified data. We must also consider penalties for those states that deliberately communicate incorrect data or statistics. The enhancement of Eurostat and its expansion into an independent authority should therefore be considered in any event. This is not interfering with the budgetary sovereignty of the Member States at all, but rather is about having effective checks on data.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I think the Commission should be thanked for making such speedy headway with regard to these issues. Only a few months ago, for example, looking into a country’s statistical data was felt to be an intrusion with regard to national sovereignty. At the time, it was considered to be virtually impossible and now we have obviously come a long way. It is excellent that Eurostat’s powers are to be increased. Europe would have drifted into a sort of moral crisis, if people had, as it were, merely noticed out of the corner of their eye that the statistics were being distorted.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I agree with my colleague, Mrs Podimata, that people should now stop ridiculing Greece in this way. Greece should be respected for taking some very tough decisions. The people there should also have better access than before to statistical data and general information on the economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me thank you for a very substantive debate and your support for this proposal to reinforce Eurostat’s powers. I must say that I agree with Mrs Jaakonsaari that we have seen a sea change – a real cultural change – as regards the attitudes concerning economic policy coordination in Europe in recent months.</p>
      <p sl="en">The adoption of this proposal is one of the cornerstones of our efforts to reinforce our economic and monetary union. There were several points made concerning Greece and Bulgaria, and I would like to clarify and respond to some of the issues that were discussed today. On Greece, I will not go into the whole long history of this saga. I agree with those who say that it is not fair to continue this ‘Greece bashing’, because Greece is now on track and its programme is being implemented effectively. Greece deserves credit and support, not ‘bashing’. As regards the statistical reforms, we are working together with the Greek authorities. We have made numerous visits in the course of this winter and spring and have recently agreed on an action plan which aims at enhancing the capacity of the Greek statistical system and improving Greece’s public finance statistics.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Bulgaria, our concerns relate mostly to two aspects of the budgetary forecast. I trust that at least the Bulgarian Members of the European Parliament are listening to my clarifications concerning Bulgaria’s excessive deficit procedure and statistical problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the Commission was only belatedly informed by Bulgaria about the sizeable revisions in the budgetary outlook, in violation of treaty obligations. Secondly, we lack information on why Bulgaria revised its planned budget for 2010 from a balanced budget to a deficit of 3.8% within just a few weeks, even though the macro-economic scenario remained unchanged or even improved. Consequently, the Commission is currently not in a position to undertake an assessment of the Bulgarian budgetary plans for this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The planned mission by Eurostat to Bulgaria foreseen for the second half of this year will not address the differences and questions concerning the 2010 outlook. This is not a statistical issue. Instead, Eurostat will focus on potential risks to past data on the excessive deficit procedure for the year 2009 relating to previously undeclared government contractual commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very grateful for this attention to these important issues, which may have also some implications concerning Bulgaria’s standing in the markets. According to the information obtained from the Bulgarian authorities, the conclusion of their internal budget audits will only be completed by mid-summer. The outcome of such audits will be used by Eurostat in the context of the planned EDP visit to Bulgaria. Depending on the speed of the adoption of the revised regulation, which grants stronger powers to Eurostat, Eurostat may draw on these powers, as necessary, in its work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ladies and gentlemen, once again, thank you for your attention and especially for your broad and strong support for our proposal, which is the very first legislative proposal of the second Barroso Commission. Indeed, its adoption is essential for the effective functioning of economic and monetary union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Parliament must take a stand on a very important issue in today’s debate, namely, the direction the statistical information system currently operating under the authority of Eurostat should take in order to avoid situations similar to the Greek scandal in the future. Let me remind you that the fraud perpetrated by the Greek authorities had already come to light in 2004, and around the same time, the Socialist-led Hungarian Government’s finances were shady as well. Despite this, the EU has still not taken any steps to reform the statistical information system. Although I believe that the Commission’s plan to grant audit rights to Eurostat is a step in the right direction, I am convinced that we will have to do more, as the future of the common currency is now at stake. What do I think we should do next? In my opinion, in excessive deficit procedures, sanctions should not only be imposed on Member States repeatedly failing to comply with their obligation to meet the 3% Maastricht budget deficit criterion, but also on those who have provided false statistical data for years, misleading investors and the EU and jeopardising the stability of the euro area. I agree with the approach of making the officers of national statistical offices personally responsible for the quality of data provided to Eurostat. This is why I propose that, taking into account the work being done by the Council’s working group under the direction of Herman Van Rompuy, we ask the Commission to work out a more stringent system of sanctions to replace the one currently in place.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have prepared a short statement for today, which I should like to read.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a great honour for me to be nominated Vice-President of the European Parliament with the support of the European People’s Party. It was a similar honour to receive the highest state decoration of Romania, the Order of the Star, in December 2009, at the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the fall of Communist dictatorship in Romania. Twenty years ago in Timişoara, people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and different beliefs, united by understanding and courage and facing and running the same risks together, rose up against the Ceauşescu regime. In the same way as back then, I continue my efforts today to represent my country’s interests in the spirit of the fight for human, minority and religious rights and for freedom, while remaining committed to European and Christian values.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am committed to furthering the European integration of former Communist countries and nations in the Eastern and Central European region, in particular, that of the Hungarian minority community in Romania that I represent as a member of the European People’s Party. It fills me with joy to be a Member of the European Parliament in the period following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which marks a new beginning in the history of a United Europe.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the incentive for this report on transparency in regional policy and its funding was the fact that the full disclosure of EU fund recipients enables public participation in a meaningful debate on how European public money is spent. This is necessary for the functioning of democracy at European level.</p>
      <p sl="el">This report, which was allocated to me by the Committee on Regional Development, contains recommendations which should be included in future regulations on the Structural Funds, such as the provision of additional information needed when publishing lists of recipients and sufficiently binding rules for partnership.</p>
      <p sl="el">Other proposals which can be implemented within the framework of current cohesion programmes are, for example:</p>
      <p sl="el">the definition by the Commission of a more detailed and prescriptive format specifying the structure, form and content of the information to be provided;</p>
      <p sl="el">also, linking the European transparency initiative with the new financial controls and auditing;</p>
      <p sl="el">a tougher line by auditors on communication and information requirements, including ‘naming and shaming’ and the use of financial corrections in confirmed cases of fraud;</p>
      <p sl="el">closer involvement of regional and local authorities and other relevant partners in all the phases of cohesion programming and implementation and full access for them to all project documentation;</p>
      <p sl="el">more guidance from the Commission on how to put the partnership clause into practice under current programmes and improving transparency in respect of EU funding of major projects.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like once again to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for this final text which we were able to achieve.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I know colleagues do not like people speaking at this particular time, but I beg their indulgence for a few short minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, because this was not debated in the House, it is important that something should be said about it, particularly because of the part played by the European Union International Fund for Ireland. Secondly, most people in Ireland – and beyond Ireland – think this fund was largely funded by the USA. Of course, the USA played a huge part – and I would like to thank them for that – as did Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but it is important to point out that, in the period 2006 onwards, the European Union is actually funding 57% of the Fund. That is not something that is widely known and, of course, having no debate on it here in Parliament meant that we kept it a secret. So I would like to highlight the part played by the European Union in helping to create contact, dialogue and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, which thankfully, though still fragile as a peace process, is still holding.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to pay tribute today to all the people who contributed to peace in Northern Ireland – there are so many – and particularly, I suppose, on the extremes. Parties like Dr Ian Paisley’s party – he was a member of this House for many years – and Gerry Adams’ party, who would never have been seen to come together 20 years ago, have come together in the peace process and power sharing. The European Union must take credit for this – at least its due share – and I want to highlight that today. I would like to pay tribute to all those who have taken risks for peace in Northern Ireland, and I hope that peace will continue.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I hope that this resolution will be passed unanimously, and I applaud each person involved for the part they played in the peace process in my own country.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I see that unlike President Buzek, you do not suffer from poor lateral vision and you were able to see me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have a very short point of order. Mr Martin’s report is intended to sort out problems concerning adaptation to the Treaty of Lisbon, but among the different amendments that we are required to vote on, there is one that is not related in any way to the Treaty of Lisbon and, as I see it, goes against the general principles of Parliamentary procedure. It is the amendment that deprives non-attached Members of the power to appoint their own representatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very serious matter regardless of your political opinions. To hand responsibility over to the President of Parliament, however impartial he may be, for selecting a Member to represent the non-attached Members at the Conference of Presidents, based on goodness only knows what criteria, instead of to the non-attached Members themselves, I truly think goes against the general principles of law and against the case-law of the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For this reason, Mr President, I consider that this amendment should be withdrawn from the list of amendments we are voting on today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I do not want to delay the House, but before we conclude this item, there are two technical points to be dealt with.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, this process started last November. We need to add a new citation to link last November’s vote with this vote, and I would ask the House to agree that we add the words ‘having regard to its decision of 25 November 2009 on the adaptation of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure to the Lisbon Treaty’. This is just, as I said, a technical point.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second such point is that we currently say that these rules should come into force on 1 December 2009. Clearly, that is not possible, and therefore I ask that we apply the normal Rule 212(3), which means that the rules would come into force on the first day of the next part-session.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr Tőkés obtained 334 votes, more than the absolute majority of 168. The electronic voting system is used as an alternative to a vote with ballot papers. On a ballot paper for an election, voters can only vote in favour of a candidate or a fixed number of candidates. There is never any possibility of voting against, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt explained. Voters not wishing to vote in favour leave the ballot paper blank. Therefore, I welcome Pastor Tőkés to the Bureau.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, just to understand, what you are telling us is that, for the vote on a Vice-President, it is impossible ever not to get a qualified majority, because, if you can only vote in favour or be taken down as abstention, and if abstentions do not count towards the total vote, then by definition, you always get a qualified majority.

      <p sl="unknown">As you recall, Mr Lambrinidis, at the beginning of this Parliament, there were in fact three ballots in order to elect all the Vice-Presidents on a qualified majority, so that was the procedure we followed on that occasion. On this occasion, there was only one candidate and, given that he received more than 168 votes, he got more than the qualified majority and is therefore elected on a single vote. This procedure is an unusual one, but we have followed the rules.</p>

      <p sl="pl">My name is Senyszyn.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These explanations are, nevertheless, absolutely unsatisfactory, taking into account the fact that before the vote, we were told that votes against and abstentions would be counted together, which is in accordance with the requirement for a qualified majority. After all, what do we mean by a ‘qualified majority’? It means there must be more votes in favour than the sum of votes against and abstentions. In this case, there is no clarity at all as to what the result of the vote was. Mr Buzek said there were 334 votes in favour, 287 votes against and 168 abstentions. In relation to this, it does indeed look as if 789 people voted, and now the explanations that some votes do not count may mean that it is some of the 334 votes in favour which do not count.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is an absolutely unacceptable situation, in the context of the definition in most countries. I do not think that in our Parliament, it should happen to be different. ‘Qualified majority’ or ‘absolute majority’ means more votes in favour than votes against and abstentions. In this instance this situation did not exist at all, because an erroneous number of votes were cast. This means the voting machine was not working properly and the vote absolutely must be taken again.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if you will indulge me, I actually have two points of order. The first is on the vice-presidential vote. There is no way that this can be a safe vote. We were misled as to the instructions. In this row here, we attempted to vote negatively, and the machines would not allow us to do so. We tried to raise points of order, which were not taken at the time, so I would call for a recall of this vote by a paper vote or a straightforward, yes/abstain/no vote with the results firmly displayed.

In view of the large number of people who were watching, we have really given an extremely poor public impression.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was extremely pleased, but not surprised, at the overwhelming vote in favour, which has been consistent throughout the debates on the International Fund for Ireland. Of course, the EU is one of the main contributors to the IFI’s inception in 1986, when it was established by the London and Dublin governments to promote economic and social development in the 12 counties on both sides of the border.</p>
      <p sl="ga">More than EUR 800 million in contributions have been paid into the fund, and when the multiplier effect is taken into account, this equates to an investment in excess of EUR 2 billion.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I am from a border county myself and I am a representative of the border region and, as such, I have a very good understanding of the part the International Fund for Ireland played in the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="ga">More than 40 000 direct jobs and 16 000 indirect jobs have been created with the help of the International Fund and it has created employment opportunities in an economically disadvantaged region.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In conclusion, while a sunset strategy has been agreed to take the work of the IFI to the end of this year, I do believe that every consideration should be given to prolonging this worthwhile and effective programme. Thank you for your indulgence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, no country has been so disadvantaged by the bail-outs as Ireland, and no people has been so hard done by as the Irish. The Irish Finance Minister, Brian Lenihan, made all the right decisions. Every Irish public servant from the Taoiseach to the lowest civil servant, and even the recipients of unemployment benefit, have tightened their belts and taken huge cuts in income. Now they find that, if they had made none of those painful decisions – if they had just carried on spending – they might have qualified, like the Greeks, for a bail-out of their own and, worse than that, they discover that they are obliged to participate in rescuing Greece. In fact, not only that, but they discover that in per capita terms, Ireland is making a greater contribution than most of the other eurozone members.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every orthodox economist would suggest that what we need to do at a time like this is to allow some of the eurozone economies to print their own currencies again, to devalue, to buy themselves time to price themselves back into the market. Instead, we are condemning the peoples of southern Europe to years of poverty and deflation and loading the taxpayers of northern Europe with an enormous debt, all in order to save a few faces. Surely we have the most expensive faces since that of Helen of Troy, which launched a thousand ships!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it was not my intention to make an explanation of vote on this particular issue, but during his speech, the rapporteur referred only to Dr Paisley and Mr Adams, saying that they brought the peace to Northern Ireland. Well, Mr Adams and Dr Paisley may have brought a lot of things but peace they never brought. A lot of people may claim peace in Northern Ireland but it was really David Trimble and John Hume who bore the brunt of the heavy lifting to bring the peace to Northern Ireland, and I hope the rapporteur will get his facts right in the future. They did all the heavy lifting in the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make it clear that I voted in favour of this today because I believe that in Northern Ireland today, we still need support to maintain what has been achieved.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I was among the 334 Members of the European Parliament who endorsed Pastor Tőkés for the position of Vice-President of the European Parliament. He is a hero of my younger days. As a journalist for Solidarity in 1989 and under fire from the criminal Securitate security service of Ceauşescu, I reported on the Romanian revolution, and that revolution started in Timişoara with a speech made by Mr Tőkés on 16 December 1989.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, it grieves me that today, he has been the victim, first of a computer error which wrongly counted 168 votes, and that then those 168 votes were added by the person chairing the proceedings to the overall total, which has been the cause of general controversy. Therefore, if people are going to call into question the legality of Mr Tőkés’ election as Vice-President of the European Parliament, then I am in favour of taking the vote again. I am certain his result will be even better. The mandate of such a distinguished person in the European Parliament must not be questioned by anyone. So I think that it is in the interest of Mr Tőkés himself, if anyone is going to raise doubts, to repeat the vote.</p>

I put it to you, Mr President, that it was only a matter of time. This is, of course, precisely the approach that the EU has taken in successive referendums.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Constitution or Lisbon Treaty was continuously rejected in the polls, by 54% of French voters, by 62% of Dutch voters, by 53% of Irish voters, and the reaction on each occasion was to go ahead regardless, to disregard what objections people had made, to hear only ‘yes’ where people had voiced their opposition. Now we have enshrined or regularised that approach in the procedures of this House. We have made it impossible for people to register their dissent from the project.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in looking at this report today about the procedure and the adaptation of procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon, it is interesting that we speak to many Members of the Parliament themselves and they do not really know what is actually in the Treaty of Lisbon and how it impacts on our voters in everyday life.</p>
      <p sl="en">Take, for example, the whole bail-out of Greece. If you look at what has been debated in Council, it is Article 122 of the Lisbon Treaty, which was supposed to be an article of solidarity: ‘In the spirit of solidarity if a Member State falls into difficulties in the supply of certain products such as in the area of energy or where a Member State is in difficulty or threatened with severe difficulties due to natural disasters’. That is now being used as an excuse for Member States, whether they are members of the eurozone or not, to bail out a country that has got itself into a mess of its own making and not because of exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should be quite clear with the electorate what the Lisbon Treaty means for the voters. Does it mean taking taxpayers’ money to bail out countries that cannot manage their own affairs?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this Parliament has a particular talent when it comes to reforms of the Rules of Procedure, which are always designed to diminish the rights of the minority, or underdogs, Untermenschen , that we are to some extent. For the past year, we have been riding roughshod over the rule that, under the terms of Rule 24 of the Rules of Procedure, allows non-attached Members to appoint their own representative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a remark which was – I am sorry – one of the most stupid remarks that I have ever heard during my parliamentary career, you have just stated, Mr President, that this could not be done because you were not of the same political persuasion as me. It is true, I am non-attached as a matter of principle, whereas you were only non-attached because you were betrayed by your friends.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, at least there was one way, Mr President, of solving this dispute and that was by voting. A vote is the usual procedure in a democracy. But no, now the non-attached Members’ representatives will be chosen by the President of Parliament. This is yet another farce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was indeed Mr Martin who concocted the idea and planned this, together with the representatives of the two main groups. Moreover, it reminds me of the previous amendments to the Rules of Procedure that Mr Corbett was behind, though he has now faded into obscurity and was fortunately defeated in the European Parliament elections by my friend, Nick Griffin.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Amendment 86 in the Martin report stipulates that the representative of the non-attached Members at the Conference of Presidents be decided not by the non-attached Members themselves but by the President of Parliament. The reason given is a lack of consensus among the non-attached Members. I ask myself what the problem is. Likewise, there is no consensus in this House itself when the President of Parliament is elected, which is precisely why we hold a democratic election. The representative of the non-attached Members must be representative and therefore, the best thing is to organise an election.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Parliament is starting to show itself up somewhat as a kind of Mickey Mouse parliament where the President of the House himself decides who is representative of some of his opponents. I also wonder about the basis for this decision. Is it based on representativeness? Is it based on a personal liking for or friendship with a particular non-attached Member? What criteria will the President be using to decide on the representative of the non-attached Members? I should have liked the President to make a statement on this before the vote but, unfortunately, we were not entitled to hear one.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I cannot understand how the Presidents can issue a disputed vote, and therefore the disputed outcome of a vote, and I sympathise with all of my fellow Members who have doubts as to whether their votes were correctly counted. From this perspective, I believe that the European Union and the European Parliament should act transparently and clearly, and as long as some Members feel that their votes have been treated by the voting equipment differently to the way they voted, and they did not have the possibility to check it on their monitors, then the vote will continue to be controversial.</p>
      <p sl="sk">From this perspective, I believe that it is in the interests of Mr Tőkés, and in the interests of the credibility of the European Parliament, to actually return to this vote and to vote again, so that there can be no doubt in the future concerning the election of the Vice-President of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">As the tumour spreads, rather than contemplating amputation, our leaders have decided on a lengthy course of chemotherapy which will be expensive and painful and of uncertain outcome. What I mean by that is that they will try to create the machinery of what Mr Van Rompuy calls economic governance and what his predecessor called fiscal federalism: tax harmonisation, a levy on financial transactions, a European debt agency or a European monetary fund. All these machines to try and transfer money so as to keep their project around when, of course, much the easier thing would be to excuse the taxpayers the burden of this bail-out and to give the stricken economies the massive stimulus of allowing themselves to devalue and price themselves into the market.

Whilst it is true that the assistance is working, much still remains to be done, not least given that the current international crisis will force many Member States to reduce their own aid budgets to these countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For reasons of political solidarity with my friends in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague, Barbara Matera (PPE, IT), on the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of approximately EUR 6.6 million in aid to Spain, which is facing redundancies in the non-metallic mineral products sector. Without fundamentally questioning the European Commission’s analysis based on the data provided by the Kingdom of Spain, I find it strange that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be mobilised for what is simply a consequence of the bursting of the property bubble in Spain. It is, in fact, the reduction in mortgages which accounts for the fall in the number of building permits issued and, hence, the consumption of tiles and ceramics and non-metallic mineral products. Where are we going with this type of reasoning? Can we seriously contend that this is an adjustment to globalisation? I also find that administrative costs of over EUR 400 000 are disproportionate, even if a EUR 60 000 study, the cost of which seems prohibitive, appears to be the root cause of the large amount.

I am therefore voting in favour of this resolution. I would like to repeat the Commission’s recommendation that funds should not be transferred from the European Social Fund in order to provide payments under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). These are funds with different and complementary objectives, beyond which one cannot replace the other.

Therefore, I agreed with this report and the Commission’s proposal to mobilise an amount of EUR 6 598 735, because only measures that help redundant people to integrate into the labour market are financed with money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and money from the fund creates the conditions for redundant workers to find permanent or temporary jobs, to participate in vocational training programmes and acquire the knowledge necessary to match the needs of the labour market, to acquire a business licence or become self-employed.

      <p sl="pt">The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that. This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocation due to globalisation. An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers’ rights. The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment. In the past, the EGF has been used by other EU countries, and now it is able to extend the same help to Valencia, Spain, due to the recent situation there, where more than 2 400 workers have been made redundant from 181 companies in the ‘Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products’ sector.

      <p sl="fr">For reasons of solidarity with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and Ireland, and on the basis of the report by my excellent Italian colleague, Barbara Matera, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of approximately EUR 2.7 million in aid to Ireland, which is facing redundancies in the crystal sector. Most of the 600 redundancies affect the company Waterford Crystal. Without questioning the European Commission’s analysis, I find it strange that this company, which has been in trouble since 2005, can be the root cause of an adjustment to globalisation. In 2005, it announced the closure of its Dungarvan factory, in order to consolidate all operations in the main factory in the town of Waterford in Kilkenny, which employed 1 000 people. The move involved the disappearance of nearly 500 workers from Dungarvan. Following the closure of this factory on 30 January 2009, the former employees and their families organised demonstrations, which ended in March 2009, following an agreement with the workers and payment of EUR 10 million (source: Wikipedia). Is this an adjustment to globalisation?</p>

      <p sl="ga">I sincerely welcome the compensation from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund which is being distributed to former workers from Waterford Crystal and ancillary companies. The fund was established to help workers that are suffering due to structural changes in the global trade network and it will be very important to the local community which had the Waterford Crystal industry at its heart.</p>
      <p sl="ga">As this industry was central to the region, as there were many skilled local workers employed by the glass sector and by the ancillary companies, and as the sector was vitally important to the identity of the Waterford region, this funding will be of great help to the workers and their families and will help provide other employment opportunities to the workers.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Coordination measures must be put in place at the local level to ensure that this funding is distributed correctly. As this workforce is older than other workers, and as they were doing highly-skilled work, it must be ensured that the funding is used to provide further training and education, to encourage entrepreneurship and to improve access to employment.</p>

In fact, the Kingdom of Spain justifies its request on the basis of the principle that the economic and financial crisis caused a sudden collapse in the global economy, which had a serious knock-on effect on numerous sectors, especially on demand in the construction sector and, hence, on timber products. The truth is that the crisis caused the Spanish property bubble to burst and it is hard to see what justification there is for an adjustment to globalisation … If you look at what is being financed (for example, 57 promotions of entrepreneurship costing EUR 3 000 each, giving a total of EUR 171 000, 16 training workshops combined with work placements costing EUR 12 500 each, giving a total of EUR 200 000 and so forth), where is the adjustment to globalisation?

      <p sl="it">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is intended to provide swift assistance to those workers who have fallen victim to structural changes in international trade patterns.</p>
      <p sl="it">On 24 April 2010, the Commission adopted a new proposal for mobilisation of the EGF. The latter concerns the release of EUR 1 110 000 from the fund, a sum that would cover the EGF’s primary activities, which are monitoring and implementation studies, the creation of a knowledge base, the exchange of information and experience among Member States and European experts from the EGF, the organisation of seminars, and further development of the EGF website and publications in all European languages.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, implementing the fund can only be welcomed, since it has the virtue of encouraging the Member States to make good use of the opportunities offered by the EGF, especially where workers are concerned. I believe that the creation of a knowledge base is very useful, since it acts as a binding force between the Member States and hence encourages them to cooperate with one another and to take inspiration from those countries that have greater experience in the area. Lastly, I consider it encouraging that a team of experts is leading the Member States in this process and I hope that there will be further developments in view of a future EGF project.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The recent financial earthquake has left many people unemployed or underemployed. It is good that the EU is based on the principle of solidarity. Since the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006, almost 30 applications have been made for amounts totalling EUR 154 million and assistance has been provided for 33 000 workers throughout Europe. This assistance has covered many different sectors, including the computer industry and the mobile phone and motor vehicle industry sectors.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The Baltic States were dealt a painful blow by the financial crisis. Between October 2008 and July 2009, more than 1 600 workers employed by Lithuanian construction companies lost their jobs. Half of these failed to find another job or retired and required assistance. The majority of costs are covered by the EGF, the rest are covered by Lithuania’s Employment Fund. I would like to thank the EGF for providing assistance which is selected very carefully and is socially responsible. One specific example: up to May 2009, 651 people employed by Lithuania’s AB ‘Snaigė’ (refrigeration equipment manufacturer) and two of its suppliers lost their jobs over a five month period. That had a direct impact on workers and their families, as well as on the city of Alytus, where ‘Snaigė’ is based. Given the situation that had come about, a large part of EGF money was allocated to the workers. The money granted will offer workers the opportunity to find work and to study and retrain.</p>

I would like to point out that genuine cases in which these funds are needed are generally extremely urgent, and hence the procedure of allowing access to such funds should be as efficient and rapid as possible.

      <p sl="it">According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little. If we then consider that, according to the Court of Auditors, 51% of resources earmarked to Sicily for the 2000-2006 programming period were not spent and that a good percentage of the funds utilised were blighted by irregularities, we can easily understand the almost total lack of public trust.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore fully support the report by my fellow Member. Only total transparency with the aim of ensuring that the public is made aware of the effective use of public resources can restore trust in the institutions. Anyone must be able to know to whom funds are allocated and, above all, to what end they are directed, while also being able to follow all stages from programming to the implementation of interventions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Enabling citizens to monitor European funds not only represents a fundamental manifestation of the democratic process but also constitutes a deterrent to any form of siphoning off of those public resources.

Information must be accessible and easily intelligible; otherwise, its production will be merely a technical exercise that does not serve the purpose of any democratic control.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report, which advocates a concerted and accessible approach towards the interregional exchange of best practice, with the aim of enabling those involved in cohesion policy to draw on the experience of others. I believe that the predominance of issues relating to project management by those involved in implementing cohesion policy is a crucial factor in improving and facilitating governance. Member States should decentralise the implementation of cohesion policy in order to ensure the proper running of multi-level governance, respecting the principles of partnership and subsidiarity. I welcome the creation of an Audit Reference Manual along with its simplification, particularly in matters relating to eligibility, financial engineering and financial reporting.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to point out the obstacles presented by potential candidates with respect to the use of the structural funds. They have greater bureaucratic burdens, too many complex regulations, a lack of transparency in decision-making processes and cofinancing rules, and delayed payments. If these obstacles are to be overcome, long-term criteria should be defined for projects that are cofinanced through the structural funds, and special measures developed along with new qualitative indicators for regions with specific geographic characteristics, such as the outermost regions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Transparency Initiative has been in force since 2005 when it was adopted by the Commission. Just one year later, the Green Paper was published with the aim of improving transparency, openness and accountability of EU governance. The reason underlying the adoption of these documents was the European citizen’s fundamental right to know who is receiving European funds. Every one of them makes a financial contribution to these projects to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Publishing information online about major projects prior to making decisions about their funding is a common practice within international financial institutions. The European Commission has been an exception to this practice until now, even though there is no good reason why the Community executive should adhere to lower standards of transparency. In these circumstances, Parliament’s request to the Commission to publish information on the Internet in good time, in order to provide direct access to the documentation about European finances, fits in perfectly with the transparency policy adopted at EU level. It is important that projects approved by the Commission are above any suspicion and that the general public is informed about them right from the very first stages of submitting funding requests.</p>

Defining the type of documentation to be provided, guaranteeing access to that documentation, above all, in the case of ‘major projects’, and creating a common model to be respected will prevent waste and a lack of procedural transparency.

      <p sl="lt">Providing public information on the recipients of EU funds is a cornerstone of the European Transparency Initiative (ETI). I believe that the requirement in the Financial Regulation for Member States to provide information on how EU funds under shared management are spent, in particular, through the ex-post publication of beneficiaries, is insufficient. The Commission limits its role to proposing a common indicative standard for the publication of data and providing EU citizens, through its DG REGIO website, with links to Member States’ electronic addresses where the requested data on European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund beneficiaries are published. With the aforementioned funds implemented under ‘shared management’, these links and their content is the sole responsibility of the Member States and is based on information provided by the managing authorities. The variability in the presentation and in the conditions of access to data does not allow a complete comparison at EU level. Therefore, I agreed with the proposals submitted by the European Parliament to make Member State databases fully searchable and compatible, so as to facilitate an EU-wide overview of the data presented and to ensure that the data collected should appear and should be managed in a structured, comparable way to ensure its full usability.

On the one hand, they will enjoy the benefits of the ETI by facilitating the maximum possible access to this database on the funds’ recipients, which could provide specific examples of good practice in regional funding.

This level of importance means it is worthwhile increasing the penalties for infringements of the communication and publicity obligations, promoting a more modern and functional network system between the management authorities, defining a common basis for standardising the conduct of individual States and creating a link between publicity, monitoring and auditing. These actions should be incorporated into the package of measures to combat the crisis.

If the EU is serious about transparency, then it must also be implemented consistently in decision making. As ever, the transparency initiative is largely empty words, which is why I abstained from voting.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Financial transparency of public institutions is a foundation of modern democracy. The citizens must have access to information about how each euro is spent – because each euro comes from taxes which they have paid. It is no secret that the European Transparency Initiative, adopted by the Commission in 2005, is having its first effects. I welcome this. On the other hand, there is still much to be done. It saddens me to note that standards on transparency used in the European Commission when implementing regional policy are lower than in other institutions, including principally those in use in the European Investment Bank. There is no reason why such a state of affairs should continue. I share the resolution’s satisfaction with progress on social control over distribution of funds for the realisation of regional policy objectives. I also have high regard for the resolution’s emphasis on the role of the institution of civil society in the programming system of cohesion policy. I am sure that the measures proposed in the resolution will contribute to an increase in the effectiveness of programmes and to the legitimisation of EU cohesion policy. In view of these factors, I decided to endorse the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Tremopoulos, which contains provisions aimed at improving efficiency and transparency in European Regional policy. If we want to provide better access to the available funds for the potential beneficiaries of the European Structural Funds, it seems to me that the administrative constraints associated with funding applications will need to be made less cumbersome and the procedures for accessing EU funding more transparent. By making the rules and application of the rules clearer and more straightforward, this EU funding will be made more efficient. I also feel it is essential for citizens to be better informed about the projects carried out by the European Union, especially those relating to the use of Structural Funds. I am therefore in favour of the publication by the European Commission of more information for the benefit of the general public about major projects carried out using these funds and whether the projects have been completed or are still under way.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I supported and voted for the Tremopoulos report calling on the European Commission and the national managing authorities to use greater transparency in the allocation and use of Structural Funds. It is important that we obtain comparable data regarding administration of the funds from across the Union, so that the project owners and citizens can be aware of what the EU’s funding priorities are, which stakeholders have already received funds, how the funds have been used and what the procedures and timescales are for the various projects. The goal in doing this is to make potential beneficiaries more aware of these funds, and to monitor their use more effectively. However, it was important not to step over into excessive transparency and overload the fund managing authorities and project owners with information requirements that are irrelevant, ineffective and counterproductive. This is why my colleagues and I from the Presidential majority of the Committee on Regional Development amended the original text to make sure that the objective of transparency was not achieved at the expense of the cohesion policy’s objective of simplification, because it is precisely these two major issues of simplicity and visibility that cohesion policy needs to address.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress that transparency is very important for a country like mine, Lithuania. EU funds like the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund have helped shape Lithuania’s economic, social and environmental development and will continue to shape it for some time to come. Therefore, it is important for citizens to be given the opportunity to become witnesses and have an influence in allocating these resources. For that to happen, it is necessary for society to participate. The participation of society might occur in various ways in the decision-making process – allocating EU funds and implementing them. Greater participation by society would reduce the level of corruption and increase the effective use of funds, which is particularly important for a country like Lithuania. It is also important for the recipients of EU funds to be made public. That would encourage discussions on the use of public money in the country, which again is one of the fundamental principles of a functioning democratic state. I would also like to underline the need for regional and local institutions and, above all, ordinary citizens, to participate. The report contains a few observations on a comprehensive Internet platform that would help to review and give a better grasp of existing funds. That is a good start, but more should be done to include people from different layers of society – rich and poor, those from large cities and small villages. Civil society and non-governmental organisations could also help to promote the effectiveness of programmes and improve their accountability.</p>

It is important that the European Parliament fights for greater transparency in regional policy, but we reject the so-called ‘naming and shaming’, as asked for in point 16 of this report. We certainly agree to a tougher line on communication and information requirements, but the goal of more transparency – which we also support – should not be achieved by the wrong means. We are afraid of having a ‘witch-hunt’ when naming and shaming is carried out. The European Commission should not be made a moral authority which achieves group discipline by naming, shaming or blaming.

Owing to the fact that, on legal basis grounds, the Court of Justice of the European Union recently annulled Regulation (EC) No 1968/2006, which rightly allowed these financial contributions, the Members of the European Parliament had to adopt a new regulation based on the appropriate legal basis.

      <p sl="ro">The freight sector at EU level has a huge amount of potential to offer at a time when it is enjoying steady growth. In these circumstances, it seems paradoxical that increasingly fewer companies are opting for rail transport. Just 10% of the freight transported across the European Union is carried by rail. In actual fact, the level of rail freight traffic has halved compared to 20 years ago. The European Commission has acknowledged the key role played by rail freight transport since 2001.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The deadline for the White Paper on European policies in the transport sector was then set for 2010. The rail freight market must now tackle the challenges posed in improving the quality of the services provided due to the lack of compliance, which is a handicap when competing with other forms of freight transport. It becomes impossible to explain the decline in the rail freight sector when there are three rail legislative packages. They are not sufficiently harmonised with national legislation and the rail systems are not connected at cross-border level.

The creation of a one-stop shop for each corridor will also allow companies to deal with a single contact. This symbolises rail corridor management placed in a European perspective. This regulation is therefore a strong signal in favour of a real European transport and infrastructure policy.

Without questioning the importance of rail transport of goods and the need for European coordination of this transport, and supporting the creation of so-called freight corridors, the fact is that, in the current economic and financial climate in EU countries, creating an integrated freight transport system necessarily presupposes very high investment from the Member States, and we cannot guarantee that they are in a position to promise or supply such investment.

      <p sl="de">I have just voted against the amendment in the Marinescu report which aims to establish a central coordination body that will act as a one-stop shop for managing freight traffic. Another 162 of my fellow Members have voted in the same way, following a petition which I helped to launch. We are in favour of quality and competitiveness in the field of rail freight. We want to see flexible and efficient solutions and we also believe in promoting rail transport for environmental reasons. However, local and long-distance passenger transport must not be affected in any way. The highly complex text of the report does not include a clear statement of this kind. Unfortunately, the European Parliament voted in favour of the recommendation by the Commission and the majority of the Council to have the allocation of train paths managed by an additional central coordinating body in future. This will result in a fragmentation of authority, which will have a serious impact on timetabling. In Germany, which is a traditional transit country, the rail network is already operating almost at full capacity. All of the three planned corridors pass through important population centres. In the Federal State of Hesse, these are the towns of Fulda and Frankfurt, which are on the path from Stockholm to Palermo. The European Parliament’s good reputation as the main body providing protection for consumers in Europe has been damaged today. The Member States will lose the authority to make decisions about their own rail networks and all the citizens of Europe will be affected by the resulting train delays.</p>

In view of this, the creation of rail corridors which allow rapid and efficient links between one national network and another will allow for improvements in the conditions for using the infrastructure. It is vital that we approve the present regulation in order to make rail freight transport more competitive compared with what is currently in use.

In my opinion, all this will have a negative impact on rail operations throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the EU really wants to encourage more freight onto the rail network, then it should set priorities in the realisation of the trans-European transport networks. Complete expansion of the southern corridor by means of the so-called Koralm Tunnel, for example, would bring about an unprecedented shift onto the rail network. We should be promoting rail freight, not more centralisation.</p>

My support for this agreement is also strengthened by the importance of the rail network in Lithuania and the economic perspective it offers my country. It is of paramount importance – not only to Lithuania but also to the European Union as a whole – to stop the decline of rail market share in freight transport.

      <p sl="pt">Despite freight having been in decline for many years, of the various alternatives to road transport, it is still the one that offers the greatest level of safety and efficiency. This report aims to try to increase the market share of rail freight by creating corridors between at least two Member States so that the goods can be transported quickly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Having read the report, it is my understanding that the creation of these corridors will not establish a priority route for goods to the detriment of passenger transport, as I gather that there is no difference in treatment between the two types of rail traffic. The one-stop shop will be strategically important for coordination, as the management of requested routes will be realised through it. In the Council’s vision, it has been reduced to an information booth, but I take the same view as the rapporteur, who believes that it is crucial for the desired flow of goods.</p>

However, in the course of these amendments, the two large groups – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – are attempting to curtail the rights of Members who do not belong to one of the large groups. This is particularly wrong and unfair, since it would be lost in the mire of the debate on the major adaptations to the Treaty of Lisbon. For example, it is proposed that non-attached Members could no longer decide themselves who is to represent them, as is the case at present. This is a unique occurrence in democratic politics that is unacceptable. In any democratic parliament worthy of the name, a political group is allowed to decide its own representative on certain committees.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, here it is proposed that the President – who is a member of one of the two large political parties – should decide which of the non-attached Members should represent them at the Conference of Presidents. In other words, their political opponents will be able to choose a representative whose policy is nearest to their own. This is scandalous. In my opinion, the representative of the non-attached Members can only be chosen by a vote among the full assembly of non-attached Members. I therefore voted against the proposed amendment.</p>

The amendments made to the Rules of Procedure also take account of the rules on the budget, insofar as Parliament will take decisions on this matter in cooperation with the Council.

      <p sl="fr">The European Commission’s draft budget for 2011 is not up to the challenges confronting Europe. When we have EUR 142 billion of commitments – that is, 1.15% of Europe’s GNI – the Commission proposes to finance new priorities, as well as programmes already included in the financial framework for 2007-2013, by taking from the funds of existing programmes and from a budget margin that has been reduced to virtually nothing. The 2020 agenda for growth and employment, which is supposed to be the Union’s road map for the next ten years, and the fight against climate change cannot truly take place without financial resources. It is not acceptable to finance the upcoming instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries by taking money from development aid. It is not realistic to reduce European financial aid for the Middle East peace process by a third. This is not a serious approach. We were expecting more boldness from the Commission. Yet the European Parliament is still waiting for a draft mid-term review of the financial perspectives, something that there is a great need for in Europe.

This would create more jobs with rights, combat poverty and reduce regional inequality in order to promote economic and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, it is also essential to increase rates of EU cofinancing for countries with weaker economies, particularly for social programmes and productive investment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report on the mandate for the trialogue on the 2011 draft budget, which was adopted today at the plenary sitting of the European Parliament, mentions six priorities for the budget negotiations for 2011. One of these are the programmes for young people, such as Youth on the Move, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action and Erasmus Mundus. In item 12 of the general remarks, the report points out that the increase in appropriations in the draft budget for those programmes, despite the very high current implementation rate (reaching between 95-100% every year over the period 2007-2009), is insufficient. I welcome the fact that the text which has been accepted calls for these appropriations to be increased, so that it will be possible to put the youth programmes into effect in a way which is appropriate to their significance for civil society in Europe.</p>

The budget for 2011 is heavily influenced by the crisis and the recession and this is clear, among other things, from the very tight margins. However, there are also positive signs. One of these is the priority given to youth programmes. If the European Union wants to find a sustainable route out of the crisis, it is essential for it to invest in young people, because they represent our future.

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this report because I feel that we have to increase transparency in the derivatives market (trade in future transactions) and ensure greater regulation of this market. Derivative instruments can play a useful role in allowing the transfer of financial risks within an economy, but as a result of the lack of transparency and regulation, they played an exacerbating role in the financial crisis. I welcome the Commission’s initiative for better regulation of derivatives and, in particular, over-the-counter derivatives, with a view to reducing the impact of the risks for the stability of financial markets as a whole, and for standardisation of derivatives contracts, the use of centralised data storage and organised trading venues.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr Langen’s report proposes a set of measures that aim to make the derivative financial product market more transparent. In view of the way the financial crisis of 2008 came about and the fragility that such complex products have imposed on the markets, it is undoubtedly a promising step to introduce greater stability and transparency. I therefore voted in favour of the Langen report.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should nevertheless stress another point, which is a basic principle in any discussion of finance, the economic crisis and the market. Quite apart from any derivatives and intricate financial engineering, the 2008 crisis, which determined negative knock-on effects that still weigh heavily on our society, came about due to the fact that we mistakenly believed for all too long that we did not have to consider the real economy. I therefore welcome any current measure to promote the transparency of financial markets and products offered by banks and share markets, but we must all remember that we urgently need to rethink the economic system on which the world markets rest. Our choice must therefore be aimed at strengthening the real economy, the only certain source of wealth and lasting stability.</p>

      <p sl="it">I should like first of all to congratulate my friend and colleague, Mr Langen, on the draft report put to the vote today in this House.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the light of the financial and economic crisis, we have observed the dangers posed by certain financial instruments that are shamelessly used by the markets without any rules or restrictions. Many citizens and numerous local authorities, including in Italy, have fallen victim to these high risk instruments, and are now finding themselves with alarming budget deficits.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to prevent such unfortunate situations, I believe it is appropriate, indeed necessary, to regulate derivatives properly, so as to have a more stable and secure market that enables operators and consumers to take informed decisions. The European Union must become the champion of a radical change from the financial policy of the past and must send out strong signals to prevent instruments such as over-the-counter derivatives from being able to jeopardise the entire financial market in future.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I support the guidelines set out by Mr Langen in the text adopted today, not least because financial derivatives are not just the prerogative of professionals in the sector, but are instruments for mass-market use. For this reason, stricter legislation will guarantee greater transparency, enabling ‘market participants to price risks properly’.</p>

One of the basic causes of economic and financial instability is the development and increase in non-banking transactions, which include risk premiums and other financial derivatives.</p>
      <p sl="el">The recent collapse of the money markets and speculation against Greek bonds showed not only that the financial system needs strict regulation, but also that certain transactions, such as risk premium transactions, should be banned.

      <p sl="pt">The derivatives market, as has been proven with the economic, financial and social crisis that we are currently experiencing, needs efficient regulation which allows for greater transparency in the marketing of these financial instruments.

      <p sl="pt">I welcome the deployment of the European institutions to ensure the greatest possible efficiency, security and soundness in derivatives markets, in recognition of its importance for the sustainability of economic development, along with the need to ensure the regulation and verification of procedures and negotiations related to the transaction or commercialisation of these financial instruments. Given the size of the derivatives market and its impact on the global economy, as has become evident in the current economic and financial crisis – and the exponential rise of the risk component in the global market – I believe that ensuring transparency is crucial. This is vital not only for effective supervision of the markets, but also for clear, concise and complete reporting standards. The ‘credit default swaps’ from sovereign issuers used by financial speculators have led to unjustified levels of diverse national ‘spreads’. This highlights the need for transparency in the market and enhanced European regulations concerning the negotiation of ‘credit default swaps’, particularly those related to sovereign debt. It is to be hoped that future legislation will bring not only transparency to the derivatives markets but also sound legislation. I would like to stress that the cost of future market infrastructures should be borne by those involved in the market, not by taxpayers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Instead of proposing the end of the derivatives market, the majority in Parliament have restricted themselves to defending the ban on speculative trading of credit default swaps (CDS) of sovereign debt. They urge the Commission to consider maximum risk limits for derivatives, particularly CDS, and to establish an agreement on them with its international partners. However, from what has been stated, the Commission can only present its proposal on derivates markets in September, and Parliament will legislate upon it on an equal footing with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pt">All this waiting is unfortunate when you watch the dramatic rises in interest rates that are implicit in the obligations of sovereign issuers in some euro area countries to unsustainable levels, knowing the negative effect that CDS have had on the whole process. We cannot continue to allow speculative securities based on sovereign debt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is true that Parliament has advocated a ban on CDS – which are purely speculative transactions involving bets on the debtor’s breach – today, but then it limited itself to requesting longer terms of imprisonment in the case of short sales of securities and derivatives. As far as we are concerned, therefore, we gave our support to the positive proposals, but we are against the backward position and the huge delay in regulating capital markets.</p>

By standardising transactions and ensuring that the clearing houses are independent, very significant progress will be made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the regulatory mechanisms that will be introduced very shortly thanks to the collaboration between the Commission, the Council and Parliament should not completely rein in the derivatives markets, which fulfil an important role in world finance. It is important to distinguish, as the rapporteur indeed does, between derivatives instruments that are used to cover risks directly associated with the companies’ business and those that are used solely for speculative purposes. It is only the latter that are liable to pose a systemic risk and that should be suitably overseen in order to avoid a repeat of the kind of crises we have recently experienced.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the past, derivative instruments played an important role by transferring risk in the economy. However, the lack of transparency and regulation in the derivatives markets had an extremely pernicious effect on the financial crisis. One of the instruments that most affected European economies and led to increased interest on sovereign debt was CDS (credit default swaps). This regulation upholds a ban on speculative trading using this instrument, as it can lead to distortion in the sovereign debt markets. It is of paramount importance to distinguish between derivatives products used as a tool for managing risk to cover a real underlying risk to the subject, and derivatives solely used for speculative purposes. That is why I voted as I did.</p>

      <p sl="en">The key aspects of Mr Langen’s report are acceptable. However, during the discussion in committee, there was much made of the dangers of the industry. Clearly, the size of derivative activity raises questions about how to regulate the industry, so transparency and a harmonised supervisory approach are regarded as very important factors. At the same time, it is unnecessary to raise the costs of trading by insisting on concentrating the clearing of such trades through single bourses. Fortunately, Mr Langen is well aware of the limits of such an approach which could place costs at up to ten times higher in a bourse than elsewhere. We also need to ensure that the so-called tailor-made derivative instruments allowing companies to hedge against future rises in commodity markets are maintained. We should also ensure international compatibility – especially with the USA, the largest market.</p>

We are talking about devices and technologies capable of transmitting an object’s position, features and identity. Along with the right to silence, these mechanisms must only be integrated at the individual’s request and not as a standard production feature. At the same time, the Commission must take into account, when a decision is being made on implementing projects pertaining to the Internet of Things, which network is going to be selected for connecting these objects. At present, we are facing numerous cyber attacks on the Internet. As far as I see it, using the World Wide Web to connect to the Internet of Things may pose a security risk and place a considerable burden on the current network. The development of a parallel network for connecting objects may provide the solution in the current situation through sharing the digital spectrum and dividend.</p>

The exponential increase in content on the Internet has made it a tool with many uses, and these uses are multiplying.

      <p sl="pt">The impact of new technology on the public’s security and quality of life is indisputable, and this highlights both the benefits and the risks that it entails. In this context, the ‘Internet of Things’ involves a new set of advantages for people, without impeding the identification of possible risks inherent in a tool with great potential. I would like to emphasise the approach of stimulating research and launching pilot projects, along with making the most of opportunities that are arising, particularly in optimising energy saving, production processes, creating new jobs and challenges. However, it is vital that the EU has a common frame of reference to reinforce the provisions relating to overseeing the system, confidentiality, information security, ethical management, privacy, collection and storage of personal data and consumer information. The rapid evolution of the ‘Internet of Things’ calls for governance of it that is safe, transparent and multilateral. Given this, I share the Commission’s concerns with regard to safety, personal data protection and privacy for members of the public, along with the governance of the ‘Internet of Things’ for the sake of respecting privacy and personal data protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Internet of Things is a project that was started in 1999 in the US. It is increasingly growing in popularity, and it is expected that over the next 10 to 15 years, it will revolutionise person-object and object-object interaction through the growing use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The process of developing the Internet of Things, with all the innovation and positive aspects that it can bring to our everyday lives, also has a great margin of uncertainty, both at a conceptual and technical level, which merits some concerns. The technology behind this step, RFID, is called a tag: an electric component made of a chip and an antenna. The chip, only a few millimetres wide, can contain, receive and transmit information without any cable connection. This raises several issues about ownership, management and privacy, among others.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the issue of privacy and data protection, the rapporteur points out the ‘importance of ensuring that all fundamental rights – not only privacy – are protected in the process of developing the Internet of Things, which we think is a positive view. However, we have serious doubts about the management of this data. The way ahead is still unclear, and so we have abstained from voting.</p>

Soon, the latest technology will allow not just computers to be connected to the net, but also cars, or even books, food and other items. Once a car has been connected to the net, it would be possible to give the driver information on tyre pressure. Programmed refrigerators will be able to recognise products past their expiry date. I voted for this report because the Internet of Things will revive the economy shackled by the crisis and will help to create new jobs and new services for an increasing number of EU citizens and companies.

      <p sl="en">We Greens have strongly supported this report by our socialist colleague, Badia i Cutchet. It will be an important new application of Internet technology. In the next 10-15 years, it is predicted that the Internet of Things will enter our daily lives. It uses RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to receive and transmit information wirelessly. It works with a tiny chip which has the capacity to store a lot of information about the object or the person on which it has been placed. In the agri-food sector, for example, RFID allows better and faster product traceability, and provides information about content: chemical characteristics, gluten levels, etc. Similar applications are already in use, such as a chip that can convey real-time information about tyre pressure to a driver. This new technology will revolutionise and widen person-to-thing and thing-to-thing interaction. The innovation lies in the thing-to-thing relationship. The most commonly cited practical example of this is that of fridges which, if suitably programmed, will be able to detect any product past, or approaching, its use-by date.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Although I voted in favour of this resolution, I noticed the qualifications made about certain regions, particularly the outermost regions, in terms of access to innovation. Difficulties related to a lack of critical mass must be taken into account in order to encourage better use of the potential for areas such as research and innovation in these regions. The unique characteristics of the ORs in terms of geography and climate are particular advantages in terms of the development of specific activities in the areas of biodiversity, marine resources, climate change, renewable energy, water, the environment, natural resources, health and new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In terms of natural resources and biodiversity, in particular, the ORs allow European research privileged access to tropical ecosystems endowed with a unique biodiversity and agriculture. This enables research to be carried out within the context of the European Research Area as ‘natural laboratories’. They are also good places for experimentation. Despite the possibilities of many regions and all the effort put into them, many continue to have more difficulties than other regions in improving factors that contribute to competitiveness, growth and employment, as per the Lisbon Strategy, especially within the context of research and development.</p>

Innovation is the key factor in successfully responding to the major societal and environmental challenges currently faced by the Union and in achieving its strategic political objectives. We will not achieve our energy and climate objectives by 2020 without speeding up the development and the general application of proper, durable and efficient energy technologies. I support the strengthening of dialogue between universities and businesses.

      <p sl="lt">I supported this report. Scientific research and innovation are the key to successfully meeting the EU’s current grand societal and environmental challenges and realising its strategic political goals in areas including competitiveness, climate change, employment, demographic change and many others. In order to remain competitive, the EU must invest in sustainable technologies, ensuring that they receive the required funding. Until now, Europe has lagged far behind in the area of scientific research and innovations, because this area is very fragmented and there are differences between scientific research and innovations and market replication. I feel that the European Commission’s future plan for innovations must resolve the issues of private sector financing of scientific research and innovations, which would allow companies to create innovative products and services and adapt them in the market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Whether they concern products or processes and are radical or incremental, nowadays, innovations are the driving force behind the competitiveness of up-to-date economic and business systems that strive for efficiency and sustainability. The research that underpins each innovative action and discovery must therefore be supported, particularly when it succeeds in bringing together small and medium-sized enterprises and the world of new technology.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, I can only support the own initiative report drafted by Mr Winkler, which introduces a third agent to close the knowledge triangle, in other words, consumers. We need reference points within the constant situation of flux we experience in our lives nowadays. Therefore, it is important that growth and the competitiveness of the economic and social system always remain on a human scale.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At the moment, less than 1% of the European Union’s budget goes on innovation. This is the current state of affairs at a time when Europe has realised that its future lies within the knowledge triangle of research-innovation-education. The European Parliament’s request to increase the resources allocated to innovation is absolutely justified in these circumstances. We are approaching the time for looking at the financial projections for the 2014-2020 period and must take this request into consideration. Transforming Europe’s economy into a sustainable economy must make European companies more competitive and allow new opportunities to emerge for national economies as a result of the economic and ecological challenges facing Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Moreover, and especially against the backdrop of the financial crisis and the credit crunch, it is crucially important for companies’ innovative capacity that more funding should be made available at both EU and national level and that appropriate financial instruments should be created. Splitting resources across a host of objectives and a series of specific EU initiatives has not produced satisfactory results so far. Funding must be directed at those areas where the boomerang effect is greatest. The key criterion here must be added value for Europe.</p>

However, so far, only 1% of the EU’s budget has been earmarked for this sector, a percentage that is not enough to address the difficult challenges that Europe is having to face. It is time for the European Union to invest more in the field of research and innovation. I do believe that we can overcome the economic crisis and making more funds available is one way of doing this.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also believe it is important to provide incentives for and encourage private investment in technological innovation, because only by carrying out research will we be able to have a competitive market that can withstand the increasing number of relocations.

      <p sl="it">Intelligent growth based on the knowledge and innovation economy requires concrete measures on the part of supranational and national institutions.</p>

At the same time as asking countries to invest more heavily in research, we should offer them a European regulatory framework that is both general and specific, with common, coordinated development guidelines and instruments for monitoring whether the funding is producing the desired results.</p>
      <p sl="it">I propose and support regulation at European level of apprenticeship, training and vocational measures, which some countries have already incorporated into their educational systems, as well as the ‘rights and duties’ measures in the field of education. If, however, we are to aim for 3% of GDP to be allocated to research funding, we need the world of academia to provide more guarantees as regards, for instance, the academic productivity of lecturers, and we must prevent the piecemeal apportionment of resources, which has given rise in recent years to the improper and disproportionate use of already limited funds, with unsatisfactory results.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Innovation has an especially important place in modern society. A society based on innovation can avert possible crises, both socio-economic and natural. Consequently, it is vital for an innovation policy to be able to facilitate society’s progress and not make it stagnate due to the use of various bureaucratic ploys. As Mr Winkler specifies in his report, innovation nowadays must also take into account the social value it brings. I believe that the innovations of the 21st century must also consider the impact they have on the individual and society in general. Innovations such as the ‘Internet of Things’, for example, must take into account and respect the right to privacy and protection for the individual’s personal data. European society must not become a ‘Big Brother’ society. On the contrary, the innovations made must help people communicate freely in an open society. The contribution made by technological and social innovations actually underlies our progress. This is the reason why I am asking the Commission to deal with this matter with maximum accountability and present a vision for drafting an innovation action plan for the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The risk of unanimity around this concept is, however, that it will become deflated, as has happened with other fads such as the environment, economic sustainability or supporting entrepreneurship. These topics cover pages of election manifestos and programmes and almost always end up losing any distinguishing feature that they might have had, being mere statements of fact. In this regard, despite serious efforts by the government on certain aspects, I must draw attention to the negative technological populism from which the Prime Minister of Portugal seems to suffer. It would be better to concentrate more on content and less on proclamations to do with improvements in working conditions and scientific production, and to remember that while competitive effort calls for ambition, it also requires a realistic approach.</p>

In view of this, I support this report for the revision of EU innovation policy, stressing the urgent need for the EU to concentrate its efforts on leveraging resources in this area. I would also like to point out the importance of incentives for the private sector and a comprehensive, cross-cutting strategy for achieving European innovation policy as a priority.</p>

      <p sl="pt">However, the priority which is given to each of the areas included in the so-called Europe 2020 strategy, such as business activity, employment, demographic change and an inclusive society, is such that the document and the analysis of necessary innovation in a changing world falls far short of what is needed to promote real economic and social cohesion, growth in productivity, job creation and wage recovery in the Member States, all of which we believe to be crucial. That is why we abstained.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report on the challenges facing European Union innovation policy is a very good document which has raised the most important questions related to this issue. Together with my colleagues from the S&amp;D Group, I endorsed the report, including Amendment 46, which calls on the Commission and Member States to coordinate their efforts to reach agreement on a Community patent and a single patent court system. This matter has been dragging on for many years, and for many years the same arguments have been repeated in favour of a common patent, along with the same contentious questions (for example, how many languages should European patents be translated into?). Some legal questions have been clarified since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force. We are going to have two regulations: one about the patent itself, and the other about the language system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On top of this, however, there is the matter of the patent court system, the establishment of which will require regulation of the relationship between the European Union and the European Patent Organisation in a way which is in accordance with the competences of EU institutions, including the European Parliament. Without going into details on the patent system, which will, no doubt, be the subject of numerous discussions, I would like to stress that this issue is one of the most important challenges of the current term of the European Parliament. Therefore, I think that at each step, we should call on the other institutions to start constructive cooperation in this area, which is just what Mr Winkler’s report does.</p>

      <p sl="lt">As a result of global competition to attract investment, not only certain production plants but also the research and development capacities associated with them are increasingly being relocated to third countries. This trend is a fundamental threat to Europe as a location for industry. It needs to be countered, through the determined promotion of innovative potential, before it becomes irreversible. According to the Commission, less than 1% of the EU budget is currently spent directly on innovation-related measures. Given the social challenges that lie ahead, this is insufficient. Therefore, I agree with calls for an increase in the EU budget for innovation. This should be reflected in the planning process in connection with the 2014-2020 financial perspective. Moreover, and especially against the backdrop of the financial crisis and the credit crunch, it is crucially important for companies’ innovative capacity that more funding should be made available at both EU level and national level, and that financial instruments should be created which are tailored to the needs of their users. In order to make innovation policy more effective, the various support instruments need to be better coordinated and properly linked, with a leaner management structure; in other words, financial support must be better targeted.</p>

I would like to point out that apart from the cross-sectoral nature of innovation policy, the initiative of citizens is also important.</p>

Combating the increase in relocations to third countries, not only of production facilities but also of their associated research and development capabilities, must become one of our objectives.</p>

Furthermore, the dialogue between the research sector and the economic sector must be strengthened. In this respect, I welcome the creation of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, which will help boost relations between these two worlds.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report because I believe that eradicating poverty is a matter of the greatest importance. The elimination of poverty is the main objective set by the Treaty of Lisbon for EU cooperation and development policies, and given that this is a moral duty whose long-term usefulness for EU interests is vital, I believe that prioritising this objective within our foreign policy is crucial. It is also worth noting that despite the profound economic crisis which Europe and the rest of the world are experiencing, we cannot and should not neglect foreign aid, as this is essential for creating a world of greater justice and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given that the objectives outlined at the Millennium Summit in 2000, where we committed ourselves to improving our contribution to fighting poverty, are still a long way from being achieved, and that the year 2015 – the target year for achieving those goals – is drawing ever closer, we should examine different factors which are aimed at maximising the results of the MDGs as a matter of the utmost urgency. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for this document and take this opportunity to voice my support for this project.</p>

This is about reducing extreme poverty and hunger, ensuring primary education for all, promoting sexual equality, reducing infant mortality, improving maternal hygiene, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, conserving the environment in a sustainable manner and introducing a global partnership for development. In September 2010, all the Member States of the United Nations met to determine the procedure and to improve the results.

We must also strive to facilitate the integration of developing countries into the global economy and stimulate the development of trade in these countries.

Everything seems to indicate that these objectives will not be achieved. The EU has an immense responsibility in that it is the primary source of aid to poor countries and, in this respect, it is listened to on the international stage when it comes to questions of development. The Cashman report makes a very fair assessment of the state of the Millennium Development Goals, with the emphasis being on extreme poverty, the situation of women, health, education and the environment. This report reminds us that the European Union has to make sure that there is consistency in development policies. A country’s agricultural, fishing and business activities must not run counter to its development. Throughout this report, Parliament shows itself to be proactive by supporting new forms of financing which need to be introduced more generally. The report drafted during the Millennium Summit in 2000 is more relevant than ever. It is the duty of our leaders to bring these realistic and achievable objectives to fruition as quickly as possible. Above all, this is a question of will.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this report because achieving the Millennium Development Goals must remain a key objective for the European Union. Achieving the MDGs, against all the odds, is a very important challenge and an urgent one both at EU and international level. The EU and international community should focus their efforts and take concrete action to enhance the chances of MDG success. I would like to underline that now is not the time for savings on the backs of the sick and starving. Therefore, we must devote particular attention to such areas as health, women and children and the fight against poverty and devote greater attention to employment and decent work. I would like to point out that poverty reduction through the achievement of the MDGs must be recognised as the overall goal of EU policy and Europe must lead the world in a concerted effort to keep the EU’s promises to the planet’s poorest. I agree with the European Parliament’s call for a majority of EU financial aid to be granted to the neediest people, focusing especially on women, children and people with disabilities and all those who need that aid most.

      <p sl="pt">Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a priority in development policy. Only a few months from the high-level UN meeting, despite significant progress having been made on some of the MDGs, the truth is that we are a long way from what we had hoped. More needs to be done. The Member States should respect the commitment that they made to Official Development Assistance (ODA). New financing mechanisms which do not translate into higher taxes at this time of crisis need to be explored. Above all, it is crucial to bring about consistency in development policies (along the route of the resolution approved in May this year on consistency in EU development policies and the concept of greater public development aid).</p>

The EU is 20 billion euro short of its funding commitments, at a time when states are cutting back their aid budgets. The EU Member States must not falter when it comes to fulfilling their commitments in the framework of the European Consensus on Development. Moreover, the MDGs have to be seen from a development-enabling perspective, while at the same time facing and tackling the root causes of poverty. Member States must commit 0.7% of GNI to aid by 2015, as promised, rather than decrease that share, which is doubly alarming in times of crisis, as GNI itself diminishes. Besides, it is not acceptable for the EU to broaden the definition of Official Development Aid to include other financial flows such as remittances or debt cancellation measures. To address underdevelopment, the developed world needs to vigorously fight tax havens and illicit capital flows which deprive developing countries of resources they desperately need. I believe that responsibility for development has to remain within the remit of the Development Commissioner, who needs to push for better policy coherence, especially as regards trade, common agriculture and fisheries policies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Parliament is sending a strong message by adopting a resolution on the progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. This shows the importance that Europe attaches to eliminating poverty, hunger, disease and infant and maternal mortality between now and 2015. On the eve of the European Council, the message is clear. The Heads of State or Government of the EU must stick to their financial commitments, including – perhaps even more than ever – in this period of global economic and financial crisis. What is needed is a contribution of 0.7% of the GNP of the Member States. In order to catch up with respect to its financial commitments, Europe must create new mechanisms of financing, such as a tax of 0.05% on financial transactions. Given how much these transactions currently amount to – recently, this was 70 times the global GNP – such a tax could free up EUR 10 billion per year. In addition, it would have the advantage of making the financial sector contribute. This would seem fair, given that this sector has benefited from enormous amounts of State aid in order to survive the unprecedented crisis that it itself caused. A unilateral EU initiative could act as a catalyst at a global level.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is a fundamental commitment by the international community. However, it has not provided itself with the resources to fulfil that commitment. Two-thirds of the way through, it is clear that many least developed countries (LDCs) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty, of providing access to education and health care, and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too. Europe is the world’s leading donor but, with 0.4% of GNI, it cannot be content with falling so far short of the target of devoting 0.56% to official development assistance (ODA) in 2010, a target that it set itself. The fact is, the aid requirements are greater than ever, especially in the areas of food security, the fight against climate change, education, health – in particular for HIV sufferers – and maternal and reproductive health. With the Cashman report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for the European Council of 17 June to endorse the proposal for a 0.05% tax on international financial transactions, which would yield EUR 10 billion, and to set itself the target of achieving 0.63% of European GNI in 2012, with a view to increasing it to 0.7%.</p>

Much still remains to be done, and much support must be given if less developed countries are to achieve the MDGs of eradicating poverty and providing access to education and health care services. Europe, as a champion of fundamental human rights, with solidarity as its basic principle, and as the world’s largest contributor of development aid, must take a leading role in this matter, particularly at the next UN debriefing, which is to take place in September.

The EU as a whole has been reducing its aid budget, while its countries have recently spent thousands of millions of dollars on saving their banks, passing on the bill to the people while leaving the economic and financial groups that control them unscathed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the text contains some contradictions which we think are worth pointing out, not least when it criticises the liberalisation of trade while simultaneously supporting the opening up of trade through the conclusion of the Doha Round, within the context of the World Trade Organisation, and accepting the Economic Partnership agreements and Free Trade Areas. Trade liberalisation exacerbates inequality, creating greater exploitation of workers and natural resources, more poverty and more social exclusion, and it increases dependency relationships between countries.

Scotland, for example has a distinctive contribution to make in its work with developing countries and the Scottish Government has also published an International Development Policy aimed at contributing towards Millennium Development Goals.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I would like to refer to point 14 in the report on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which calls on the EU to provide significant funding to try and help poor nations fight the effects of climate change and, moreover, insists that these funds be additional to existing development aid commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Climate change is a fact, and we must learn to live with it. One of the significant errors that the environmental movement has made in its assessment of the situation is that, for a long time, it refused to discuss adaptation. This was something of a luxury in the West, because measures to adapt and the funding needed to accomplish this were not an option for the world’s poor. Copenhagen can take the credit for the establishment of the climate fund for the developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The significance of climate change among the problems that the developing countries face should not, however, be exaggerated. It would seem that climate change is cannibalising all the other problems in our imaginations. People have got it into their heads that if we cut emissions, all the other problems will just melt away. Nothing could be further from the truth. We need to make sure that we do not prevent hundreds of millions of children from receiving vaccinations and education or jeopardise the fight against erosion or other solvable environmental problems all in the name of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The best way to help the climate is to help people out of poverty, because poverty, if anything, prompts people to resort to environmentally harmful solutions. For this reason, I believe it is very important that the report should expressly state that money earmarked for fighting and adapting to climate change should not come out of the EU’s other development aid commitments.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This report contains some positive points. They include the emphasis placed on the environmental debt of the countries of the North in relation to those of the South and the request for additional aid in this area. I also support the request for the write-off of sovereign debt to no longer be regarded as an integral part of official development assistance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same applies to the demand to establish a fair distribution of wealth, support for local smallholdings and measures to foster access to land, water and other biodiversity resources. However, it is regrettable that, having put forward such proposals, the report should support Economic Partnership agreements, the Doha Round and all the World Trade Organisation agreements; in other words, that it should support the opposite of the principles it promotes.

      <p sl="pt">The EU remains the main driving force towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and it is also the world’s largest provider of aid. This means that it must take on its responsibilities and play a leading role in the high-level meeting of the UN which is to take place in September 2010. Fulfilling the MDGs, especially the eradication of poverty, is crucial in bringing an end to the suffering of millions of people all over the world. However, it is important to note that once again, slyly using the fight against poverty as a pretext, there is an attempt to surreptitiously include references to issues that are fundamentally divisive, particularly abortion policies in developing countries, and which are not given the visibility that they merit.</p>

      <p sl="de">Reducing poverty has been one of the main aims of development policy since time immemorial. Little has been achieved in recent decades, however; rather, development policy initiatives have often moved in the opposite direction. It is particularly concerning that in many states, funds from industrial nations have been used to keep dictators or ruling classes in power and to suppress the poor masses. Even programmes to combat famine have apparently merely allowed explosive growth in population numbers. In any event, if we are to combat poverty, it is necessary to prevent food speculation and to revise development policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Micro-loans are clearly a good approach for providing self-help. We should also be able to expect, however, that states which receive development aid take back migrants who have entered our countries illegally. We are unlikely to achieve the aims set until development aid is comprehensively revised. I therefore rejected the report.</p>

The European Union, which is the world’s biggest donor of development aid, should take action to realise its priorities, such as reducing and eliminating poverty. In relation to this, we expect the European Council to adopt a united position on the matter when it meets at the summit in June 2010, several months before the UN high-level meeting on assessment of the progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals. For problems in developing countries, such as poverty, hunger, health care and education, must be combated consistently.</p>

The lack of clarity regarding the idea behind the expression ‘safe abortion’ was impossible to ignore. Abortion, although necessary in some exceptional circumstances, must not be regarded as a method of contraception. What is more, like all medical procedures, it is never without risk. We must not trivialise it. Development depends first and foremost on respect for life.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I want to see Europe shouldering its responsibility, starting with the 0.7% target. A more coherent development policy is also required. The agricultural subsidies we give to European farmers mean that farmers in developing countries cannot obtain a good price for their products. Making poverty history begins with fair trade.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The objective presented in the Millennium Development Goal programme is very noble and I think that we must make every effort to achieve it. Lithuania is a small country with a limited bilateral development budget. Global aims are complex and sometimes unattainable for us. Most of our bilateral aid (around 50%) is directed towards countries which are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy. That is not because we are any less concerned about populations in Africa or the Caribbean than we are about people closer to home. For Lithuania and countries in a similar situation, the important thing is not the small allocation of funds but its effectiveness. As far as possible, we need to achieve better results with relatively few resources and that is not always possible to achieve in far off countries. It is important for us to help where we can, if not through the funds, then by sharing our experience of integration and other research that could be useful. Poverty reduction, whether in Lithuania or the furthest corner of Africa, should be one of our greatest priorities. The fight against corruption and aid for the poorest – that is our moral duty and a long-term interest of the EU. There has been a rise in the number of people who are underemployed or whose jobs are insecure and therefore, it is important for us to direct all of our efforts towards protecting, above all, the interests of the most vulnerable groups.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is extremely important, in fact. I can tell you that our American partners consider this to be probably one of the first priorities, if not the first priority, in the current discussions with the European Union. This agreement is crucial for European Union relations with the US. Since 1 January 2010, significant volumes of data which were previously received by the US Administration have not been available, and this is creating problems in their programme. That is why we believe we should also solve this, bearing in mind the importance of transatlantic relations. Of course, these transatlantic relations are critically important, but this does not mean that we should not stick to our principles of privacy and data protection.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, rest assured that I am not going to ask questions about Swift – we will speak about that later – but, yesterday, Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy had their summit. They decided on an economic governance approach in the Union and not in the euro area. Personally, I do not believe that this is a very pertinent decision, because it is not a matter of pitting the euro area against the European Union. We need economic governance in the European Union and we need economic governance in the euro area – we need it in both. Moreover, we need it even more strongly in the euro area than in the European Union since we have the single currency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My question to Mr Barroso is as follows: what do you think about this? Do you agree with us that we need economic governance as much in the euro area as in the European Union? Secondly, we believe that the Commission must be the one to oversee this economic governance. It is impossible for a Council that meets four times a year to ensure that economic governance takes place in Europe with all the problems that we are having. It is now up to the Commission to move into the driving seat. I would also like to know the Commission’s position on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, of course, when it comes to the powers that are already granted to the Union, the Commission is the economic government of Europe. That is the only solution that is compatible with the treaty.

      <p sl="fr">Having said that, the Commission alone cannot fulfil this task. We must work in concert with the Council, which has some very important powers, and also with the European Council, which gives general direction and impetus to the work of the Union. I also agree with your first statement. In fact, we have the solution for the euro area and for the whole of the European Union. Just read Article 136. Article 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon now offers us far greater opportunities to come up with proposals for the euro area, because it actually has special meaning within the euro area; more duties also means more rights, not only for those who share a currency, but also for the Union as a whole. Therefore, I hope that the economic governance of the European Union will be strengthened, but always in accordance with the spirit of the treaty and of the Community method.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to ask you to say once again whether you believe that the directive on environmental liability for sub sea oil and gas production is sufficient. I would like to know whether you believe that the non-uniform, relatively low upper limits on liability are really what we need in the light of the catastrophe in the Gulf. I would also like to know whether you are debating urgent improvements to technical inspections on platforms. Do you really believe that the environmental and climatic conditions in the Arctic are friendly enough to humans and technology for us to enter into the risks of sub sea oil production there too? It may not be quite as deep as in the Gulf of Mexico, but the conditions are tough.</p>

      <p sl="en">Yes, you are right. Firstly, we have legislation. We have binding new standards and requirements applicable to offshore drilling and oil production facilities as regards equipment standards, worker safety, environmental sustainability, emergency prevention and preparedness. In addition, the Member States have enacted extensive national legislation to maintain a high level of safety of offshore operations in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we have an information response system ready to fight disasters caused by oil spills from tankers or drilling and production facilities. This system includes a set of tools managed by the European Maritime Agency, focusing on prevention of pollution and response to pollution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, there is a Community civil protection mechanism that can give a response to any major crisis situation. Regarding the concrete point you made on liability, most European legislation on safety and the environment does not target particular industries, but we can see that this legislation is applicable to all relevant economic sectors. EU legislation sets minimum safety standards which individual Member States must strive to meet through their legislation. This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>

My supplementary deals with the question of sharing the burden on counter-terrorism between the United States and the European Union.

      <p sl="en">What we are accepting by this agreement is to provide some data, subject to strict conditions, to the American authorities, but we could also think about what we could do better among ourselves. The Americans told us they were ready to help us technically because they have more investment in that area than we have. I think that could be something for the future because I believe that we must all contribute to the fight against terrorism.

      <p sl="de">So far, however, the EU and its Member States have not met their obligations. There is currently a deficit of EUR 20 billion in the commitments made for achieving the Millennium Development Goals alone. I would therefore like to know what you are going to do – and specifically as regards the forthcoming Council meeting – to remind the Member States in particular of their commitments and to exert pressure on the EU to provide a clear, final picture at the UN conference in September and not to allow the individual Member States to repeatedly shirk their responsibilities in view of the growing crisis, when 1 billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission had a meeting some days ago in Addis Ababa with the African Union Commission, and one of the points raised by our partners in Africa was that sometimes they feel that commitments are not respected. So it is question of credibility and accountability, also on our side.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, certainly, the Commission will defend the fact that we should keep our commitments. For instance, the commitments taken in terms of fast-start financing for the fight against climate change. I intend to go to the high-level event in New York. Just today, I received a letter from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon highlighting the importance of this agenda, and we fully share his concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will raise the issue not only in the European Council this week, but also in the G20 and G8 outreach meetings the week afterwards in Canada. So, we remain very much committed to this.</p>

For me, the question is what has been done within the Commission to create the structures, the resources and the conditions to implement, for example, the Twelve Point Plan drawn up by the Commission, and particularly by Commissioner Piebalgs. In other words, what is the Commission itself doing to create the conditions for policy coherence?

Just recently, we adopted a very important, ambitious programme in terms of a mechanism or a facility for helping countries with problems of debt. It is, in fact, some kind of obligation which Member States take to the financial markets, so I believe it will be extremely difficult to now get from the Member States the agreement with the Eurobonds principle for this kind of projects. Nevertheless, I think there are some possibilities of using other mechanisms. In my programme, I spoke, for instance, about having some public/private partnerships; I spoke about involving the European Investment Bank in a better way; we are looking very openly at all the possibilities of financing for those very important projects. But if you want my honest answer, it is that it would be difficult, if not impossible, now to get Eurobonds for that specific purpose.</p>

We have seen during this crisis that the decisions taken by one country have a very direct spill-over effect on the other countries.

      <p sl="en">You are completely right when you underline what I have been calling the holistic approach to economic policy. It is a mistake and I think now Member States are well aware of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we speak about economic policy in Europe, just to consider the Stability and Growth Pact or just to consider the financial services reform, it all comes down to growth. To have sustainable growth, we need of course to have sound economic governance in Europe, we have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, and we need the credibility of sound public finances, but we also need new regulatory supervision for the financial market and we need to invest in our potential for growth. This is precisely what EU 2020 is about. It is about reform. That is why I am insisting that we need fiscal consolidation and structural reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, of course, we need to pursue the economic policies that are so important for us in Europe, namely in terms of economic and social cohesion – not only for 16 – or 17, because I hope that Estonia will join the euro area very soon – but for all the 27 Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr van Rompuy – the President of the Council – wants to use the task force to rapidly create new rules on the euro in order to manoeuvre the EU out of the current euro crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commission President, you have already cited Article 121 several times. You speak quite rightly of mutual dependence and of the fact that economic policy naturally does not only concern the individual Member State. My specific question to you, Mr Barroso, is as follows: to what extent is the task force preparing possible sanctions against states that repeatedly infringe budgetary rules? Can the Commission imagine withdrawing EU subsidies or withdrawing structural funds? What does the Commission think of the idea of the temporary withdrawal of voting rights as a possible sanction? Finally, what is the Commission’s position on demands for a uniform insolvency rule for insolvent Member States?</p>

      <p sl="en">You have raised many questions. First of all, what we are doing now in the task force and indeed in the Commission – a communication on 12 May already mentioned this – is examining the possibility of reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact, including by broadening the arsenal of incentives for compliance, as I prefer to call it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe it makes sense to have these incentives for compliance – some people speak of sanctions – because we need the credibility of those instruments to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact is respected. As we have seen, the problem was that some Member States did not respect the treaty that they themselves had adopted and ratified.</p>
      <p sl="en">How can we do this? We want to do it in a fair manner, not just penalising those countries that are in the Cohesion Fund. That is why we are looking for ways of implementing those incentives for compliance, irrespective of whether or not the countries are cohesion countries. Those incentives for compliance can be reinforced in several ways, for instance, more upstream, including using them in the preventive part of the Pact, or more consequently, for instance with an increased degree of automaticity. We are looking at several ways and the Commission will put forward some legislative proposals on this.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to hear you talk about unemployment when detailing the objectives of the task force on economic governance, because you have referred on numerous occasions to the strategy as a strategy for intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, it should be inclusive, above all, for the more than 20 million Europeans who feel excluded because they have been shut out of the labour market by the brutal crisis. There are more than 20 million unemployed people who want clarification when we tell them that economic governance, stability and supervision – the economic and financial supervision package – will be reflected in a strategy that is directly aimed at getting all those people who have been personally affected by the outbreak of the crisis back to work, with ambitions of increased productivity and, hence, competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="es">In particular, I would like to hear you say how it will be reflected in the participation of those EU Member States that will be involved in this opportunity, which must not be squandered, and which must be relevant to the defining of new rules for global economic governance at the upcoming G20 meeting in Toronto.</p>

We cannot look only at certain rules of governance relating to the Stability and Growth Pact; we have to also look at what we can do for growth within Europe, especially in order to ensure that growth is sustainable and inclusive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have said on numerous occasions that we do not want the costs of this amendment, of this adjustment, to be borne by the weakest. They were not the ones who caused the crisis. For that reason, we think that there must be better redistribution of the sacrifice, and also, as Mr López Aguilar has said, that there needs to be an external dimension. That is why we are going to the G20 determined to propose mechanisms for the financial sector’s contribution to the response to the crisis, while also seeking to strengthen a common European position on the world stage, especially within the G20.</p>

We have made reference to the 3%, but we have not just mentioned research and development but also the concept of innovation, since this is not only a question of basic research but how research is translated into economic activity. What can research do to produce more growth and more employment? As you know, there is not a well-established indicator for innovation, which is a technical issue dividing some experts.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally have been discussing this with the OECD for instance. The Secretary-General of the OECD and some of his experts came to Brussels recently, and we are working with them and others to have an indicator of innovation that could be agreed upon by the academic community and the policy-making community. That is what we are doing, and we certainly want to do so in open consultation, so we very much welcome all contributions to this. It is a highly technical point, but I believe that it is critically important that we develop better indicators for innovation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we know that the escalation of the economic and social situation is a matter of concern for many of the EU Member States. Economic growth remains very weak and is insufficient to reduce unemployment and create the jobs that the EU needs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, the measures that are being taken, especially austerity policies in the name of compliance with the Stability Pact and its criteria, not only run counter to the need for job creation and economic growth, but they are also exacerbating inequality and poverty. Thus, in the European Year for Combating Poverty itself, we see a situation where exclusion, poverty and unemployment are on the increase.</p>
      <p sl="pt">So I wonder, Mr President, do you not think that there is a pressing need to give priority in these macro-economic policies to social sustainability, rather than continuing to insist on financial sustainability, which undermines social sustainability itself? Do you not think that it is time to revisit the Stability and Growth Pact and its irrational criteria, and to give priority to employment and the fight for social inclusion?</p>

      <p sl="pt">In relation to poverty, we ourselves made combating poverty and the fight for social inclusion one of the objectives of the 2020 strategy, along with some concrete goals, and I agree that nowadays there is a greater risk of poverty in our societies. We are seeing new poverty phenomena which are extremely worrying. That is why governments must examine how they can respond to this issue as part of their priorities, but the solution – I must reiterate – cannot be found in budgetary indiscipline, because if this is the solution, we will probably see the situation deteriorate in some countries and, by extension, the situation for the most vulnerable within those countries.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, today’s debate in the European Parliament concerns the activities of credit rating agencies and the impact they have on the global and European economy. The European Union and the European Central Bank have issued regulations granting credit rating agencies, such as Moody’s, SnP and Fitch, the right to evaluate not only businesses but also the Member States of the European Union themselves.</p>
      <p sl="el">When the crisis broke, the same institutions of the European Union recognised the very negative role played by credit rating agencies. Whereas one would have expected the European Commission to limit the role of these agencies, on the contrary, their role was upgraded and formalised in a new regulation in November 2009.</p>
      <p sl="el">Credit rating agencies had already started to downgrade Greece’s credit rating at the beginning of 2009 and, as a result, it pays double the interest rate it paid before and has entered a vicious circle of depreciation and speculative borrowing. We all know what the final results were. Just yesterday, Moody’s tried yet again to generate a negative climate for the Greek economy and the euro with a blatant speculative intervention, by downgrading the state of the Greek economy by 4 points for no good reason.</p>
      <p sl="el">Moody’s is one of the three private US companies which the European Union officially recognises for the purpose of rating the Member States’ economies, despite the fact that it is being accused by every economist, politician and institutional player in Europe and the USA of bearing huge responsibility for the recent crisis.</p>
      <p sl="el">To be precise, it was this agency that was accused by former analysts in the US Congress of being forced by their superiors to give toxic securities a positive rating. It was this agency that is being accused by dozens of businesses of being coerced through ratings into paying fees. It was this agency which, together with the rest of the ‘Holy Trinity’, namely SnP and Fitch, received dozens of complaints from municipalities, regions and states in the United States which were mislead into undertaking investments and lost millions of dollars. It was this agency that is being accused by numerous insurance funds that lost their investments due to erroneous ratings. The insurance fund of the State of Ohio alone lost USD 450 million.</p>
      <p sl="el">As we know all this, as it is unacceptable for European economies to be rated by self-seeking private US agencies, this job should be undertaken by a public, democratically controlled agency which has no connection to private interests. However, instead of this, Mr Barnier, we see the Commission filibustering even today, with the result that the speculation mafia continue to coerce and direct economic policy at the expense of the workers and citizens of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that the European Parliament should, at long last, accept its responsibilities, intervene and demand that the European Commission and the Council, having consulted the European Parliament, legislate directly to put an end to this unacceptable situation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is seeking to draw attention with this oral question to the problems concerning credit rating agencies. Our aim is to find out from the European Commission what the next steps will be, starting with the possibility of creating a European credit rating agency which we support and feel is taking shape, partly in the light of what President Barroso himself has said on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must give praise where praise is due and acknowledge that credit rating agencies have achieved virtually the impossible: they have managed to play a decisive role both in the very early stages of the 2008 financial crisis, during the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and now at this second stage, which began with the debt crisis in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="it">In 2008, they disregarded – and, in some cases, even promoted – the risks of toxic products, and now they have decided to do their bit for the stability of the markets by slashing the ratings of Greece, Portugal and Spain, just when the negotiations between the European Union, the IMF and the Greek Government were under way. President Buzek, there are no two ways about it: these people are evil!</p>
      <p sl="it">Now, it is not that I want to put all the blame for what has happened in the world and in Europe on credit rating agencies. However, the fact that they are always present at the scene of the crime – and I am referring to the Parmalat case, the Enron case, the Lehman Brothers case – ought to make us react in a more appropriate and practical manner than we are at present, since we are doing nothing.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, when will an inquiry be carried out into this affair and into this sector? We worked on this with Mr Gauzès a while ago, when we drafted the regulation on credit rating agencies. A sectoral inquiry is now required in order to shed some light on the scandalous, unacceptable situation in which a concentration and oligopoly are being created in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let us get a grip on the situation before things get even worse and let us turn our words into deeds. As well as the need to create a European public agency, we should also reflect on the role that independent courts of auditors can play in providing an assessment of sovereign debts, thus absolving private agencies of the responsibility for them.</p>
      <p sl="it">President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel – and I shall conclude here – have officially asked the European Commission to draft some proposals to strengthen competition in the credit rating market. It is a pity that in the European Council, in which President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel sit, it is, in fact, the governments that are delaying the approval of the financial supervision package and thus preventing ESMA, the European authority that will be responsible for monitoring, from being set up.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, President Sarkozy, Chancellor Merkel, you should put your own house in order before telling President Barroso what to do.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies were a matter of concern to this Parliament at the end of its previous term, and I should like to highlight in this regard the responsiveness of both the Commission and Parliament, which has adopted a regulation on credit rating agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we are raising this issue once again because of the observations that it has been possible to make about the role of credit rating agencies during the crisis. They can be criticised for not having seen the crisis coming, they can be criticised for the volatility of their ratings and for their untimely decisions in announcing their ratings, especially when they relate to sovereign debt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I believe that we must examine this issue with a clear head. Firstly, the fact that credit rating agencies rate products that they have submitted to investors is not, in itself, shocking. Investors who invest, who provide funds, are entitled to try to discover the risks or the difficulties that may arise, just as they are entitled to try to discover which ratings are good.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where the situation becomes slightly more ambiguous is when these ratings are used, in banking regulations, to determine the amounts of own funds that banks must have in exchange for some of their investments. From this point of view, the 2009 regulation does not really provide a solution since the idea was to provide for both the approval and the supervision of credit rating agencies. Therefore, a rating may be legitimate, but is it legitimate to issue ratings as the agencies do?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the texts that you will propose – I would emphasise, Commissioner, that you have just submitted the text on the introduction of European supervision of credit rating agencies within the framework of the new financial regulation – must enable a solution to be found to these issues, especially that of competition in the field of credit rating agencies. From my perspective, I do not think that simply confirming the creation of a European agency, even if it is public, solves the problems. If the idea is to have an agency that issues ratings in a kinder, more generous fashion than the others, it will not be of much use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More questions need to be asked, in my opinion, about the conditions in which the agencies issue their ratings. There are ratings of private enterprises, and there are ratings of sovereign debt. I shall emphasise the ratings of sovereign debt. The authority which, at Parliament’s request, will be responsible for monitoring and supervising those agencies that will operate in Europe is ESMA, the new financial services authority. I also think that the powers conferred on ESMA should include the possibility not only to supervise the agencies effectively, but also, as regards sovereign debt, to provide for a facility by which to monitor, though not censure, the way in which credit rating agencies issue sovereign debt ratings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot allow a situation – and such situations have indeed arisen – in which, 15 minutes before the markets close, an agency downgrades a country, thus giving rise to completely undesirable consequences. In fact, what needs to be done is to implement a preventive system that will force credit rating agencies to inform the supervisor, within a very short timescale, if need be, of the conditions in which they envisage issuing ratings so that the supervisor can verify both that the standard procedures have been followed and, above all, that the conditions in which the ratings are issued will not adversely affect the situation as regards, in particular, sovereign debt. The debt of businesses is not the same as that of states; it deserves to be treated differently. That being said, some people have mentioned the Court of Auditors, but such courts do not exist in every European country, and they are not all independent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, Mr President, Commissioner, is the thrust of our questions. How can we improve the operating methods of credit rating agencies and, above all, the dissemination of information, and how can we improve competition?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, you come from a country in which ratings always tend to cause a stir – I am talking about the Michelin Guide’s best restaurant ratings. Therefore, we are not going to say that we are against ratings, since, after all, they also make for healthy competition and enable different standards of performance to be rewarded.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, I fully agree with what Mr Gauzès said just now. It is not a question of demonising rating agencies. It is really about looking at the conditions in which they operate. In the case in point, these are institutions that have really quite considerable powers, and that is why we must look closely at the way in which they work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Gauzès just pre-empted me by saying that there is a difference between the rating of private businesses and that of sovereign debt. In both cases, however, the problem is the same; in other words, is the methodology right? Are the right criteria being used to assess what a business is doing or how a State is managing its debt? Secondly, are the potential links between the rating agency and the subject of the rating transparent enough?</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of that in fact merits close examination and supervision, and we are grateful to you for forging ahead with the proposals that Parliament itself made during the last parliamentary term, with regard to Mr Gauzès’s report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, I believe that it is very important that we continue the work that Parliament has already embarked on. I share the view that a European rating agency is not necessarily the top priority today. What is important is that we ensure that the supervisory work, as it stands today, as it is being performed, is monitored.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On that note, I should like to say a word about ESMA, this authority that is due to be established shortly. I am one of the rapporteurs for the financial supervision package, as is Mr Giegold, who is in this Chamber and who is the rapporteur for ESMA. I should like to launch an appeal to the Member States – the Presidency is not here, but I know how capable you are of transmitting messages to it, Commissioner, and also how appreciative we are of your efforts to make progress on this matter. I believe that the Member States must adopt a serious approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One cannot, on the one hand, make fine statements to the media because one is justifiably upset about the consequences of certain decisions taken by the agencies and, on the other, throw a spanner in the works when it comes to the creation of this new authority, ESMA. We really want this authority to be clearly identified, to be equipped with strong powers at European level, and, in particular, to be able to supervise rating agencies. This will be one of its tasks, and an important one at that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This also reflects our desire to see, for example, market infrastructure and clearing houses supervised by a European authority. There is a lack of transparency on the market that worries us. We are not hostile to competition, far from it. We are not hostile to competition among stakeholders, far from it. To put it simply, the way in which their services are assessed must comply with the rules of transparency and serious conduct, which characterise markets worthy of the name.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, once again, we encourage you to forge ahead and we call on the States not to hinder the process of getting ESMA off the ground, not to empty the supervision package of all content, because, if vetoes are applied, we could ultimately find ourselves being unable to supervise that which each and every one of us, in this House and in the capitals, wants to subject to more rigorous supervision.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I should like you to hear my honest opinion and to fully appreciate my determination on this matter, as on others that concern the lessons learnt from the crisis and the transparency to which citizens and businesses are entitled. I also had the opportunity, on 20 April, to speak to you about this issue of credit rating agencies and their importance for the functioning of the economy and of the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to checking whether a product, a business, and, if necessary, a State – I refer here to sovereign risk, and I shall come back to this subject – is in good health or has a fever, you will agree with me, Mrs Goulard, ladies and gentlemen, that breaking the thermometer does not cure the fever. The question is whether the thermometer works properly and, if necessary, whether we can use several thermometers to perform the validations and checks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I feel that there is plenty to say about the functioning of the thermometer and, hence, about the functioning of credit rating agencies, which play a major role in assessing the risks associated with the situation of businesses and States alike. The crisis has shown, and continues to show, Mr Chountis – you are right – that they have not always functioned in an exemplary manner, with very serious consequences at times.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is an area, ladies and gentlemen, in which the G20 has taken strong decisions – as it has on other matters – and the decisions in this case have involved the introduction of supervision and rules of governance. I would remind you that, at the time of the crisis – many of you have mentioned this, including Mr Gauzès and Mrs Goulard – the Commission quickly assumed its responsibilities, and it has made the regulation of the activities of credit rating agencies a priority over the last two years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In September 2009 – in other words, one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers – the regulation on credit rating agencies was adopted with the very strong support, help and improvements of Parliament – and I am grateful once again to Mr Gauzès – in order to address the problems that the operating methods of these agencies were causing and which contributed, in a way, to the financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The regulation introduced a system of mandatory registration for all agencies established in the Union and imposed a set of stringent requirements to ensure, as far as possible, that there are no more potential conflicts of interest, to improve the quality of ratings and the methodology used, and, finally, to ensure that agencies operate in a more transparent way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that these new rules will noticeably improve the independence and integrity of the rating process, will make these rating activities more transparent, and will improve the quality of ratings themselves, including ratings of the sovereign debt of the countries of the European Union and of the financial institutions of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two weeks ago, on 2 June – this is the second stage – the Commission, at my instigation, adopted a proposed amendment to the regulation on credit rating agencies in order to entrust the future European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with sole responsibility for the ongoing registration and supervision of credit rating agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, ESMA still needs to be set up, and I fully agree with what was said a moment ago by Mrs Goulard and which you all believe: as we discussed recently with the rapporteurs for the supervision package, for the de Larosière package, a dynamic, credible compromise must be reached between Parliament and the Council in order to implement what has been proposed, which is the creation of these three independent authorities on 1 January. We are not there yet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must make an effort, and here I call once again on this House, on the Council and Parliament, to come closer to agreement. I repeat, Mr President, the Commission’s willingness, and my willingness in particular, to help bring about this dynamic compromise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, in order to increase the benefits of transparency and to boost competition among credit rating agencies, a provision has been introduced to facilitate access to information on the structured financial products of any credit rating agencies interested in publishing an unsolicited credit rating.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In other words, when an agency receives information enabling it to work out its credit rating on structured products, the other agencies will have the right to use that information to work out their own rating.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the stage we are at. It is not enough. It is becoming ever more widely accepted, in Europe and throughout the world, that the current failings in credit rating procedures, which have been brought to light by the crisis, have not been sufficiently addressed, and I wish to voice my agreement with Mr Chountis on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I have asked my services to undertake a new assessment of the entire architecture and role of credit rating agencies. It is within this framework, Mr Pittella, that, in the coming months, we will carry out what you called an inquiry, but in any case an objective, very precise analysis and examination of the operating methods of these agencies in the light of and in accordance with the new legislation, even though it is not yet fully implemented; we will have to wait until early December for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I, like all of you, ladies and gentlemen, believe that there is a problem, and it is quite simply to do with the diversity of this market. This market is too concentrated; it is in too few hands. There is not enough competition in this sector, and that worries us. Without singling out one particular option for the moment, Mr Pittella, the Commission is looking at structural measures, including the creation of an independent European credit rating agency, which for some of us – I am speaking for myself here – is a welcome thing, particularly when it comes to sovereign risk ratings, which were mentioned just now by Mr Gauzès, as well as by Mrs Goulard and Mr Pittella.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another structural measure that we are considering is the increased participation of independent public bodies in the credit rating process. Particular attention must be paid to sovereign debt – since that is what we are referring to when we talk about Greece and possibly about other States too – in order to ensure that the methods employed are indeed the right ones and that they are appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The lack of due diligence on the part of the banks and the other financial establishments, and the lack of alternative criteria for assessing the reliability of an investment also merit special attention. The current financial regulations, which expressly provide for the use of credit ratings, also need to be thoroughly re-examined.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are all the issues, and we will not sidestep any of the difficult matters on which the Commission is working. We will be able to present our initial guidelines in September and, at the same time, we will address other important matters relating to transparency and monitoring in the context of the regulation of derivative products and short selling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, we will table some legislative proposals at the end of this year or at the very start of 2011, not only to continue – I am echoing what you said, Mrs Goulard – what was begun by my predecessor with your support, which is being implemented but which is not enough, but also to achieve a greater degree of transparency so as to prevent conflicts of interest and to ensure that these ratings are greater in number, more diverse and, when it comes to sovereign risk, above reproach.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, the credit rating agencies were not able to anticipate the subprime mortgage crisis, the risk of structured financial products, or the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p>
      <p sl="es">The regulation adopted in April 2009 promotes their transparency, submits the agencies themselves to European supervision, and begins to deal with issues relating to their responsibility and quality, tackling some of the conflicts of interest in their operations; the Commission’s new proposal continues along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am convinced that we in Parliament are going to contribute to the existence of supervision from 1 January 2011 and, furthermore, cooperate in supervision projects in order for there to be a stricter regulatory framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">The role that the credit rating agencies are playing in the debt and public deficit crisis, revealing the discretional nature of the methods used for their ratings, how they are prepared and how they are communicated; the highly pro-cyclical impact of the ratings of agencies that have sometimes been described as pyromaniac firemen who stoke the fires even further; and their clash with the positions of the main international and European financial institutions to the extent that the European Central Bank has decided to disregard their ratings in sovereign debt transactions: all of these make it necessary to reconsider their role in a more in-depth way and match them up to the general interests.</p>
      <p sl="es">Questions are now being openly raised as to whether the credit rating agencies are capable of making objective and responsible evaluations, in particular, of sovereign debt. The questions that are being asked are of a deeper nature – as you said, a structural nature – and affect their compatibility with democratic principles, because they have a bearing on the efforts that pensioners, workers and vulnerable parts of the population are making, and which they do not wish to see wasted and trampled on by irresponsibility in how the markets operate.</p>
      <p sl="es">They are questions that affect independence. Are public credit rating agencies compatible with private ownership? Is it possible to be both judge and interested party? Is it possible to have a credit rating as a business model based on payments by the very actors who are to be examined? Can the actors themselves choose who examines them?</p>
      <p sl="es">The United States Senate is already tackling these issues and we need to tackle them here too; they are issues that affect responsibility and sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="es">Can responsible governance be ensured, that avoids short-term perspectives and ensures stability? Can the agencies remain indifferent to the commitments of the European authorities and the efforts of the main international public actors? Will they respond to the effects of the market, above all, of their consequences that could – as you have said – be classified as harmful? Will the privileges of regulation be maintained? Will the regulator be bound by the rules that call for their ratings to be used? Will there continue to be a lack of competition?</p>
      <p sl="es">As far as legitimacy is concerned, can agencies maintain so much influence over our economies with such little control? Is it necessary to go beyond supervisory control and go to the internal control of the structure of governance itself, and even the structure of business itself?</p>
      <p sl="es">A public European credit rating system should be established and a new role imposed on the existing European agencies, while new agencies should be promoted and the need for a global rating system following new principles should be considered.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are the questions to which answers are needed, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, not so long ago, voices were raised to say that rating agencies should not have downgraded Greek and other bonds. ‘Look at what it has done to the euro,’ they said.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now I was going to say whether any more needed to be said to prove the huge conflict of interest that there would be if countries effectively rated their own debt. Then this morning, in the debate on statistics, Commissioner Rehn said yesterday’s downgrade by Moody’s was not ‘conveniently timed’ and that that would influence Commission thinking on credit rating agency regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am sorry, I do understand frustration, but my thoughts were: have you gone mad? I do not want ratings that are ‘convenient’, whether that be ‘convenient’ for investment banks or ‘convenient’ for central banks. Indeed, ratings have been a bit too ‘convenient’ for regulators to lean on too, driving out proper due diligence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, a public agency for non-sovereign assets has some attractions, but how do we get over the implied guarantee? How do we get over political interference if bank capital is at risk with the macro-economic consequences of that?</p>
      <p sl="de">We have some way to go in the search for capacity, independence and integrity, but of one thing I am sure, and that is that corporate governance principles play a part, be it in the public or private sector, and that should apply to ESMA and the other ESAs too.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barnier, thank you for speaking in German.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, I would like to say that the crises that we have yet again experienced once more raise certain key issues. In addition to what has already been said, I would like to particularly re-emphasise certain aspects. One is that the rating agencies have frequently turned out to be guessing agencies; in other words, agencies that were no more capable of assessing the risks than anyone else. Consequently, we must considerably reduce the importance that is placed on the assessments made by these rating agencies as compared with other assessments in the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second central problem that has emerged is the oligopolisation of this market. There are only a few serious providers. As a result, it makes sense to expand the number of providers and also their backgrounds. To this extent, your comments, Mr Barnier, on bringing more players into the market – which have also been echoed by others here – make sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we have the central problem of incentives, about which little has been said so far in this debate. For what do we find among the rating agencies? A situation in which those who give the ratings are selected by their clients from among the few agencies that exist and are paid for doing so. It is as akin to university students visiting their professor before their exams and negotiating payment with him, with everyone wondering afterwards why the grades were systematically so high. We need to look at this problem of incentives.</p>
      <p sl="de">I know that the Commission is also giving some thought to how we can ensure that those that offer a financial product can no longer select, as it were, their rating agency. This takes us to the heart of the reforms required in those sectors where private providers are involved – those that are subjected to rating; in other words, in the areas other than government bonds. We need to remove this false incentive system. Rather than replacing a private oligopoly with a public monopoly, as has sometimes been suggested by those on the left, we should ensure that a public agency ensures that different players are continually selected to provide ratings and that the quality of the ratings is made public and systematically checked.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barnier, I look forward to your proposals. I hope that these proposals will result in us being able to systematically resolve the problems that remain in this area following previous efforts, including those of Mr Gauzès and the previous Commission and the Council – for which we are grateful; and that we are able to do so without creating a new monopoly, but rather by consistently getting to grips with the problems of incentives and regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it was clear very early in the financial crisis that there had been huge failings on the part of credit rating agencies. Hence, it was one of the first things addressed by the EU last year. Updating the directive to cast responsibility for the EU activities of the predominantly US-based agencies is to be welcomed as a move to monitor their activity more closely here in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Credit rating agencies are extremely powerful organisations and have the ability to move the markets with a change of rating. Their independence needs, therefore, to be ascertained and maintained at all times. However, any rating decisions that trigger a flow of billions of euros should not come as a surprise to the market. For example, credit rating agencies should publish their ongoing stress tests and scenario analyses so as to improve market transparency and minimise shocks.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we must remember what it is credit rating agencies are set up to do: to assess the risk of default of an entity, be it a product or a corporation, especially a publicly listed company including financial institutions or even sovereign states. In the same way that we should not blame credit rating agencies for responding to legitimate information on the state of our banks, we should not use them as an excuse for the market’s reaction to the dire state of our public finances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although monitoring their activity more closely is to be supported, a more critical proposal needs to be framed around a different question, namely: why have the markets, investors, corporations and sovereign states relied so heavily on credit rating agencies rather than conducting adequate due diligence and collecting information for themselves? In particular, why is the credit rating market dominated by three names when there are many more available to the marketplace? When we have answered these broader questions, then the way credit rating agencies are held to account will become more meaningful. With their great power and influence in the markets, there should also be significant responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would just like to remind you that the rating agency Moody downgraded Greece again last night. We all know that the Greek Government has placed enormous pressure on its people in recent weeks, in order to get the crisis under control. We all know that the European Union has put together a package worth EUR 750 billion in order to support the countries that have found themselves in crisis and to help them out of it. Nevertheless, Greece has been downgraded. In fact, the same fate has befallen Spain, as well, because it, too, has been downgraded after adopting a savings package.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barnier, you have just used the metaphor of a thermometer and said that it must not be broken. I do wonder, however, if a thermometer is really a suitable metaphor for rating agencies. A thermometer obviously does nothing to help improve the condition of the clients, the patient in question – which is something it just cannot do. After all, the thermometer is no drug and is obviously making the patient’s condition even worse. However, it is unacceptable that the countries which are making these efforts should end up being downgraded even further, despite everything they have done.</p>
      <p sl="de">This raises the question about what these rating agencies actually do. It has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming. Therefore, rating agencies did not help predict or diagnose the crisis. Shortly before it collapsed, Lehman Brothers received quite a positive rating. So, with the methods they used, they were not able or did not want to recognise what we had in store. In that respect, this instrument has been a total failure.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nor have they helped us manage the crisis. I have just given you a newspaper quote on that: ‘Ratings have not helped improve the crisis situation despite all the efforts made and there is concern’ – as the media put it – ‘that we will not be able to see through the packages we have put together’. This means they will pull us down and downgrade us even further.</p>
      <p sl="de">To conclude, I would like to point out that countries and companies are just not comparable. We have to take a closer look at these ratings. Just doing a bit of window dressing is not enough. What we need is a root-and-branch reform of rating systems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, credit rating agencies sold their souls to the devil some years ago when they started to rely on those companies whose bonds needed grading for payment. He who pays the piper calls the tune.</p>
      <p sl="en">It inevitably led to misgrading. Most credit rating agencies employ children who can barely read a balance sheet. They only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all. Paradoxically, it is usually the hedge funds who find out the truth behind the numbers. They exposed Enron, for example. But the truth about numbers can be unpopular, especially here, which is why we hate them.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, even the coke-sniffing youngsters at the credit agencies know that Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal are broke. Kaput is kaput in any language!</p>
      <p sl="en">So what does this House propose? Our own credit rating agency paid for by us, guaranteed to dance to our tune. It can stick AAA ratings to junk bonds issued by the eurozone’s failed economies. The question is, who would these fool? I suggest, with the exception of some English county councils and the BBC economics correspondents, virtually nobody. When the people of Europe realise that they have been the guinea pigs in a gigantic failed currency experiment, they will burn this place down and guillotine the lot of us, and who could blame them?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the harm caused by credit rating agencies is now plain to see. The sovereign debt crisis has just confirmed their pro-cyclical nature. Blind as they were before the fire started, credit rating agencies are acting like real arsonists, fanning the flames of the crisis. The Commission regulation of September 2009 has, as ever, gone unheeded. Due to their inherent lack of foresight, the European bodies are being forced, once again, to take urgent action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The proposals being submitted to us range from maintaining the law of the market, which is perverted by obvious conflicts of interest, to the Soviet-style excessive regulation beloved of the European Commission. We are jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. The desire recently expressed by Mr Barroso to place credit rating agencies under the supervision of the European Central Bank and of the Commission is simply unrealistic, especially after the astounding statement made by Mr Trichet in February 2010, and I quote: ‘The efforts to consolidate bank balance sheets require a high degree of confidentiality’. In other words, they require obscurity and secrecy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is clear that we are tackling the effects of the problem and not the causes. Knowing whether it is investors or issuers that have to pay the agencies, and whether the latter have to be private or public, independent or supervised, solves nothing. As Maurice Allais says, until such time as it is no longer possible to use credit ex nihilo to buy without having and to sell without owning, capitalism will go from boom to bust, with increasingly devastating consequences for nations and economies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Above all, then, we need to ban the creation of any money or bonds without real and tangible compensation. In so doing, we will put an end to the wild and irrational speculation of the markets, which means that there will no longer be a need for credit rating agencies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recent attack by European leaders on credit rating agencies, regarding the timing and degree of downgrades being meted out to countries’ sovereign debts, may be seen by some as somewhat exaggerated.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the failures of credit rating agencies are now well known – I think there is general agreement from all sides of Parliament on this. They have given high ratings to bonds that subsequently defaulted. Now that the tide has turned, and the economic outlook across Europe remains bleak, they are guilty of overreacting in the opposite direction. Not even an impressive and unprecedented EUR 750 billion package seemed to convince them. Having said that, we have to be careful when reacting to this, and not appearing to shoot the messenger just because he brings bad news.</p>
      <p sl="en">One thing is for sure: whether they overrate or underrate a financial product, the influence of the rating agencies on global financial markets is enormous. In effect, they can and do hold a country and its people to ransom, including workers and pensioners. This cannot but have political implications, which need to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to understand how rating agencies create and sell their ratings. The arrangement between the security issuer and the agencies is an obvious problem. Secondly, there is the question of the number of agencies themselves and the degree of effective competition between them. If banks and financial institutions are to be regulated, as they must be, why should rating agencies be treated any differently, especially given the oligopolistic structure of the rating agency market?</p>
      <p sl="en">The causes of the problem, including the conflicts of interest, are therefore clear. The solutions, however, appear less straightforward, so let us keep level-headed and find the right solution, being careful not to overreact with serious consequences.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, rating agencies have played an appalling role in the global financial crisis and in the euro difficulties and are far from deserving of praise. Lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, financing through contracting entities and the publication of ratings at questionable times with a procyclical effect, or shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, speak for themselves. Rating agencies have been, and continue to be, oblivious to this and do not see these problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">I personally have proposed that the EU should act now and I am pleased that you, too, feel the same. We should establish a European rating agency on the basis of a foundation model. Obviously, this foundation model must be financially independent. It must not be subject to any political interference, either from the European Central Bank, the Commission or any Member States. As an independent foundation, this European agency could become a serious competitor to the oligopoly, or indeed the monopoly, of the three rating agencies we are discussing now. It should be the case that any product offered in Europe and all issuers operating in Europe be required to give two ratings, one of which must come from this European agency.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to be independent, this foundation must also be financially independent. This means that we need seed-funding that could be provided by the European Investment Bank or perhaps the Commission, and from that point on, this European foundation would have to finance itself. The question of whether such financing should come from contracting authorities or users remains to be clarified. This was raised earlier on by Mr Giegold. We have to reach a decision on this as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">On a general note, we should also consider whether we could restrict our reliance on rating agencies somewhat because it seems to me that we are much too dependent on them at present.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the debate on rating agencies. We do need to look at the reliance on ratings and how to encourage more agencies so that there is more competition, as well as the issue of conflict of interest with respect to borrower-paid ratings. However, I would say that it has always been well known to every investor that this potential for conflict existed and that credit ratings are themselves not a recommendation to buy or sell.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also remember that, to achieve our 2020 goals, the EU needs investment and that needs market confidence, and rating agencies are a vital part of market confidence. When ratings work, they increase capital markets’ access for borrowers, lower interest rates and thus, for sovereign issuers, save taxpayers’ money. They also serve to give investors some guidance but, as I said, not buy and sell decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Please remember that in Europe, no AAA-rated sovereign or corporate issuer has ever defaulted. Even in this crisis, the level of AAA defaults in structured credits in Europe is less than 0.3%, which means that 99.9% of AAAs have not defaulted. We do need this investor confidence. We do need to look at our rating agencies, but please remember that they have not got everything wrong.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that credit rating agencies should be made more transparent and accountable, but I do not agree with all those who would like to limit their scope and functions. The failings of credit rating agencies in terms of forecasting risks and of warning the market about them are simply a reflection of the far more pronounced failings of the existing public financial institutions and authorities and of the banking system as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe in the free market and I believe that a greater degree of openness and competition is desirable in the credit rating sector too. However, the creation of a European public rating agency would be an oxymoron, a disgraceful, authoritarian venture designed to extend public control over the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">In short, it would be overly simplistic to restrict our analysis to the issue of credit rating agencies’ responsibility for the current financial crisis when the crisis is, above all, an economic one. The data and the policies adopted demonstrate how, in Europe and in many countries, there was a belief that we could substitute the real economy with finance, thus, in effect, abandoning the entire manufacturing sector.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, today’s debate on the framework for the supervision and operational control of credit rating agencies is, unfortunately, even more topical following yesterday’s decision by Moody’s to downgrade Greece’s credit rating by a full 4 points. Of course, this is not the first time over recent months that Greece’s credit rating has been seriously downgraded. However, yesterday’s downgrading is obviously provocative and unwarranted, given that it takes no account either of the progress made in applying the financial restructuring programme, which was welcomed by the representatives of the troika who have been in Athens since yesterday, or the creation of the Financial Stability Fund, or the fact that EUR 110 billion have been earmarked to finance the needs of the Greek economy.</p>
      <p sl="el">Does it make sense, at a time when the President of the European Central Bank, the head of the Deutsche Bank and the representative of the European Commission are congratulating the Greek Government on the implementation of the memorandum, thus helping the euro to recover against the dollar and the European money markets to recover, for Moody’s to downgrade Greece even further by making exactly the opposite assessment? I think this move clearly proves that there is a conflict of interests, given that it is not simply undermining Greece’s efforts at financial restructuring; it is also fuelling continuing speculative attacks by the markets on the Greek economy and on the euro area as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="el">This again confirms that these agencies issue ratings without ensuring that they are reliable and without any controls on the incentives for and results of their ratings, which raises serious issues of democracy and national and European sovereignty, given that we are talking about the evaluation of economies in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="el">One could cite numerous other examples. However, what we need to know is what we are doing to protect the European economies from the speculation caused by these dubious and non-transparent ratings. Immediate action is needed on two levels: the first is to take action to create a competitive European rating agency and the second is to set up a strict and reliable operating framework for these agencies, an operating framework that lays down transparent and uniform standards for rating criteria, for the time at which ratings are published, in conjunction with the resulting market reaction and, finally, for the evaluation of ratings over time in terms of their accuracy and reliability.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Against the general backdrop of the crisis, the crisis that has come about in the area of credit rating agency allocation reveals the dangers of this system. The most important thing is that no one feels responsible for the final result of risk assessment, although the activities of these agencies have a significant impact on the stability of the financial market, and very significant opportunities to obtain credit and the cost of credit depend on them. On the other hand, it is good that the Commission, understanding that we need to restore faith in the market and increase investor protection, is providing new EU-wide rules laying down general procedures for the regulation of credit rating agencies. The amendment of credit rating agency rules means better supervision at European Union level and greater transparency in this sector, but it is necessary to analyse this sector further and in more detail.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is necessary to ensure adequate credit rating agency controls and to issue appropriate penalties for infringements. Loans in rating agency activities must become more transparent so that investors and rating users are better protected and, most importantly, so that the credit rating sector becomes more competitive.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the incomprehensible decision by Moody yesterday clearly shows the dominance and power of rating agencies and the lack of transparency surrounding decision making. Every rating agency must be registered and their activities and the bases for their decisions scrutinised. We have to guarantee the independence of rating agencies and this means that we must not allow rating agencies to be financed by those whose credit worthiness is being checked.</p>
      <p sl="de">The incompatibilities and conflicts of interest must be eliminated: we cannot have credit agencies both providing consultancy to companies and rating them at the same time. Transparency is necessary, which means that models and the basis for valuation must be disclosed. We must counter monopolistic dominance with a second opinion and increased competition, which is why we also need agencies that are based in Europe. The foundation model has been proposed, but the limited company model could provide another alternative. In the autumn, the Kangaroo Group will be able to present the Commission’s proposal together with Mr Klinz.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The issue is that the activities of credit rating agencies not only led to the current financial crisis, but have also helped make it worse. The regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Credit Rating Agencies introduced in 2009 was devised as a response for regulating their activities. This regulation has introduced compulsory registration for all credit rating agencies doing business within the European Union and is focused on three main aspects: supervision, transparency and conflicts of interest.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, we are far from resolving the issue of transparency and that concerning the oligopolistic structure of the credit rating agency market. It is not normal for Member States’ economies and, by extension, their companies, to rely on the rating from just three agencies. Speculation about a country’s rating can push states which are somehow in a critical situation towards bankruptcy. In these circumstances, I think that an exclusive European credit rating agency needs to be created, which will provide real competition and an alternative instrument for existing companies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that it is downright absurd that two private US firms and one from the UK should be making decisions about the bankruptcies of EU Member States. In my opinion, this oligopoly of rating agencies is highly volatile. Another astounding thing is the times at which these agencies become active. The euro has scarcely begun to recover before someone is downgraded. All the talk about the awareness among these agencies of their responsibilities can be put into perspective when you consider the fact that the loans of unemployed US citizens packaged as securities were often awarded the triple A rating and were thus declared completely safe.</p>
      <p sl="de">On closer inspection, the apparent non-partisan position of the awarders of ratings has been exposed as fallacy, because they are getting paid by issuers of securities. The quality of the rating valuations is also doubtful. After all, before the international financial crisis, they gave the banks which would subsequently collapse the highest ratings.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore high time that rating agencies were kept in check. However, the enhanced supervision of rating agencies should not be limited to the EU level alone.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Against the backdrop of the current crisis, the activities of credit rating agencies are being subject to ever-mounting criticism due to the fact that they have failed to be objective in evaluating the level of credit risk for companies and even states. These agencies did not provide any early evaluations indicating the risk of a crisis, but have actually downgraded the rating for several European states, thereby exacerbating the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The major problem is the lack of competition on the credit rating services market because it is controlled by just three US companies. In this regard, I support the proposal from President Barroso to set up a European Credit Rating Agency. As you are all aware, one of the three agencies changed Germany’s credit rating last week on the back of an unacceptable error.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to end by saying that the European Union must ensure that the activities of credit rating agencies will be better regulated in future.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, I have been listening very carefully to this afternoon’s debate on rating agencies, and I am definitely no supporter of rating agencies, nor am I their advocate.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the other hand, I have no concerns whatsoever about some form of monopoly or oligopoly emerging among rating agencies. I have not heard a single speech here talking about how it could be possible that certain States where these enormous debts were incurred got into such a financial mess that there was no way out. I think it would be a very good thing to consider a system of state intervention in the running of the free market. Perhaps if we were to develop our ideas further in that direction, we would have fewer concerns over rating agencies.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate, which comes days after yet another downgrading of the Greek debt by a credit rating agency.</p>
      <p sl="it">The issues linked to the nature and the governance of these agencies, which have now become almost institutionalised on account of their importance in our economic system, are currently dominating political debate due to their role in the global financial crisis and in the current crisis in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="it">An economic system such as ours cannot function without independent bodies analysing public accounts and the accounts of private companies. The challenge lies in ensuring that these credit rating agencies carry out their activities transparently and in accordance with common standards, because an error on their part could actually cause a company to go bankrupt or could be a significant factor in the onset of a new crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that we absolutely must not nationalise credit rating agencies but rather seek to strike a balance between their independence and the need to guarantee an adequate level of accountability towards governments. Finding a balanced solution is therefore, in my view, the right way to ensure a better future, including in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, yesterday’s downgrading of Greece’s credit rating by Moody’s does indeed raise numerous questions, as other members have said.</p>
      <p sl="el">At this point, I should like to add an element, so that we can try to understand if the operating framework for these agencies is ultimately clean, if it is transparent and if it is formalised. Most action taken by private individuals against these specific agencies in the United States of America is unfounded, due to a 1933 law which stipulates that rating agencies are not liable for money lost as a result of erroneous ratings.</p>
      <p sl="el">Action by these specific agencies therefore tends to be uncontrolled. The game of speculation has no limits, it has no borders and the lack of a European legislative framework causes major ructions in the European Union and every country.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must understand that a free economy does not mean the law of the jungle, it does not mean unaccountability. Where this is not understood, we need to respond with our legislation; we need to impose it by law. You spoke, Mr President, of more competitive, more numerous agencies. We expect a great deal of the Commission in the immediate future.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-470" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am grateful to each and every one of you for the quality and the candour of your speeches. I shall not go back over the role of these agencies or the importance of the ratings that they issue; Mrs Comi gave a very good account of this just now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second preliminary remark, to echo the comments made just now by Mr Papanikolaou and Mr Strejček, is that we must improve the way in which these agencies operate. There has to be transparency – I will come back to this – and these ratings have to be as conclusive and as objective as possible. We shall achieve this, we must achieve this, but it does not mean that undertakings, especially financial undertakings, will not have to be managed properly, will not have to have both internal and external supervision systems, and crisis management tools – this also forms part of the proposals drawn up by the Commission – and it does not mean, either, that States will not have to govern themselves properly, will not have to manage their public finances properly and will not have to control their spending.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will now turn to credit rating agencies. We hope that the new proposed amendment to the regulation on these agencies will be adopted without delay so as to ensure their more effective monitoring by ESMA. She is no longer here, but, Mrs Le Pen, you should revise your information. Neither the Central Bank nor the Commission will supervise these agencies. We wanted more supervision and more transparency on the market, and it is only logical that the new independent authority, ESMA, should be the one to assume that role. As Mr Klinz put it so well, we need this transparency when we see what has been happening over the last few years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, as I said just now at the start of my speech, these proposals, together with the existing legislation – Mr Cutaş mentioned this legislation on credit rating agencies, which should be duly implemented between now and the end of the year, but which will only be fully applicable in December 2010 – do not address all of the issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Certain issues, for example, have not been thoroughly examined. Diversification, greater competition – Mrs Swinburne and Mr Scicluna referred to this need for a market of agencies that is not concentrated in the hands of a few people. Mr Giegold also spoke very clearly about the now widespread ‘issuer pays’ model: is it a healthy model? Is it sustainable? Mr Karas also raised this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must focus on this issue at the same time as evaluating the rules that appear in the new legislation, which is due to enter into force by December, since we have specifically targeted conflicts of interest in a bid to reduce them. Will this legislation be enough? We must, in any case, reflect on this issuer pays model mentioned by Mr Giegold.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third issue that we must address as part of our new efforts is European and national laws. Is it not the case that these laws are, as I believe, too reliant on the credit ratings of credit rating agencies? Lastly, Mrs Băsescu just raised the issue of the particular methodology for sovereign risk: here too, we must carry out some detailed work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to thank Mr Sánchez Presedo for supporting a swift agreement on the supervision package. This is one of the key aspects, in fact, since we need ESMA to supervise these agencies, and to do other things besides.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, we need a more structural response. That is why we are closely examining all the issues that I have just raised, and more specifically: independence, which Mrs Bowles was anxious to see, and I too want independence – by which I mean credibility – for these agencies; all the actors who are not performing well enough; the structures of the markets; and competition, including the idea – a legitimate one, in my view – of a European agency, in particular, for addressing the issue of sovereign risk, and perhaps other issues too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have not mentioned the status of that agency. Will it be a public agency, a private agency, a private-public partnership, or the interesting idea mentioned by Mr Klinz of a foundation? We are going to work on all these issues, too, over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of you, including Mrs Bowles, Mr Chountis just now, and Mrs Podimata a moment ago, mentioned the recent downgrading of the Greek rating. I, as Commissioner, am not going to start commenting in detail on each rating issued by a given rating agency. It would take up a great deal of time, and that is not our role; we should not be overdramatic when it comes to the credibility of ratings that have been, or are, issued.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That does not stop me, or my colleague and friend, Mr Rehn, who addressed you this morning, from saying that I was surprised – and Mr Mölzer also expressed his surprise – at the timing of this latest rating of Greece by one of the agencies yesterday. Ladies and gentlemen, we are very aware – and we must say so to the outside – that, as Mr Klute mentioned, Greece is currently making a huge effort to stabilise its public finances and to restore strong, healthy growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has complete confidence in this process, which is not easy but which is necessary and which must succeed. It is also important to point out that Greece is not alone. It has the benefit of European solidarity – this solidarity was shown at the highest level by the Heads of State or Government, by the Commission, by the Central Bank and by the International Monetary Fund a few weeks ago, and it will continue to make itself felt and to prove itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The various ratings, and all the attention focused on them, the disputes, too, over the methodologies and the timings: all of that encourages me in our work of reforming the agencies, work that we have begun, as I indicated in our communication of 2 June, and I would point out that we will be tabling some legislative proposals on these issues at the latest by the end of the year or at the start of next year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Mr Klute, you mentioned that, when we talk about all these issues, we are talking about more than just rating agencies. We must integrate this element, this tool that absolutely must be improved – more transparency, control, credibility and diversity – into an overarching structure that is one of intelligent regulation and effective supervision. These are the lessons from the crisis, which is not over, and we are going to learn from all these lessons. I reiterate, I repeat: not one actor, not one product, not one market, not one region must escape effective supervision and intelligent regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is this very agenda that was proposed by the Commission on 2 June, supported by the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg a few days ago, and supported too, I hope, and as President Barroso wants, by the European Council. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, you can count on me and on us to make proposals to you, one by one, step by step, between now and the start of next year, on all the undertakings we have made, so that we may learn, at European level and in good cooperation with the other regions of the world and, in particular, with the United States, every single lesson from this crisis affecting citizens, consumers and businesses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, if I take a little more than four minutes, I will make my concluding remarks shorter so that I do not overrun my six minutes.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Prospectus Directive was originally put together in 2003 with the condition that it be reviewed in September 2009. That has been the case. The Prospectus Directive concerns the completion, approval and publication of prospectuses as a prerequisite for the public offering of securities or their emission into a regulated market within the European Union. In general, the current review concerns technical aspects and is intended to eliminate legal uncertainties and unjustifiably onerous requirements.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. We have had very good cooperation, and that includes with the Commission. Without such good cooperation, we would not actually have been able to see this package through to a successful conclusion at first reading in less than ten months. I would now like to present briefly the agreement we have forged – and this includes the tripartite talks – in the form of eight principal points on which we were able to reach agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, one of our objectives was to facilitate access to capital in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises. You know that in the US, there is a much higher percentage of companies, including SMEs, that obtain finance through the market, whereas in Europe, the common practice, especially amongst small businesses, is to obtain finance through bank loans. What we want to do here is open up the opportunity for small businesses to use the market more often than before. We have therefore raised the threshold for exemption from the threshold requirements, which ultimately saddle SMEs with red tape and costs, from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns investor protection: we want to make sure that, in the course of such facilitation, we can provide sufficient safeguards to the small private investor. This is why we have raised the threshold for exemption from the prospectus requirements for securities denominated in 50 000 to a denomination of 100 000.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point I would like to raise concerns the issue of how to enable employees to participate in a company’s share capital without that company needing to bear the relatively high costs of launching a prospectus. So, this is about relaxing the prospectus requirement when offering employee participation programmes. Here, we have introduced a proportionality clause in that we have eliminated the unnecessary disclosure requirement. At the same time, however, we have made sure that we have a document detailing basic information so that those employees who benefit from this form of participation can have an idea about what it is they are getting. We have also made sure that companies listed in a third country, that is, a country outside the European Union, be exempted from the prospectus requirement as well – just like European companies – where they offer their employees shares, on the condition that they are able to prove equivalence with the disclosure requirements.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fourth area we discussed and on which we have reached agreement concerns what is commonly known as a ‘prospectus summary’. You can look at it this way: typically, a prospectus is a thick and voluminous document frequently containing several hundred pages. However, there is also the summary which frequently contains another 50, 60 or 70 pages. What we want Parliament to do is to shorten this to what is known as ‘key investor information’ or a document with essential information for investors of the kind provided by traditional investment funds, the UCITS. The Commission did not, in fact, consider this, wanting merely to ensure that key information really is contained in the summary.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have now agreed that, while keeping the summary in its present form, we should also ensure that it does indeed contain key information which will eventually be set out through directive requirements and a level 2 elaboration. This will help shorten the summary considerably, cutting it down from the current 60, 70 or 80 pages to some 20 or 30, perhaps, and help make it an easy read, especially for the small investor. This is important, because we do not want to leave the small investor out of the picture.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, the issue of liability: when a prospectus is drawn up, who is it that guarantees the accuracy of the contents? In particular, if an intermediary uses this prospectus, if he makes arbitrary changes to the contents, then the liable party is the intermediary. The prospectus requirement expires either when the offer period has expired or when the trading has begun, whichever is the later date.</p>
      <p sl="de">Seventhly, the review clause: as with the previous one, this directive will also be reviewed in five years’ time.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point is that, in this document, we have the first piece of legislation that has been brought into line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. Last but not least, allow me to point out that the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has managed to ensure that Parliament is given sufficient time. We have three months to respond to the Commission and another extension of three months, if necessary. Having said that, we have undertaken, in the event that all other options fail, to grant early approval, that is, to push this piece of legislation through within the shortest time.</p>
      <p sl="de">This satisfies all parties.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-475" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I had the honour of being heard by the European Parliament on 13 January, before being appointed as European Commissioner, I undertook to improve protection for investors and to reduce administrative costs to enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises which, as we know, account for 80-90% of the economic fabric within the single market. I am therefore delighted that Parliament has adopted this revised directive on prospectuses at first reading. This is a modified directive, which simplifies and clarifies the rules for issuing securities, which supports small and medium-sized enterprises, as Mr Klinz just very properly reminded us, in accessing the capital markets, and which will help to reinforce the internal capital market. Negotiations on this directive benefited from close collaboration with Parliament and even more than that, given that important improvements were proposed by Parliament and the Council and, obviously, the Commission played its part.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should therefore like, on behalf of the Commission, to extend my warmest thanks to your rapporteur, Mr Klinz, and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their efficient work and constructive cooperation. We are happy with this compromise text that we now have in our hands, which respects the spirit of the initial proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 2003 directive on prospectuses had very clear and undeniable merits. It laid down harmonised rules as to what European companies must publish when issuing securities, with one major innovation. Once a prospectus has been approved in one Member State, it is valid throughout the Union. However, the 2003 framework needed to be readjusted in order to improve the legal clarity and efficacy of the prospectus system and reduce administrative costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, henceforth, thanks to you and thanks to this review, certain types of security issues will be subject to reduced declaration obligations for small enterprises, for small lenders and for rights issues and government guarantees. The form and content of the prospectus summary will be improved. Exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus have been clarified in cases where companies sell via intermediaries or retail chains or allot shares to staff. Finally, declaration obligations that currently overlap with the requirements of the transparency directive will be repealed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here is the result of our joint work. This revised directive will therefore provide a balanced tool adapted to the complex questions raised by investors and issuers on the capital markets, be they small and medium-sized enterprises or large, well-established companies. The adoption of this text at first reading will send out a strong signal that the Union respects its undertaking to simplify and reduce the administrative burden, while at the same time maintaining and even improving the level of protection for investors. That is why I should like once again to thank your rapporteur and to thank you for approving this dynamic compromise in favour of this simplification and, in particular, in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would like to begin by mentioning the good work that has been possible within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, thanks to proposals by its various members, and to highlight the role that the rapporteur, our colleague, Mr Klinz, played in bringing about a positive result. When we speak of prospectuses we are, of course, speaking about the idea of publicity, market security and better access to investment. For this very reason, I have sometimes felt that there is a distinct conflict between the protection which consumers need and the protection of investors, which is also necessary.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We were able to find a balance. Often, the solutions were not identical, but more importantly, it is worth emphasising that in the end, this review paid attention to the situation of small and medium-sized businesses, the need to respect small investors regarding the possibility of greater simplification, greater clarity on exemptions and lower costs for businesses by reducing what is often an excessive administrative burden.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Obviously, the respective positions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament are often not exactly the same in trialogue. However, it was possible to reach a balance on the future of market security at EU level, and I would like to stress here that this is a positive thing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadows for their cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the compromises reached are accepted by the S&amp;D Group as they are fair and we believe will lead to greater investor protection, in particular, for small retail investors. I think, as the Commissioner said, it is in the spirit of the original directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we look at the summary and the key information document – Dr Klinz has spoken about that and the need to have clarity – I think we have reached a wording which will ensure clarity, whilst being clear that civil liability remains with the base prospectus.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we have clarified the period when publication of a prospectus or supplementary information to it is required; we have also clarified the requirement for and liabilities of the prospectus when securities are sold via intermediaries and not directly by the issuer.</p>
      <p sl="en">On threshold: I would say it was more a tweaking exercise than dramatic change, but the compromises reached were fair and balanced and the S&amp;D Group supports these.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is a welcome step to be clear about the definition of a qualified investor as is the effect of supervision of third country trading.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with better regulation, the decision that no prospectus will be required for employee share schemes would appear to be sensible. After all, if employees are not willing to invest in their own firm, maybe the management should take heed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The work on delegated acts – Dr Klinz has mentioned this. The three months compromise is vitally important and is a move in Parliament’s direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will certainly be using the prospectus directive decision as a benchmark for the work I will be doing as the rapporteur on construction products, while the benchmark that is being used by the Council is the Pets Directive rather than the Prospectus Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the electronic publication of the prospectus: I think that is welcome too. The review clause of five years is also welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">So all in all, Mr President and rapporteur, the S&amp;D Group supports the compromise reached and we look forward to supporting the first reading deal in tomorrow’s vote.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, in the wake of the financial crisis, justified demands are being made for greater transparency and better regulation of the financial market. I have no problem with this, but, as always when new regulations are to be introduced, it must be done in a balanced way. The capacity of the European economy for growth will not be increased by ill-thought-out proposals, even if they have legitimate purposes.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, my colleague, Dr Klinz, for his excellent work, which takes a stand against these excessively detailed rules and regulations. His proposal increases legal certainty and removes unjustifiably stringent requirements in order to reduce companies’ administrative burdens by 25% by 2012. My group and I are, of course, happy with the compromise that has been negotiated by Dr Klinz and others. The proposal reduces the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, but – and I think it is important to say this – it does this without reducing investor protection. This is also something that Mr Barnier mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The discussion has, of course, centred on the thresholds that are to be applied on publication of prospectuses, in connection with rights issues, for example. I think they are well-balanced and will enable the internal market to function better. The proposal will, of course, mean that small and medium-sized enterprises will not need to produce a prospectus and it will therefore be easier for them to attract capital. The threshold is being raised from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million. This is a well-balanced proposal. It will also make it easier for regional banks to take out bonds, as the thresholds are being raised from EUR 50 million to EUR 75 million for non-equity securities, such as interest-bearing debt and structured products.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Overall, like my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to thank Dr Klinz for a truly excellent piece of work. This report is an important step towards improving conditions for millions of small businesses in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I know that this is not one of our most headline-grabbing reports, but it deserves to be, because this Prospectus Directive has actually been crucial to regulating European firms’ access to capital. That, in itself, is vital for Europe’s potential for economic growth in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been a delight to work with the shadow rapporteurs but most delightful under Mr Klinz’s guidance. He has added real value to the original Commission proposal and the Council’s position. I believe the resulting text is not only technically workable, but is a good balance between investor protection and easing the access to capital markets for enterprises in Europe. We have worked hard to get legal certainty and there is a clear process for updating and supplementing prospectuses. We have tried to help investors with the contents of the summary and the concept of key information.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly pleased that there will be a lighter disclosure regime for rights issues. I think that this will help not only larger companies, but smaller ones too. At a time when markets are volatile, it can be the cost of a prospectus that would put someone off even trying to raise additional capital. We do need to especially bear that in mind at this moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a very welcome precedent. I look forward to further analysis of the sector when we look at the MiFID Directive later on this year. As I said, this is an example of a concrete measure we are taking to improve Europe’s environment for entrepreneurs and for investing in our future.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, we know a number of things. We know that this crisis has been like a mutating virus: it began as a property crisis, later becoming a banking crisis, then an economic crisis, and ended up as a sovereign debt crisis that could bring other crises in the sector in its wake.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also know that this crisis has been very expensive. According to your services, aid commitments to the financial sector total EUR 3.5 billion: in other words, one third of the EU’s gross domestic product. We also know that one of the root causes of the crisis was the lack of transparency in products, institutions and markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why the report that we are discussing at the moment is so important. However, if you want a statistic, I would remind you that in the United States alone, in the years 2000-2006, asset-backed securities increased by a factor of four and mortgage-backed securities by a factor of seven; moreover, in a very recent court appearance, the advisors of a reputable bank said that they did not have a very good idea of what they were selling.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also know – and this is the third statement – that many of the commitments that we made at the G20 have not gone, to quote a Spanish poet, ‘from the Muses to the theatre’ – they have not gone from imagination to the written word.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also know that throughout this remodelling of the financial sector, there are three principles which I see as key: Pan-European entities must be supervised by pan-European authorities; we must have the necessary measures at our disposal to detect the virus and avoid infection; and, finally, we must prevent the public from having to pay by itself for those infections that it has not caused.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, you have a major job to do if we do not want the next crisis to catch us with our pants down.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will end by saying in French that I recommend ‘de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace ’ in your mission – boldness, more boldness and forever boldness.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Abolishing the double transparency obligations and reducing the disclosure requirements for companies with reduced market capitalisation will generate estimated overall savings of EUR 110 million per year. The review of the Prospectus Directive will therefore help boost the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses in the European Union. We must not forget that small and medium-sized companies are the driving force of the European Union’s economy. They created 9.4 million jobs in the European Union between 2002 and 2008 and currently provide jobs for 90 million European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, financial transparency requirements need to be harmonised at European Union level in order to reduce the administrative burden on European companies. As a result, the newly created European Securities and Markets Authority will have to monitor the harmonisation of Member States’ legislations with regard to examining and approving prospectuses.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have seen a great deal of turbulence in the European markets in the last number of years, with many having suffered great losses. So, we must ensure that investors, especially retail investors, receive adequate protection within the European Union. Investors should be able to gain the information necessary to make informed decisions. Having a well-structured framework in place also makes the European market more secure and, therefore, attractive to serious investors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Prospective Directive has been fundamental in setting industry standards across the European Union, as has been the case with the UCITS Directive. Technical legislation that regulates this dynamic industry should frequently be reviewed, fine tuned and updated so as to ensure that it remains relevant and current. I agree that certain provisions within the directive were unnecessary and a number of obligations to which organisations must comply should be removed. The benefits that they give to the investor are negligible, while they place a significant burden on the business itself. The streamlining of definitions to avoid problems of interpretation in different Member States will also further streamline the sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his excellent work. I would also like to congratulate all the shadow rapporteurs. I believe that this report is well-balanced and proportionate.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, I think the report on the amendment to the Prospectus Directive is a positive one because many of these amendments reduce the administrative burden of companies, so the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have together done an excellent job.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As a counterweight to reducing the requirements of a prospectus, we must always take into account the matter of the investor’s protection. The legal basis for the prospectus summary was clarified and the idea of a broad legal basis was dropped, which is good, because a long prospectus summary would have been difficult to understand, and the investor might have had the feeling that there was no need to read carefully though the actual prospectus itself. Now the prospectus summary must simply correspond to the summary; there cannot be a contradiction between the two. The actual legal responsibility lies with the truthfulness of the information in the prospectus proper. I also applaud the move that the requirements concerning the content of the prospectus are to be clarified, as having a uniform structure can only serve to promote the comprehensibility of these summaries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the second amendment that I tabled, I wanted to ensure that the prospectus requirement remained in place in the case of staff placements. This was based on the notion that all investors should be treated equally. It cannot always be assumed consistently that a small investor on the staff knows enough about the company and its securities. This is perhaps something we should return to and consider in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This directive has an important purpose: that an investor can base his or her investment decisions on clear and comprehensible information that is easily accessible. I believe that amending the directive, despite the problem I mentioned, will bring its own contribution, with a change in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to congratulate Mr Klinz for his exceptional efforts on this report and make the following clarifications. The Commission’s proposal for simplifying and improving the Prospectus Directive provides a better level of protection to investors, giving them sufficient, suitable information. The unique passport is valid in any European Union market, once it has been registered and approved by the relevant authorities in a Member State.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With a view to cutting red tape, I think that an appropriate legal framework is required to remove the uncertainty regarding host Member State notification. In addition, by getting rid of superfluous tasks which impact on companies, we can achieve a reduction of 25% in the unjustifiably high costs involved and in the administrative burden by 2012. Finally, I wish to say that the new regulations will provide better protection for investors, offering them the chance to carry out a better analysis of the risks associated with a security prior to making an investment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, clear regulation of the liability issue is obviously part and parcel of a transparent securities market. In this respect, we must first and foremost pay attention to protecting the small investor. When it comes to the resale of securities, the investor needs to know who to hold accountable for the accuracy and currency of information. If we regard the investor as a consumer who is worth protecting, then it is vital that he or she is given access to the essential information needed in order to price the product, in this case, securities. Only then will he or she be able to make informed decisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Equally, in the EU’s common capital market, it is important that we draw up a comparative list of differences between liability regulations of national civil law. In these times of crisis and uncertainty in particular, what this means is re-establishing for the investor a real sense of confidence through corresponding transparency in the securities market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prospectus regulates the public offering of securities and their emission into a regulated market in the Community. It is a sort of passport which allows access to all EU markets.

I see improvement of access to securities for small and medium-sized enterprises through the elimination of administrative hurdles as an investment in the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, may I once again thank each and every speaker for their approval and additional remarks. Clearly, the text that will be passed is a dynamic compromise. As such, it cannot include every idea and every suggestion made but, at the same time, I think that Parliament, Mr Klinz, your committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs and others have good reason to be satisfied, because the current text has benefited greatly – and I speak as I find – from your comments, proposals and constructive criticism throughout the process of negotiation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A large number of amendments that you introduced, together with other colleagues from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, have been integrated into the text; especially, and I repeat, ladies and gentlemen, regarding the scope of the directive, provision on key information to be included in the prospectus summary, the regime applicable to employees or even the ‘lisbonisation’ – to coin a phrase – of the Prospectus Directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Feio mentioned the conflict between protection for investors and the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. May I remind him that a proportionate prospectus will be developed for small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Cutaş also raised this commitment, this particular treatment for small and medium-sized enterprises. A proportionate prospectus will therefore be developed, Mr Feio, for small and medium-sized enterprises, a level 2 prospectus, but which respects the need for investors to be protected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another point which Mrs Essayah raised just now was qualified investors and the treatment of private individuals. The directive takes full account of the difference between the two. I would remind you that the summary will be instrumental in safeguarding proper and fair protection for private individuals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is able to accept all the amendments and therefore supports the text, as do – I have noted – Mr Klinz, the various speakers from the groups, Mr Feio, Mrs Stihler, Mr Schmidt and Mrs Ford, who approved this excellent compromise on behalf of their groups. We are certain that this directive will make a difference in strengthening protection for investors and reducing the administrative costs for issuers, that it will make an even bigger contribution towards developing a real capital market in the European Union. We must not miss this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to finish by thanking Mr García-Margallo for his contribution because, over and above this text, which marks real progress, he has set this progress in a much more general context, on which, moreover, he is working very efficiently in the supervision package, the transparency package under discussion. May I remind you that this review will improve the elements of transparency and adapt it to issuers, especially small and medium-sized enterprise, while at the same time – I repeat – respecting protection for investors. The element of supervision was included in the supervision package, the omnibus text, and it is that text that Mr García-Margallo is working on, with other colleagues, while calling on us to demonstrate collective boldness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have demonstrated that in this text, which marks real progress, and I trust that, all together, we shall prove that, with the Council, in compromises that are just as dynamic, compromises that we shall need to find over coming days on other texts currently under discussion, on the regulation on hedge funds and private equity and, above all, on the major European supervision project that we need for this text, on the credit rating agencies we were talking about earlier and on numerous other questions of regulation, transparency and control, which are the lesson that we must learn from the crisis.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets we are putting to the Commission and the Council these oral questions concerning the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework at a time of incredible economic and EU policy challenges and at a time when questions are also being asked about the sustainability of the European Union project. We are tabling these oral questions because they are linked to the joint statements and promises made in May 2006 as part of the interinstitutional budget agreement, which no longer appear to apply. That, at least, is our impression.</p>
      <p sl="de">On top of this, there is the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, with new priorities for foreign trade, sport, space research, climate change and energy, to name but a few. That means that we also have to find room in our budget for these new priorities. Article 311 states explicitly that the Union must provide itself with the means necessary to achieve its objectives and carry through its policies without taking on debt.</p>
      <p sl="de">You could say that the Statement on the Budget Review of 17 May 2006 contains everything that is necessary for a thorough review of the decisions made then and for their revision, if necessary, as well as an express assurance of the involvement and participation of Parliament in the opinion forming process associated with that.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the rapporteur in charge of this issue at the time, with disappointment, I have to ask the question today whether these agreements and commitments were genuine or whether they were just a sham from the very start, a sham that was needed simply to achieve an agreement in the Council. Commissioner Lewandowski, is the Commission hesitating with the analysis and proposals envisaged just because the Council does not want to budge on this? You need to decide whether you want to side with the Council or with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">To this I would add that Article 4 of the interinstitutional agreement makes it expressly clear that, in the case of any review of the treaty that has budgetary implications, the Multiannual Finance Framework and the interinstitutional agreement would need to be revised accordingly. It is these commitments, starting with the European External Action Service, and the aforementioned priorities that are making revision necessary, not only that of a technical nature but, most definitely, also the political revision of Budget IIV and the Multiannual Financial Framework. While they will not all need to be carried out in the first year, they will most certainly affect multiannual planning.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this juncture, I would add that we are affronted by the decision that was hastily made during the Stabilisation Rescue Package, although it was, of course, necessary and there was no alternative but, at the same time, it has, to some extent, ridden roughshod over the rights of Parliament in budgetary matters. The Commission should consider whether it should make use of Article 124, that is, whether it should take the initiative to arrange regular meetings at the highest level, the level of presidents of the institutions, as part of the budgetary procedure, in order to finally move these delicate issues forward. This is because we should also, hopefully in time for or during conciliation, talk about the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework – Article 312 concerning the Approval Procedure – and the political revision of Budget IIV, also from the perspective of political necessity, about making adjustments in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, about the margins, the reviews, flexibilities, political projects of the future, such as Galileo and ITER, and the European External Action Service, in order to define projects with European added value and, where possible, to exercise restraint of course.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking here today, I have to ask both the Commission and the Council very seriously if they think that all these agreements should now be regarded as dead letters. Or are you genuinely prepared to consult Parliament? It is in the interests of the Treaty of Lisbon that we take all necessary measures during the financial framework adoption procedure to facilitate adoption of this act. I have not seen any signs of this to date, which is why I need to ask you the following question: are you prepared and do you consider yourself able to revise the Multiannual Financial Framework while, at the same time, working with us, reconciling it with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon? Your replies, both those of the Commission and the Council, will decide our future cooperation on budgetary matters in the next few years.</p>

    <intervention id="2-494" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Luis Espadas Moncalvillo" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Good afternoon. My thanks to the Members of the European Parliament for the opportunity to answer your questions on this issue, which is so important.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must start by stressing that there was no agreement at the European Council of December 2005 that the Multiannual Financial Framework should be revised. Rather, the Commission was asked to carry out a full and in-depth examination of all the components of the European Union’s expenditure and resources, and then submit a report on that. The European Council also established that decisions on all aspects of the report could be taken on the basis of the report itself, and that it would be taken into account for the purposes of the preparatory studies for the subsequent financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">As yet, the Commission has still not presented this examination. The Council does not believe that there is currently an enormous or great need to revise the current Multiannual Financial Framework; this is, above all, because of the need to consider the budgetary and macro-economic situation through which the Member States are currently struggling. The position adopted by the Council is therefore that any new need must be financed by prioritising or redistributing the credits that are currently awarded. In any case, any decision to revise the Multiannual Financial Framework requires a Commission proposal and this proposal has not been received.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, it is clear that, if a decision to revise the financial framework had to be adopted, it would – obviously – have to be done with respect for the treaty, including Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Council’s position, included in its budgetary guidelines for 2011, which were adopted on 16 March and presented to Parliament during the tripartite dialogue held on 25 March of this year. Specifically, the Council agrees with the Commission that the Lisbon legislative package must constitute a technical exercise and cannot mean a modification of the content of the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management of 17 May 2006.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must stress the importance of adopting the Lisbon legislative package as soon as possible so that the new requirements established by the new treaty can be transposed to legislation without excessive delays. As part of this process, the Council is prepared to enter discussions with the European Parliament on the Lisbon legislative package.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity offered by the question to give the position of the Council on this issue, and I will be delighted to answer any other questions that Members consider it appropriate to ask.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will start directly with serious answers to the questions, as, if Reimer Böge is asking the questions, that is sufficient reason to take them seriously.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the question on the revision of the financial framework, the report on the functioning of the interinstitutional agreement is now in your hands. This analyses the flexibility and the margins – not as a goal in itself, but in the context of possible new developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The conclusion is very clear that the margins are very tight in almost all the headings. We cannot expect, for example, Heading 2 (Agriculture) to supply additional needs whenever there are new needs to be financed. The Commission can only present proposals for the revision of the financial framework when the precise needs are known and cannot be covered by other means, which is not the case so far. Even with ITER, we need commitment for the long-term financing of this large-scale project.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the lines identified as conducive to the 2020 strategy for green, smart and inclusive growth, we have identified around EUR 58 billion in the 2011 draft budget, which is 40% of the budget conducive to these goals listed in the 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moving on to the second question about the procedure, the Commission’s basic logic was to align the provisions of the current interinstitutional framework with the new framework of the Lisbon Treaty. The goal was to preserve as much continuity as possible and make as little change as is needed by the new treaty, but on the basic assumption of preserving the same level of flexibility and the same balance of powers between institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know what is pending given our assumptions. The pending issue is the so-called ‘zero zero free flexibility’ that has been conducive to conciliation since 2007. Everybody who was part of the conciliation is aware that this was necessary and that is why we should defend it. This was the provision about the Council acting by qualified majority to compensate and revise, which has been done on several occasions since 2007. I think there is nothing in the letter and spirit of the new treaty to contradict that level of flexibility, and we are going to be very flexible when it comes to the new innovative drafting of this flexibility article in the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new budgetary review that is delayed should be the occasion to rise up to the political vision for the future, as clearly stated by Reimer Böge. This is the vocation, not the report on interinstitutional agreement, so we hope to be up to the expectations of Parliament and are, as usual, ready to cooperate.</p>

Anyone who would like to have a photo of me is welcome to have it. I will be happy to send them a photo by PDF or e-mail. However, when I am sitting here alongside a member of the Martin List, I do find it immature when photos are secretly being taken from behind to document that fact. Madam President, I ask that you rectify this in future as it is unbecoming for this House and I ask that you pass on this concern of mine.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As Mr Böge said, the Treaty of Lisbon commits the European Union to new priorities. It is therefore necessary to secure the finances required to achieve the objectives and implement the EU’s policies in this context. This situation obviously requires a wide-ranging review, which will include every aspect relating to the European Union’s spending and funding, including technical and political adjustments to the Multiannual Financial Framework and the interinstitutional agreement, as well as the revision of certain budgetary envelopes agreed up until 2013.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, we must not overlook the fact that we are in the midst of an economic crisis and that we must use every resource available to us to overcome this crisis. Apart from the wide-ranging review, which needs to be carried out prudently and in detail, I think that a pragmatic approach is also required to facilitate the tasks ahead of us and help us emerge from this period more quickly. As the Presidency of the Council said, I think that any money which has not been spent so far should be reallocated to areas promoting job creation and helping to overcome the crisis. Additional funds are not required; the only thing needed is to reallocate funds which have not been used.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Within the European programmes, Member States must be provided with the opportunity to transfer funds from areas where there is insufficient demand to areas where applications have exceeded the resources allocated. In addition, there are various initiatives which have been approved after 2007, such as the Eastern Partnership or the future Danube Strategy. Reallocating funds to these instruments would make a considerable contribution, along with the contribution of each Member State involved, to launching and implementing projects of paramount importance to the states located in the region, but not only them.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the debates we have been attending in the European Parliament in recent months have been of great importance.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are setting out nothing more and nothing less than the future of the European Union. For example, we are debating the Europe 2020 strategy to prevent us from falling behind in terms of research, development and innovation, job creation, world competitiveness, and the environment. I would like to know if the Commission and the Council believe that these goals can be achieved without substantially increasing the EU budget, or if we are instead going to once again go no further than making declarations that sound good.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nor can we forget – and we have already recalled it here – that the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force a few months ago and that, as a result of it, the European External Action Service has been launched, which also has a financial cost; I would like to know how we are going to finance it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will give you an example of what I believe we must not do and what I have unfortunately heard here. For example, the Commission has just presented an amending budget to compensate banana-supplying African, Caribbean and Pacific states with EUR 190 million over four years. Do you really believe that meeting this commitment should be at the expense of other types of aid to third countries? Are we really going to finance new commitments by cutting ones that we had previously made?</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the needs are clear and the answers should be so. Nevertheless, just in case, I am going to recall what the Council said when it adopted the current financial framework, and I am citing the actual text: ‘The increasing pace of globalisation and rapid technological change continues to offer new opportunities and present new challenges. Against this background, the European Council agrees that the EU should carry out a comprehensive reassessment of the financial framework, covering both revenue and expenditure, to sustain modernisation and to enhance it, on an ongoing basis. The European Council therefore invites the Commission to undertake a full, wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP, and of resources, including the UK rebate, to report in 2008/9’.</p>
      <p sl="es">Well, here we are in mid-2010 and Parliament is having to ask the other two institutions an oral question in order to find out whether or not they are going to meet the commitment that they should have met last year.</p>
      <p sl="es">It has already been said and could, in a way, be right: we are in a difficult economic situation; we are in an economic crisis in which the majority of countries are cutting their budgets, and it will be thought of as preposterous to ask for more money for the European Union. However, I would like to say two things to you about that.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, these cuts that EU Member States are making are being made in order to cut the deficit and the budgets of the European Parliament and the EU are not in deficit. In fact, they are not in deficit because this is a requirement of the treaties.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, and much more importantly, if we really believe in the European project and if we want to carry on being relevant, we must react now. There will be winners and losers and if we do not want to belong to the losers’ group, we must set out a clear and ambitious strategy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that this does not get stuck as a declaration of intentions, because we cannot let ourselves allow that.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to start by reminding the Council that it was the one that suggested we have this mid-term review. It was the Council that demanded that mid-way through the period, we should see whether the funds could potentially be used elsewhere, whether we could revise how the funds are used. Now the Council is saying that it would rather not talk about this. The ball is in the Commission’s court. The Commission claims that it has, of course, looked at the funds and at how much flexibility there is. I would like to thank Mr Lewandowski, because we have an excellent report that shows that, on the whole, there is no flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="da">We therefore need to get our act together and consider what options are available. We need to consider not only how much flexibility we have but also whether there are any programmes that are not working. Are there any opportunities for making savings? That was presumably also one of the Council’s intentions. Is it possible to re-prioritise some things? We are, of course, thinking not only in terms of spending more money but also of possibly being able to spend the money in a better way. That could also be a possibility. Should we not open up this debate? The problems will not necessarily solve themselves if we do not talk about them. It might be a good idea to get started on this debate.</p>
      <p sl="da">I have been surprised by the Member States’ willingness recently to contribute outside the EU budget. I visited the Community Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo. There, they have chartered a boat to carry out fisheries control, and this is very much needed. The Member States are happy to pay for this outside the budget. Let me tell you, it will involve a lot of bureaucracy for such a small agency to collect money from 27 Member States. It is therefore not the right way to go. We need to get our heads out of the sand. We need to have an honest debate on this issue and see how we can solve the problems.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, Mr Espadas Moncalvillo, I am disappointed both by today’s reply from the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council and that of Commissioner Lewandowski.</p>
      <p sl="de">What you are doing here is passing the buck. Mr Espadas Moncalvillo says: yes, we need the Commission to draw up something. Then, Commissioner Lewandowski quite rightly says: we need a political vision for the future of the European Union, and yet he does not tell us what that might look like. Today, he simply said again: yes, we have to talk about it and we will submit a paper. Commission and Council, you have had many years to make progress on this political initiative. May I remind you that, in 2006, when the majority of the European Parliament voted through the current financial perspective, that was on the condition that there would be a mid-term review and that all income and expenditure would be put to the test. Austrian Chancellor Schüssel said on that occasion: ‘If we do not come up with a new system, we will be at each other’s throats when the next financial perspective comes along’. We have to stop the UK rebate and we really have to know where we stand in terms of our political objectives, but obviously we also need to agree a budget. So far, this action has failed to materialise and I regret that deeply. What we really need is a debate about the sources of finance for the European budget. Do we not, for example, need the CO2 tax and the financial transaction tax, precisely so that we can prevent the new tax burden falling on our citizens, while setting up a transparent basis for the European budget?</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of income, everyone is saying that we cannot simply blunder on with our agricultural policy, especially after the health check study, and that it must be more environmentally friendly and more sustainable. No proposals for this have been mentioned as yet. In terms of the structural funds, if we are talking about climate policy, then it is patently clear that we have to change our structural policy, too, and that it has to become more sustainable, if we are seriously to take on our common climate change objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the case, too, with all our education policy objectives, which means the Europe 2020 strategy. Or, consider our research policy: if we want to encourage our European talent in a different way and invest more in intelligence and education, then that needs to be reflected in the next financial perspective. Likewise, if we want to play a responsible role in foreign policy and crisis prevention, that too needs to be reflected in the European budget. While we are now all aware that Member States are responsible for reducing their debt, we must have a European understanding for our common global interests in the world, and that must be reflected in our next financial perspective. We should not waste any more time because we have already wasted years on the old structures. For that reason, we urgently need to get this review under way so that we really can identify new priorities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The budget perspective for 2007-2013 adopted by the European Parliament in 2006 is, without doubt, a success of the entire Union. I say success, because a financial framework established for six years is another step towards ever greater integration of individual Member States. I do not need to remind everyone of the importance of cohesion policy – especially as concerns the European Union’s internal affairs – which, in large measure, is helping to raise the standard of living, especially in the 12 recently accepted Member States. Of course, we must not forget, either, the funds designated for developing the competitiveness of the European economy or the financial resources being given to farmers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Recently, more and more is being said about assigning greater resources to, among others, boosting innovation and the development of green technologies. Undoubtedly, these are important questions for the Union’s economy, particularly during the crisis. However, such announcements are causing the greatest anxiety in countries such as Poland, because there is a real danger that the resources available for cohesion policy will be reduced, whereas cohesion policy is, in principle, one of the foundations of the European Union. Therefore, we should do everything to make sure that Union policy does not lose its most important feature.</p>
      <p sl="pl">While respecting and understanding the differences between regions, we must strive with might and main for the elimination of negative contrasts and gross social disproportions. Only a Europe of equal opportunities will be respected in the international arena and become a significant partner for the most important political and economic powers of today’s world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, I have a question: is it possible that a review of the Multiannual Financial Framework influenced by current financial and economic problems might seek to breach one of the fundamental principles of European solidarity and hit Member States whose presence in Union structures has been the shortest?</p>

      <p sl="en">The President of the European Commission has dramatically announced that democracy could disappear in Greece, Spain and Portugal unless urgent action is taken to tackle the debt crisis. Does anybody think that these countries are in a position to finance an increase in the EU budget? Does anybody think that the rest of the Member States are in a position to bail out these countries and, additionally, to finance an increase in the EU budget? The answer to both questions is ‘no’. Some difficult choices will have to be made at this point to allow a reduction in the EU budget. It is now time to get rid of programmes that have not proved efficient, of which we have many in the present EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, a while ago, I put written questions to the Council and the Commission on the Regulation and the Multiannual Financial Framework. These concerned, in particular, the proposed Article 8(3) of this regulation, and the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 6 May 2008 in Case C-133/06. The Council said it was still dealing with the regulation, and so I should like to know whether it has now adopted a position on Article 8(3).</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission, on the other hand, says that the regulation, and therefore Article 8(3), does not have a second legal basis, and refers in this connection to Article 312 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Could the Commission elaborate on this point? After all, it has not yet managed to convince me. As far as I am concerned, there is manifestly a second legal basis, as no mention is made of unanimity in the Council, which is required under Article 312(2). As I see it, therefore, an illegal decision-making process is being created that was forbidden by the Court in the judgment mentioned earlier. In addition, I should like to emphasise that the passerelle clause of Article 312(2) was, in any case, blocked by the Dutch Parliament in November 2009 and cannot be an option.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I welcome the Council and the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are going to change the focus. In the draft budget for 2011, the 2020 strategy talks about EUR 58 billion, or some 40%, to finance seven flagships, as the Commission calls them. However, in the draft budget for 2011, it talks about 85% on cohesion and natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, in the 2020 strategy, expressed in terms of the draft budget for 2011, at no point does the Commission include the word ‘cohesion’ or the word ‘agriculture’. This means that there will be grey areas and overlaps in the budget, because I am sure that everyone thinks that cohesion and agricultural policy should be included in the 2020 strategy. This will involve tensions between the Member States and will involve, as it has done up to now, unofficial proposals that appear suddenly, are criticised, and are then hidden away and not mentioned again.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, the Council has also made new commitments outside of the current Multiannual Financial Framework, such as the ‘Food facility’, Galileo, the economic recovery programme, the international thermonuclear experimental reactor, financial supervision, and the financial stabilisation plan, that are taking us a long way away from the Multiannual Financial Framework that we adopted in December 2005.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need clarification to know, first, if it will be possible to finance all these flagships without damaging agricultural and cohesion policy, and whether we will have to face cuts to traditional policies to finance the new priorities with which the Council is presenting us. The special committee for the next Multiannual Financial Framework will start work this July.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, we need this review that – as I say to a fellow Member who has now left the room – does not necessarily involve increasing the necessary resources, but possibly reorganising them. Commissioner, we need this revision precisely in order to be able to put this special committee in place at the same time as preparing this financial review.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic, social and financial crisis of the last few months and years, the new Treaty of Lisbon with its new powers, and the challenge we have set ourselves with Europe 2020, require the mobilisation of massive new financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">The paradox we are witnessing, including in this debate, is that right now, both the Commission and the Council appear to be silent and incapable of deciding and making choices. However, we know that if we want to come out of this difficult economic and social phase, if we want to address the major issues of the environment, the development of cohesion policy and agriculture in the coming years, then we need to invest more heavily in Europe and Europe’s function, and hence its essential function, which is to say, its budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">To do so, we must not be afraid to discuss, even at a time of budgetary restrictions, the idea of investing more heavily in resources and to have the strength and ability to develop debate and discussion that tackle the issue of increasing resources and that of more effective and flexible use of resources.

It is a few years too late and, because of this delay, the European Commission is, of course, getting caught up by one political reality after another. These changes which were ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon must obviously now also be viewed in the light of the financial and economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">When the Commissioner repeatedly says that we should now set ourselves political goals and priorities, I can tell him what, in my view, our priority should be: it lies in saving, specifically saving on administrative expenditure under heading 5.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a situation where we do not know the exact scale of the European Union’s administrative expenditure. The administrative expenditure of EU agencies, the decentralised agencies, is not covered by heading 5.

      <p sl="pt">In the resolution on the budget for the current year, Parliament approved the possibility of extending the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2007-2013 to 2015-2016. We are all aware that in seeking to control the deficit and reduce public debt, the Member States are cutting back on investment. This means that the implementation of EU funds will be further delayed. However, these resources are vital for social, economic and territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Are the Commission and the Council therefore willing, like Parliament, to extend the Multiannual Financial Framework to 2015-2016? The challenges posed by globalisation, the ageing population and climate change have to be overcome. With the implementation of the 2020 strategy, I am sure that we will make the right choice and defend employment, quality of life and our social model. However, if we are to cope with these investments, how can we increase the European Union’s budget? In 2009, the surplus was more than EUR 2.2 billion. Are the Commission and the Council willing for these surplus funds from the EU budget to be used to strengthen the following year’s budget or to constitute a fund to finance the EU’s priorities?</p>
      <p sl="pt">How would they proceed in relation to Parliament concerning the establishment of EU priorities? They advocate a clear escalation of EU priorities so that we can decide, in a transparent and consensual manner, what we want to support, in a concrete form and with financial support, and what we are supporting from a strictly political point of view, but will this have any impact on the budget?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that the European budget, which should be a symbol of solidarity and the will to act together, has become a rigid tool, which the citizens do not understand and which lags behind the expectations of European society, incapable of being deployed to fight the social repercussions of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From this point of view, not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking politician talking about the need for a stronger European budget. Tension is increasing between revenue that is too modest, too dependent on the contributions of the Member States, and the money that the Union needs to spend in order to kick-start growth. For example, in the draft budget for 2011, the Commission simply presents a margin for manoeuvre of EUR 50 million to support new projects linked to employment and corporate competitiveness, which are top priorities. The revision of the financial framework is therefore a serious challenge for the future of the Union if we want to make it a real political and economic leader and also, and above all, a player that is closer to its citizens at a time when nearly 25 million of them are affected by unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the debate further to Mr Böge’s question has not actually borne a great deal of fruit. The envisaged mid-term review has failed to materialise and, in addition, what is now being promised is extremely meagre. Against that background, Parliament too must become involved in steering things. I should like to make three suggestions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, if there is no new money, we must simply reprioritise within the budgets. We must take a good look at where the big money is to be found within agriculture and the Cohesion Fund and focus it much more on the necessary aspects such as the agreements on the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, more flexibility must be introduced, as the Commissioner has already indicated. Without flexibility, we could never have raised the funds for the recovery plan in connection with the crisis. We must step up the search for any areas where leeway remains, for opportunities for deploying funds differently.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, we need to innovate. An example is the transfer of funds from the Seventh Research Framework Programme to the European Investment Bank (EIB). These funds were then used to provide subordinated loans to the business community and universities, thus giving tremendous momentum to investments for the coming years at this point in the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Reimer Böge, for these questions and this debate on the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier today, we voted on Budget 2011 and we all know how difficult it was to manoeuvre within the very tight margins in the budget. We also know that we were due a mid-term review of the budget. Regarding the non-paper which I read from the Commission, I would like to ask what status it has now. I know it is slightly off this point, but are some of the ideas contained in it still within the Commission’s framework for further discussion? I am particularly concerned about attitudes to agriculture spending and any attempts to renationalise that policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Others have, of course, discussed the realities for Member State budgets and Member State governments as well as the concern about looking for additional funding when all our Member States are having financial and economic problems. However, if we are to have more Europe, there is a requirement for more resources. I think one of the great difficulties we have in this Parliament is that we have not communicated enough the value of a European Union budget and what it does.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you recall – again in the votes today – we voted on the Globalisation Fund. When citizens are in difficulty, whether it is from flooding or a jobs crisis, they turn to the European Union for support and they turn to it for budget support. That provides solidarity to the European Union, which is something that you cannot put a price on. I think we have to be conscious of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we continue to measure and count euros, rather than looking at what we are trying to create in the European Union, I think we will limit our vision for the future of what we all hold dear at the European Union. That said, perhaps the analogy of a cake is appropriate at this point – that people look at the European Union budget in the shape of a cake. If we have more demands on it, we will continue to slice it ever thinner unless we increase the resources.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework is a process that is essential for the future of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Under the Treaty of Lisbon, a set of new responsibilities is transferred to EU level, and those responsibilities demand resources. However, in the light of the present Multiannual Financial Framework and of the reduced margins appearing under the various headings, I do not think we will be able to finance the new responsibilities provided for by the treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">In an economic crisis such as the one we are experiencing, it is unlikely that Member States will increase their contributions, but we can review the current economic framework. This means we can look at how to make best use of the resources that we do have available. It is in this context, then, that we must re-examine the new Multiannual Financial Framework, because the alternative option of burying our heads in the sand and pretending we cannot see the problem does not strike me as being the best strategy for dealing with it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">You are right, Commissioner, when you say that the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013 and its review must project a political vision, and we must have the courage to embrace this new political vision. The EU 2020 strategy has to form the basis for reviewing the Multiannual Financial Framework and for the future financial outlook.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis is having an impact on both the EU and national budgets. We need solutions to resolve the social crisis as well, which has evolved as a result of the economic and financial crisis. The mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework provides a good platform for the European Union’s economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to mention, in particular, the development of the transport infrastructure and energy efficiency in buildings. Just in April 2009, we amended the regulation so that all Member States enjoy a rate of 4% of the ERDF allocation to be used for energy efficiency in residential buildings and for the building of social housing. Has the Commission started to adjust operational programmes along with Member States in order to adapt them and increase the level of absorption of European funds?</p>

Do you agree that the Lisbon Treaty’s new competences are our best means to modernise our economy? I do. Do you think this is the way for us to achieve jobs and growth? I do.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think the Commissioner said at the outset, and he was correct, that we need to learn the lessons from the financial crisis and take measures to ensure that it does not happen again.</p>
      <p sl="en">He is absolutely right in that and, obviously, the Lisbon Treaty gives us stronger control over those situations because, in the recent past, the real lesson to be learnt is that politics and politicians were not in control, that we allowed bankers, regulators and rating agencies to do as they wished and we see now where we are as a result of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must ensure that that never happens again and we, as politicians, and particularly here in the European Union, have to take control because we are supposed to be in control and everybody else should fall into line beneath that, observe the law and ensure that proper practices are operated on a daily basis.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to respond to some of the speeches; not all of them, because there have been a great many, but I would like to respond to some of them briefly.</p>
      <p sl="es">To Mr Lewandowski in particular: I would like to express my agreement with his concern that at this time of economic uncertainty and difficulty, all available resources should be used by the Member States and by the European Union itself to combat unemployment and get out of the crisis as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to Mr Marinescu that it was indeed agreed in the Council’s guidelines that strengthening the External Action Service would not result in higher costs. In other words, it should not, under any circumstances, involve greater expenditure and devoting more resources for this purpose, but rather budgetary neutrality would be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="es">To Mrs Gardiazábal Rubial, I would like to say that the current budgetary framework provides sufficient flexibility mechanisms to cover some of the initiatives that she is proposing, and that the European Union budget is not in deficit, but it is, of course, fed by contributions from the Member States, and especially from the gross national income resource. It is easy to appreciate that more intensive use of this resource would aggravate the individual situations faced by each of the Member States which, as you are all aware, are very delicate at the moment. Using this channel to increase the EU budget would therefore be contradictory in the crisis situation that we are experiencing.</p>
      <p sl="es">This initial position does not, however, mean that a review cannot be considered if exceptional circumstances exist or arise, as has happened in the past on several occasions, in this planning period. This can, however, only be done if the other financing options have been considered.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to Mrs Trüpel that it may indeed be interpreted externally that the Commission is suggesting that the Council is not being accurate about the need or the path that needs to be followed in order to change the financial framework and, in turn, the Council could be asking it for a document to serve as a platform for launching that review. The fact is, however, that we are all immersed in a very complicated macro-economic situation, as I said before, which requires two things: firstly, making it a priority to solve the problems at national level, and secondly, maintaining the EU’s efforts, as they are now in the current financial framework, without any changes until we have a sufficiently documented and agreed study.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to stress to Mr Wlosowicz that I support him in his defence of the cohesion policy. The Council has always defended this policy as an emblem of the European Union and a platform for achieving the convergence targets that the EU has set itself. It should therefore be understood that the Council will always fully support this policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to Mrs Andreasen that I do indeed agree with her that in the current situation, it is not possible to increase the EU’s resources. Therefore, as I said before in my first speech, we need to use those resources by prioritising and redistributing allocations to make spending increasingly efficient and achieve our objectives in the most intelligent way.</p>
      <p sl="es">This does not in any way mean that there is a risk of democracy being lost in any of the countries that you mentioned, and I therefore think that we should eliminate even the possibility of a risk of that happening, even if it is very remote.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to Mr van der Stoep, I would like to say that we are going to propose that the possibility of flexibility in the Financial Framework Regulation be looked at.</p>
      <p sl="es">To Mr Cozzolino, I would like to say that my position is the same as I expressed before, i.e. that in the current mindset, it will be difficult for the Member States, who are making a huge effort to reduce the deficit, to put more resources in the European Union budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to Mr Ehrenhauser that we are going to prioritise and redistribute heading 5 as far as possible and reduce its size or allocation, provided that this does not negatively affect control or intelligent and efficient allocation of expenditure. This measure is therefore part of the general move towards flexibility and prioritisation that I was talking about before.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must say to Mr Fernandes that under no circumstances are we considering postponing the Multiannual Financial Framework. On the contrary, things are progressing normally and the new financial framework will be adopted at the appropriate time.</p>
      <p sl="es">I say the same to Mrs McGuinness: it is not possible to allocate more resources at the moment, given the shortages, the worsening of the economic situation and the difficulties that many countries are experiencing, and what we therefore need to do is try to find a way to use those resources better.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say, in response to another speaker, that the EU budget has been adapted in order to respond to the crisis and has not been stagnant in the face of this new situation that has arisen in the last two years, and it has also responded to the social challenges that have arisen. This is what happened, for example, with the European Economic Recovery Plan.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, and finally, I will pass on the remainder of the comments from Members to the Council and would like to thank them personally and also on behalf of the Council for their speeches.</p>

    <intervention id="2-517" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Members for their interventions. Listening to your comments, I can hear the clear voice in favour of revision that is, in your understanding, fresh money to finance the new challenges. On the other hand, I can also hear the concern as to the implications of the present financial crisis that is enforcing deep reductions in public expenditure in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were many questions on the review – which is no longer the mid-term review as it is delayed in agreement with the two arms of the budgetary power. It will come in September and will include quantifications of new own resources of the possible candidates to replace the national contributions that have been dominant so far. It will not be so much a technical report as a political one, concerning also the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty, which finds a strong supporter in Mrs Herczog. I believe that Lisbon should not be associated only with additional administrative expenditure – which is the case nowadays – and should prove that this is value added, not only regarding the new posts and new type of administrative expenditure that is normally least loved by taxpayers in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to Article 8.3, deleted by the Council, we are to defend flexibility in one form or another. This is the clear conclusion from our conciliations since 2007. Mr Garriga Polledo has enumerated several major challenges. It is not about supervisory agencies but mainly about ITER, Galileo and other large-scale projects, difficult to place within the existing multiannual framework. However we have quantifications. For ITER, it is very clear what will in come in 2012-13. However, we need long-term commitment before budgeting with this need to find the solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to the administration, I cannot promise Mr Ehrenhauser full answers about transparency, but I can promise that we are very serious in the Commission about zero growth. There will be no additional posts until 2013. That is my understanding of the self-restraint that is needed in the time of crisis. I cannot respond fully to the questions on how to operate with surpluses under the present regime, but it might be a contribution to the discussion of the rules of the next financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms McGuinness asked about the non-paper. This is already forgotten, passé , non-existent! New papers should appear in October or November on the two big spending areas – cohesion and the common agricultural policy – and should be of a different nature to the one that has been leaked, the so-called non-paper.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am looking forward to cooperating on further steps. The calendar is very clear, with a vote on the Lisbon package in November in the Parliament and possible culmination with the conciliation. That is, a vote in October and conciliation in November.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I do apologise, but since we have a couple of minutes before the next item, I would just like to make two concluding comments.</p>
      <p sl="de">I understand the difficult plight of the Member States from some of the arguments put forward by the Presidency-in-Office. However, the Council’s replies still do not fully reflect the necessities and budgetary challenges facing the European Union as a whole, nor its future direction. That is why we have to work together.</p>
      <p sl="de">From the Commissioner’s replies, I take it that he has opened the door an inch for further talks and we will now be trying to get a foot in that door. The Committee on Budgets will, therefore, present an interim report on the procedure for approval of the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework on the basis of Article 81 of the Rules of Procedure, so that plenary is given the negotiating mandate for further talks in September.</p>

      <p sl="el">The Treaty of Lisbon sets new priorities for the EU, while the EU 2020 strategy contains ambitious targets in crucial sectors for the future of the EU, which change the data on which the current Multiannual Financial Framework is based. More importantly, the consequences of the recent economic crisis, which are not yet fully understood and continue to expand, have shown that the challenges which we are being called on to respond to are changing drastically year on year and require adjustments at numerous levels if our policies are to be effective. However, we all know that every new policy, initiative and programme developed by the EU cannot be implemented without the necessary funds. The margins of the current Multiannual Financial Framework are very narrow, even suffocating I would say, and they leave no room for manoeuvre in coming years; for example, on the basis of the margins under Titles 1a and 4, unforeseen requirements cannot be met. We therefore urgently need to revise the current Multiannual Financial Framework in order to make provision for the necessary resources that will allow the EU to honour its undertakings and respond to the increased demands of European citizens. In wasting time, we are wasting opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="en">In response to the important and topical question from Ms Andrikienė, let me say that the Commission is fully aware of all the violations of the democratic principles and procedures which have been reported by a number of NGOs in the context of the local elections in Belarus. The European Union’s heads of mission in Minsk have also pointed to inconsistencies and indeed discrepancies, in particular, in the ballot counting.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some amendments were made, ahead of the elections, to the Belarus electoral code. According to the opinion of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which was issued on 3 June 2010, this represented, and I quote, ‘a step towards removing some flaws’ in the electoral code. However, the report states that these amendments are unlikely to resolve the concerns that the electoral code continues to fall short of genuinely democratic elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of this, during the visit I intend to pay to Minsk in July, I will convey to the authorities the clear message that progress needs to be made in a number of areas which are key to democratisation if Belarus is serious about re-engaging with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of these areas is electoral legislation, which is one of the most evident tests of democratic standards. In this respect, I will urge Minsk to continue to cooperate with the OSCE order on the reform of the electoral code ahead of the next presidential elections. In the run up to these elections, the Commission will also pay particular attention to other key aspects of democratisation, notably freedom of assembly, of the media and of NGOs and civil society, more generally, where no progress has been reported in recent times.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Thank you very much for your answer, but I have an additional question. The world is reacting in different ways to events in Belarus. On 8 June, the US administration took the decision to extend for another year financial sanctions against high-ranking Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko. I feel that this is a response to the undemocratic local elections in Belarus and I would like to hear your assessment. Also, does the European Union intend to take similar action as a reaction to violations of civil, political and other human rights in Belarus? In other words, what position does the European Union plan to take?</p>

      <p sl="en">In the past, we have tried a policy of engagement and we have tried a policy of isolation, and, frankly, none of these policies worked perfectly; nor did they achieve what we wanted in the relationship with Belarus. What we are trying to do now is set up a basis for what I would call critical engagement. The Commission is working on the joint interim plan, which I would describe as a framework for both good and bad weather in the relationship between the European Union and Belarus. It provides a framework for the steps towards democratisation and gradual engagement from the European Union side. It will be shared with the European Council and, of course, with the European Parliament, and I strongly believe that this is the most proper answer to the violations of human rights we witness in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr Füle, I would like to thank you for this information, but I must raise two issues. Firstly, you are planning a visit to Belarus soon, and we have a particular request concerning national minorities. We have a situation there in which Belarusian citizens are often people from very different national groups. The problem concerns the treatment of Belarusian citizens of Polish origin. The second issue is a request that in all these measures, more emphasis be placed on setting up scholarships for Belarusian youth, because that is the most important course of action today.</p>

On the other hand, what is very much on my agenda for the talks in Minsk is not only the general issues related to human rights violations, but also the specific questions concerning minorities. I am paying particular attention to this issue. I had a meeting with Ms Andżelika Borys and other representatives of the Belarus opposition, discussing not only the state of the Polish minorities in Belarus, but also the ways in which the Commission and the European Union could help them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not consider this an isolated issue. I do not consider this a ballot issue, as some might portray. It is indeed a serious question. The relationship between the authorities and minorities is going to be raised during my talks in Minsk.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Effects of fiscal adjustments on the credibility of the common European currency</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In order to gain acceptance for the euro on the part of European governments and the European public, the Commission launched a large-scale information campaign in all countries of the euro area with favourable results. Today, principally as a result of economic problems in these countries, accompanied by uncontrolled market speculation, the credibility of the euro is being seriously undermined, creating widespread public concern and uncertainty in Europe according to national surveys. Can the Commission provide the following information:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Have special public opinion soundings been taken in Europe by population category?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What measures are being envisaged to improve the image of the common currency and its credibility in the eyes of the public?</p>

    <intervention id="2-532" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I want to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for a very pertinent question – or rather a set of questions – because the image and credibility of the euro is an issue of major concern for all of us Europeans at this critical juncture and these difficult times. The euro is not only a monetary arrangement; it is also a core political project – if not the core political project – of the European Union. Therefore, the fate of the euro, the image of the euro, the credibility of the euro has major implications for the overall European project.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have here a carefully calibrated draft answer of four pages which I asked my services to prepare. I am tempted to read it out, but it would take some 12 minutes of your time. However, I am ready to make this available and I can also put it on my website. This is not only a matter of media actions and campaigns – no matter how important they are – it is also a matter of policies and concrete actions in order to defend the euro from the systemic attacks it has been under recently.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just say in passing that we are carrying out regular quantitative surveys. We have regular flash Eurobarometer surveys which we conduct in all Member States – we have done it in different waves. We are using every opportunity to actively communicate the latest developments and policy actions taken in respect of the euro and economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The concerns of the general public are addressed through all available channels, such as the website, publications, questions and answers, leaflets as well as various networks dealing with economic policy making, trade unions, employers’ organisations and so on and so forth. We are working on all fronts together with the Member States in order to get the message across concerning the euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the policies which are at the heart of the matter, and this deals with part ‘b’ of Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s question: What measures are being envisaged to improve the image of the common currency and its credibility in the eyes of the public?</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to make three points on this. First, we have decided on a very substantial financial backstop called the European financial stability mechanism and facility – almost EUR 500 billion – which, together with the rescue package for Greece on coordinated and conditional financial assistance, has helped to stop the bush fire of financial uncertainty before it has turned into a forest fire all over Europe. We are taking concrete steps in order to safeguard financial stability and the euro in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, our Member States are making great efforts in fiscal consolidation. In fact, there is a wave of fiscal consolidation and structural reform going on in Europe in order to restore and reinforce confidence and credibility in the euro and economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not doing it without careful calibration; we are doing it in a coordinated and differentiated manner so that those countries with no or little fiscal space, such as Greece, Spain and Portugal, have to accelerate fiscal consolidation. While many other countries still have fiscal space, they should not start consolidation before next year – this is to ensure that we do not suffocate the current ongoing economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just today, we presented a total of 15 excessive deficit procedures, and on the basis of our assessment, our Member States’ strategies of fiscal consolidation are in line with this coordinated and differentiated fiscal exit strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, reinforcing economic governance is absolutely essential in order to reinforce the credibility of the euro and I do indeed count on your support when you vote on the resolution on Europe 2020 and on reinforcing economic governance. We need your support in order to convince the European Council – convince the Member States – and keep up the momentum so that we can have these more rigorous systems of budgetary and economic surveillance and policy coordination in place by the beginning of next year.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply and for giving us all a chance to remember the policy to support the single currency and the survival of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="el">The spirit of my question related more to the communication that we need to apply, because the citizens do not understand these unprecedented technical issues in the economic life of Europe and they do not share them and there is a risk that they will feel that support for the euro has a price rather than a secure future. This is fuelled by scenarios and threats of some countries leaving the single currency.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is the joint responsibility of the Member States and the European bodies to support the achievement of the euro, but public opinion needs supportive measures which have nothing to do with financial adjustments in their countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with your way of reasoning and I think it is essential that we see the euro as a key policy instrument for economic policy and sustainable growth in Europe and, at the same time, that we look at it not only as a symbol but also as a bond for Europeans in building the common European home. In this regard, we have organised a broad range of communication activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">For instance, in the first half of 2010 – I will just give you the highlights – we carried out an information campaign on the key benefits of the euro in 10 euro area countries: Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Finland, Malta and Belgium. We also organised the Brussels Economic Forum, devoted to economic and financial issues, which took place two weeks ago. A record number of policy areas, more than 1 000, were agreed on and the event was widely reported by the media. This was clearly a case of reaching out to the opinion makers and trying to have a multiplier effect through this important forum. I could continue the list.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are engaged in these activities and I think we will achieve the best results by having the right policies and having the right kind of campaigns in order to ensure that our people are well informed.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my youth, I trained as a spare parts salesman; I started at 12 and I ended that career at 20. We always had a very clear philosophy: that you have to have the product right before you can market it well: you need both. You need a solid product, solid policies and you need a sound marketing campaign in order to win the hearts and minds of our people.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to your reply very carefully. I do not know if the twelve page memorandum which you mentioned includes a reply to one part of my fellow Member’s question, to be precise, the integration of new countries into the euro area and the prospects for such integration.</p>
      <p sl="el">I know – and you know – that the new member is Estonia. What we are seeing is that, in order for these countries to enter the euro area, harsh financial restructuring programmes are being applied, with the result that in Estonia today, drastic cuts in civil servants’ wages are being applied, unemployment has reached 20% and unemployment among young people is many times higher.</p>

      <p sl="en">The reason why Estonia has had to enforce budgetary discipline is not primarily the euro, but the fact that Estonia’s economy faced a very serious financial crisis, like all of us, and economic growth stalled. There was negative economic growth, which meant that Estonia’s public finances were simply no longer on a sustainable basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Estonia’s debt level is very low: 7.2% for the moment, while the European average is 75%, but the gradient was very worrying and it was only common sense in economic terms to ensure that Estonia will be able to continue its stability-oriented policies and ensure the sustainability of its public finances. This was the democratic decision of the Estonian Parliament recently and this has been the policy followed in Estonia with quite some success.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Commissioner, as we know, Greece is the weakest link in the euro chain and it took two months for Greece to be granted an aid package.

      <p sl="en">I do not want to enter into any kind of blame game. My view is that politics, and economic policy making in the European Union, is always a matter of political will but also the art of what is possible. This time, it became possible at some point to take those decisions, to provide conditional and coordinated financial assistance for Greece, and later on to create the European Financial Stability Mechanism. These are now working.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning Greece, the first tranches of a total of EUR 20 billion from the EU and the IMF were sent to Greece in mid-May. Greece is implementing its joint EU-IMF programme in time and according to the memorandum of understanding. Moreover, the recently decided European Financial Stability Mechanism and Facility are readily available, so that the Community instrument, which is up to EUR 60 billion, can use the Union budget as loan guarantees for possible operations. This is up and running. It is readily available, if requested and if genuinely needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meanwhile, the Special Purpose Vehicle of up to EUR 440 billion, the intergovernmental arrangement which is also called the European Financial Stability Facility, is going to be ratified by 90% of the volume, which is the criterion, by the end of this month and it will be operational a few weeks after that. This means that, if we have an immediate and pressing need, we have the tools to tackle this with this mechanism and this facility.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final point is that this only buys us time, and the essence is that we have to engage in a very serious campaign of fiscal consolidation in Europe, where the past two years have wiped out 20 years of fiscal consolidation in the past two decades.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 19 by Mairead McGuinness (H-0257/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU Structural Funds - funding exclusion</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The EU, as signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities reflects the core elements – of anti-discrimination, equal opportunities and active inclusion measures – in its own disability strategy.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In March 2010, the Commission was represented at a conference in Brussels hosted by the European Coalition for Community Living which addressed the issue of ‘Funding exclusion while promoting inclusion? The use of European Union funding to maintain the institutionalisation of people with disabilities’.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Commission is aware of the concern among NGOs that European Structural Funds are being used to renovate existing, or build new, long-stay residential institutions for people with disabilities, in contravention of the rights of these citizens.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given the strong convergence of objectives between the overall EU Disability Strategy and the UN Convention, what action will the Commission take to address this problem and ensure that EU funds are not used in this inappropriate way, but are rather directed towards the provision of community-based living for persons with disabilities?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-540" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I would like to answer the oral question tabled by Mrs McGuinness by saying that, although the responsibility of organising and administering residential care lies with Member States, the Commission is keen to promote the right of people with disabilities to live independently by supporting services in the community as an alternative to living in institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the end of this year, the Commission will have adopted a European disabilities strategy for the years 2010-20, which will set out a coherent framework for implementing the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disability. Providing support for people with disabilities to live independently and de-institutionalising all the systems will be among the priorities. In particular, it will highlight the potential role of the Structural Funds in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Priorities for the use of Structural Funds are, of course, set at national and regional level, but the Commission will work with the Member States on the exchange of good practice and guidelines as to how best to use those funds in order to promote the personal autonomy and the right of persons with disabilities to live independently.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to mention the European Social Fund as an instrument to eliminate the barriers to the participation of people with disabilities as equal members of society. The Social Fund can finance, among other things, counselling, training adapted to the specific needs of people with disabilities, rehabilitation, job creation in sectors such as social economy, special support to promote entrepreneurship among persons with disabilities, and awareness raising campaigns to combat discrimination. It can also provide training and retraining of staff to facilitate the transition from institutional care to community-based services.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Regional Development Fund can be used concurrently to develop social infrastructure to support such new services.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard, the Commission has drawn up a tool kit for using the Structural Funds in order to ensure access for, and non-discrimination against, people with disabilities. This tool kit is designed in order to allow the management authorities, the intermediate bodies or the project promoters to prepare, implement, monitor and evaluate the Structural Fund programmes and projects.</p>

      <p sl="en">On behalf of Mrs McGuinness, who tabled the question, I thank you for your frank and detailed response. I have just one or two brief questions. Firstly, is the Commission taking any action against those who have used structural funds inappropriately, particularly in the area where we are discussing the provision of facilities for people with disabilities? Secondly, how soon can we actually eliminate such practices, if at all, in the Member States?</p>

      <p sl="en">If there is a misuse of structural funds in general, the Commission can intervene, but there is, of course, the primary obligation and responsibility of the Member State in order to bring forward their policy agenda and organise their own social protection systems, including those people in long-term care institutions. The question, of course, is: could we veto it if the Member States are continuing to invest in a different way? You know that the Structural Funds are spent on a system of shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States. However, it is up to the Member States and their regions to manage the programmes and to implement them by selecting programmes and projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, even if we cannot veto, we have already been working together with Member States in order to change the policy in the Member States. For instance, with the Bulgarian Government, we have, for two years, had a cooperative approach under which the government did not use the money in residential institutions, but undertook that no EU funds would be spent on investing in existing residential institutions and that for any investment in these sectors, the principle of de-institutionalisation would be followed.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First of all, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her answer and for her commitment to the cause of people with disabilities. I have two additional related questions. The main problem regarding the use of Structural Funds did come up, which is primarily an issue in Eastern Europe. In the past, castles nationalised in the Communist era housed people with disabilities, primarily with mental disabilities. One of the problems is that money from Structural Funds was spent on the renovation of these castles, and then the castles were closed and the disabled were moved out. What will happen to these buildings? Does the Commission have a plan to examine this issue from a broader perspective, in relation to tourism and job creation?</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very well aware that a change of regime also means a change in the way you approach the remnants of past policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, it is up to the governments to decide how they are going to care for their institutions and whether or not they want to renovate their property and give it another use. I can only tell you that, as regards de-institutionalisation to bring disabled people into society and not leave them in institutions, we have tried to make the Commission staff responsible for discussions with the Member States aware of these aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 29 April 2010, DG Regio held a seminar for Commission staff called ‘Would you call this home?’, where best and worst practice in the use of EU funds for dismantling long-stay institutions were presented, so that our staff could understand which policies need to be applied in trying to change the mentality in their contacts with the administrations in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has also been very good interaction between DG Regio and DG Employment on further steps which could be taken, because we believe that Social Fund investment should serve the population in those areas. It should not only be used for renovating houses, but should also be used for creating jobs and growth in the areas concerned.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to bring your attention to what I believe is a very topical and specific issue. In my country, in Greece, and probably in other countries too, due to the austerity programmes, social spending is being cut and often funding for centres and foundations which provide services to the disabled is being stopped.</p>
      <p sl="el">I have before me one such recent example: a single centre providing services to people, mainly children, with visual problems and other disabilities. Fifty children have been left to their fate due to a lack of money. My question is: can these fifty children hope that this foundation will be eligible within the framework of funding under the European Social Fund? What can we do about this?</p>

      <p sl="en">We cannot intervene or force a government to change its policy. We can only take general measures to push a government into caring for its population.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things we can of course do with the Social Fund is to train the staff and help have better care for those people, but the basis decision on whether or not to have a foster house lies with the national governments.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 21 by Chris Davies (H-0246/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Securing EU environmental goals</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commission accept that excessive internal debate within the EU, and a failure to coordinate its full range of diplomatic sources across the world, contributed to the failure to secure EU objectives both at the UNFCCC Copenhagen climate change conference and at the meeting of the parties to CITES at Doha?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Will the Commission outline the steps it is taking to improve its advance planning and coordination with the object of raising its game and securing a more positive outcome at future environmental conferences?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-548" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr Davies, your question raises the important issue of the effectiveness of European Union diplomacy in international environmental negotiations, against the background of the disappointing results of the meetings in Copenhagen on Climate Change and in Doha on Trade in Endangered Species.</p>
      <p sl="en">We obviously need to learn a number of lessons from these experiences, against the background of the relevant provisions in the Lisbon Treaty. Having said that, in order to draw a balanced set of conclusions for the future, I think we must recognise that the reasons for the outcomes of these meetings are manifold and need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is, obviously, not an easy task to agree on a common position among 27 Member States, representing 500 million citizens, for international negotiations on complex issues that have a direct impact on the economy and society of the European Union. Nonetheless, both for the CITES and the climate change negotiations, this did not prevent the EU from agreeing on a common line and carrying out a range of outreach activities towards its international partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the CITES Conference of Parties, the EU position on many issues had been established more than six months before the meeting, outreach activities have been undertaken by EU and Member State delegations all around the world on important EU proposals on sharks and tigers, and internal EU discussions before and during the CoP on those topics ran smoothly. But I fully recognise that, in the case of bluefin tuna, these conditions were, unfortunately, not met to the same extent.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a more general note, the Commission considers that the EU will be able to act more effectively within CITES once it is a full party. The Commission will, therefore, step up its efforts to convince third countries, which have not yet done so, to ratify the Gaborone amendment to CITES, which allows the EU to join the convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to the climate change negotiations, the EU’s internal debate in the context of Copenhagen was not excessive and the EU has significantly improved the coordination of its diplomatic sources across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU had an intensive outreach schedule to third countries in the run-up to Copenhagen and prepared and presented a common position across all key issues during the Copenhagen meeting. In the run-up to Copenhagen, the EU used multiple coordinated EU Troika demarches in more than 40 countries, effected a range of joint Troika outreach missions, as well as attending various bilateral and multilateral informal dialogues. Its technical negotiating teams discussed and further developed EU positions during various bilateral visits to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking beyond the examples of the Copenhagen and Doha meetings, it is important to see that one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Treaty is to strengthen the Union’s voice in the world. The implementation of the Lisbon Treaty will notably reinforce the EU’s external representation in international environmental affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this field, the treaty tasks the Commission with ensuring the Union’s external representation. In case the Council considers it politically opportune that the Union engages in negotiations on international agreements, the treaty obliges the Council to authorise the Commission to conduct such negotiations on behalf of the Union for matters falling under Union competence. The Council may complement such authorisation by negotiating directives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament shall, of course, be immediately and fully involved at all stages of the procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is currently discussing with Member States in the Council how to implement this framework. In those discussions, the Commission is very vigilant that the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty effectively results in reinforcing the unity and the coherence of EU representation in multilateral negotiations. Any other interpretation of the Lisbon Treaty simply risks and, in fact, weakens the EU’s standing on the international arena, which is certainly not what the Lisbon Treaty was meant to bring about.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is at stake is the future of the EU organisation and efficiency in global environment negotiations, and the Commission counts on the support of Parliament on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commissioner and I will share objectives without question, and I support the Commission in its battle with the Council, but, as we look at conferences like CITES, I see the Japanese apparently going round from one embassy to another with a bag of gold. You would describe it as outreach work.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let me put a specific question to you, as you touched upon the strengthening of the European Union’s diplomatic abilities. What meetings have you had or will you have with Catherine Ashton to discuss how the External Action Service can be brought into the service of the Commission as a whole to ensure that our diplomatic abilities are played to the full?</p>

      <p sl="en">In answer to the specific question you asked: I have not had a meeting with Catherine Ashton on that issue. I think one thing is pretty clear as regards CITES, especially on the bluefin tuna; we have made a series of miscalculations – if I can put it that way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the position of the Commission was simply adopted too late. Secondly, I believe the discussion in the Council was held at the very last Coreper; and, even if I could discuss this issue with Catherine, it would still be too late.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I think we should learn from these experiences. But, as you rightly pointed out, this is one of the tasks which we will have to do together, and we have to also use our future – hopefully well-functioning – External Service for that purpose.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 22 by Dan Jørgensen (H-0255/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Dealing with EDC mixtures</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Studies from Denmark and Germany have shown that children, in particular, are exposed to a whole cocktail of different chemicals, and especially hormone disrupting chemicals, such as the phthalate plasticisers. These scientific findings mean that the REACH authorisation process for single hormone disrupting chemicals – which is based on the grounds that their concentrations would stay below their effect level – is no longer safe or effective, because together, these chemicals form a dangerous mixture.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission intend to close this gap in the REACH provisions and ensure that hormone disrupting chemicals are not authorised on the flawed assumption that we are only exposed to one chemical at a time?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question 23 by Fiona Hall (H-0265/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU action on endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The EU strategy for action on hormone-disrupting chemicals was adopted over 10 years ago, largely as a result of an initiative report by the European Parliament in 1997. Science has since then shown increasingly strong links between some endocrine disruptors and cancer, lower fertility and possible impacts on behaviour and development. Yet despite various political statements in support of the EU action plan on EDCs, and an agreed priority list of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), no practical action has yet been taken at EU level to remove hormone-disrupting chemicals from our environment.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Will the Commission now take action to make use of the results from the publicly-funded research and ensure that these chemicals with a high risk to human health can be dealt with as a priority under REACH?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What concrete measures will the Commission propose in its forthcoming report on implementation of the EU EDC strategy?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-552" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission is aware of a number of studies concerning the combined effects of different chemicals. In particular, at the end of 2009, the Danish authorities published the results from a number of studies that examined the cumulative impact of different endocrine-disrupting substances on sensitive groups such as young children and female workers, as you mentioned in your question.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danish study gave rise to the Council conclusions adopted in December 2009, in which the Commission was asked to examine how current EU legislation addressed the cumulative effects of different endocrine disruptors and, more broadly, to look at the general problem of how to deal with the cumulative effects of these types of chemicals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the general question of the cumulative effects of chemicals, the Commission recently made available through the Internet a state-of-the-art report on mixture toxicity which was the result of the two-year study funded by DG Environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is now engaged in consulting stakeholders on this report and has also submitted a formal request concerning mixture toxicity to the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Risks and the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products.</p>
      <p sl="en">By early 2012 at the latest, the Commission will, on the basis of the study and the associated consultation process, finalise a report assessing how and whether relevant existing Community legislation, including REACH, adequately addresses risks from exposure to multiple chemicals from different sources and pathways and, on this basis, it will consider appropriate modifications, guidelines and assessment methods.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the launching of the Community strategy on endocrine disruptors in 1999, we have invested heavily through the Community research budget to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which substances affect the functioning of endocrine systems. Over the same period, we have included specific measures to address endocrine disruptors in two key pieces of chemicals legislation, REACH and the Plant Protection Products Regulation. The Commission has also participated actively in international initiatives to develop testing methods and testing strategies for the identification of endocrine disruptors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission has recently launched a major study to consolidate all the latest scientific information and to make recommendations concerning testing strategies and criteria for the identification of substances with endocrine-disrupting properties. The study will be finalised by the second half of next year. The results from this study will be taken into account in reviewing the existing Community strategy on endocrine disruptors and to provide input to the implementation of the existing EU legislation, by which I mean both the Plant Protection Products Regulation and also REACH.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, in summary, the Commission is aware of the seriousness of the questions you both raised and it is working intensively to address it in the most effective ways. It is not an easy thing because a lot of knowledge is still missing, but it is certainly a complex problem which deserves our attention and utmost consideration in the future.</p>

      <p sl="da">Commissioner, you say that in 2012, you will present a report in which you will reach a conclusion as to whether there are grounds to revise the legislation on account of the fact that it does not take account of cocktail effects. In this respect, I can save you the trouble, as we are already now able to confirm that this is the case. The legislation does not take account of cocktail effects. Those of us who have worked on REACH and those who know REACH in detail – as I know you do – know only too well that cocktail effects have simply not been taken into account when it comes to the most hazardous substances: carcinogenic substances and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Moreover, REACH is based on two fundamental principles: the precautionary principle and the principle of protecting the most vulnerable consumers in our market, in other words, children and pregnant women, among others. So, should the Commission not present proposals now for revising REACH and perhaps also other types of legislation in order to stipulate that cocktail effects must be taken into account in the authorisation process on the basis of the substitution principle?</p>

      <p sl="en">As I have said, the real problem in this area is the lack of solid science and facts. You rightly mention the precautionary principle. We are bound by the treaty to follow the precautionary measures in the area of the environment also, but I would still like to get as much data as possible and to base the proposals on as much solid science as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 1999, the year when this approach started, we have already had 84 studies within the Community, with approximately two million involved. However, when I discussed that with my colleagues yesterday in order to get a brief outline of the details, their main message was actually exactly this: that we still lack knowledge to have very concrete measures. But certainly you can be reassured that this will be actively under my consideration in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">I thank you, Commissioner, for your reply, but I have an immense feeling of frustration because this is 13 years that this has been under consideration – 84 studies over 13 years. There are certain parts of the population, particularly unborn children, who are extremely vulnerable to these chemicals, and the changes have been shown to be irreversible, so people’s lives have been blighted from before birth as a result of this.</p>

      <p sl="en">I could actually repeat the answer. The fact is that when we talk about the precautionary principle, I think it is extremely important how we consider it and what we consider it to be, under that activity. I would simply like to have more data gathered. With the study we launched, we did not launch the study through which we would like to get the cumulative knowledge of what we have accumulated through the EU research programmes, but to have an overview of everything which is going around – all the knowledge we have globally. That is the whole intention, but I can fully understand your frustration. As you know, I have been in this area for half a year and I will certainly look fully into all the things which you have underlined and try to see how we can best handle that in the future.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 24 by Seán Kelly (H-0256/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Floods Directive Implementation</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission give an update as to the implementation of the Floods Directive (2007/60/EC), with special reference to Ireland?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-560" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr Kelly, the Floods Directive was adopted in 2007 and the process of implementation is under way. In the last month, new floods have reminded us of the serious consequences of floods and of the importance of flood risk management which focuses on prevention, preparedness and protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Floods Directive requires all Member States to prepare comprehensive plans to reduce flood risks. Importantly, the public and interested parties need to be consulted on these plans, and Member States need to cooperate in transboundary waterways. The first two implementation deadlines have already expired.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the legal transposition into national law was due by November 2009. To date, 12 Member States, including Ireland, have met this deadline. Ten Member States have not yet notified their transposition of the directive, and five Member States have only notified partial transposition. The Commission is pursuing infringement cases to respond to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the notification by the Member States to the Commission of administrative arrangements, the deadline expires on 26 June of this year. Twenty three Member States, including Ireland, have notified. The Commission is now checking that all relevant information on the responsible authorities and the geographical coverage of the units of management is in compliance with the directive. The main implementation milestones are still some time away.</p>
      <p sl="en">Across the European Union, Member States are preparing these steps, which are: firstly, to carry out a preliminary flood risk assessment in 2011 and to identify areas of potential significant flood risks; secondly, to prepare detailed flood hazard maps and flood risk maps by 2013; and, thirdly, to prepare the first flood risk management plans in 2015. The public and interested parties must also be consulted on these plans before they are adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards Ireland, we understand the implementation is well under way and we have no reason to believe Ireland is delayed in implementing the directive. Ireland has notified the legislation transposing the directive and has reported administrative arrangements. We furthermore welcome the fact that Ireland has already undertaken pilot exercises in the Dodder catchment in the Dublin area as well as in the Lee catchment in the south of Ireland – where a draft catchment flood risk management plan was prepared and submitted to public consultation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ireland also takes an active role at the European level in promoting valuable information exchange between the Member States on different topics related to the implementation of the directive, such as on how to deal with flash and pluvial floods, flood mapping and development of flood risk management plans.</p>

      <p sl="en">I shall be brief out of respect for others. Firstly, Commissioner, thank you for a very detailed and comprehensive response, which I deeply value. I have just one supplementary. In the event of countries not meeting deadlines, would the Commission not consider making the Solidarity Fund available in the event of flooding taking place in the future – or in the past, because we have an application in at the minute regarding flooding?</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, the flooding during the summer did a lot of damage in Ireland, particularly to the infrastructure, to shops and to housing. In total, it cost almost EUR 1 billion.</p>
      <p sl="ga">However, all the blame cannot be attached to the rainfall; the biggest problem in Ireland was that the waterways have not been maintained. The Waterways Directive is a very important directive. As well as that, a lot of damage has been done – and is still being done – to wildlife, particularly to rare birds, because the Birds Directive has not been implemented either.</p>

    <intervention id="2-565" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Firstly, many of you have mentioned funding. There are two possibilities: one is prevention, when we should look to the Cohesion Fund; the second relates to the funds at European level – Interreg and all the activities connected with that.</p>
      <p sl="en">When disaster occurs, there is certainly another possibility – mentioned by an honourable Member – namely the European Solidarity Fund. The European Union Solidarity Fund has very clear guidelines concerning implementation and the nature of the damage. In the case of the Irish application for the Solidarity Fund, the damage caused was below the threshold but the Commission is in the process of assessing that application.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the amount of the damage is below the normal threshold for mobilising the Solidarity Fund of 0.6%, the specific criteria for exceptional mobilisation must be met. If this is assessed to be the case, then the aid can be guaranteed. However, we should not simply mix the two things – the purpose of one and the purpose of the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree about the sharing of best practice, which was mentioned – I think it is important that management plans are drawn up in a proper and correct way. Regarding the cross-border effect, we are very much in support of this in the Water Framework Directive. The river basin approach is one which looks across borders and which is establishing a kind of connection where the Member States should cooperate. They are asked to cooperate and, in fact, are bound to do so in preparing their cross-border solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would mention that in 2012, we want to produce a blueprint on waters and their management. Within that blueprint, there will be three topics which we want to address. One of the topics to which we will give our attention will be droughts.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 25 by Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė (H-0262/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Revision of the EIA Directive (85/337/EEC)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">From time to time, we hear of problems arising during the planning and implementation of large-scale infrastructure projects, especially in the energy sector. Most of the problems arise because of the lack of transparency and impartiality in the environmental impact assessments of such projects. Current legislation (Directive 85/337/EEC), as can be seen from the recent Commission report, does not provide for the environmental assessment to be genuinely independent. Two main solutions to this issue are put forward: first, closer Commission involvement in the environmental assessment procedure or, second, ensuring that the financing of the environmental assessment is independent of the developer of the project being assessed.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">When is the Commission planning to present the reviewed text of the EIA Directive? Which option is the Commission likely to choose in order to guarantee the independence of the environmental assessment?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-567" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">It is true that under the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive, the responsibility for gathering the necessary environmental information and submitting it to the public authorities is given to the developer. However, this does not result in an opaque and partial EIA process as the directive contains several safeguards which ensure a transparent and objective environmental assessment of projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">These safeguards are to be found, firstly, in the description of the minimum information to be included in the environmental impact assessment report which is required by the EIA Directive and, secondly, in the consultations with the competent environmental authorities and the public. Indeed, all the information provided by the developer has to be made public to the environmental authorities and the public, which have to be consulted.</p>
      <p sl="en">The accuracy of this information can be challenged at any point of the consultations, before the final decision is taken. This means that the competent environmental authorities can use their own capacity to proceed with a proper assessment of the information provided, while NGOs or interested parties can – and very often do – challenge the whole assessment on the basis of the data provided, in case they do not reflect the real situation or omit clearly to conform to the requirements of the EIA provisions. The final decision to grant or refuse development consent must take into consideration the results of consultations and the information gathered and must contain the main reasons on which it is based. All this is also made available to the public.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, to be honest, your question is very relevant. After more than 20 years of implementation, we have identified the areas where improvements are needed and reached the conclusion that the EIA Directive should be reviewed. My objective is to present a new text which will further improve environmental protection, take on board the challenges in the areas of climate change, energy and biodiversity, integrate the ECJ case-law and harmonise and simplify, to the extent possible, existing procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the overall quality of the environmental assessments will be a central issue, and there is certainly room for improvement. On the one hand, the quality control of the EIA documentation submitted by the developer could be improved. On the other hand, the quality of the EIA process itself could be reinforced.</p>
      <p sl="en">My services have already started working on the review of the EIA Directive. By the end of June, a broad consultation of the public and of the stakeholders will be launched. You are, of course, invited to participate and also express your views.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once all the relevant data and information are on the table, the Commission will identify the appropriate policy options for amending the EIA Directive, including ways of ensuring the independence of the environmental assessments. Any Commission proposal will have to be subject to a legislative impact assessment. I am not yet in a position to give you a date for the Commission’s proposal, but my intention is clearly to present this proposal during my mandate, better sooner than later, though of course, there is still some quite serious work to be done before then.</p>

      <p sl="lt">This problem is important for Member States, important in the sense of projects being carried out locally in Member States and important in terms of international projects, an example of which would probably be energy infrastructure projects, like the Nordstream project in the Baltic Sea. As you mentioned, society has the right to participate and operators should take account of society’s concerns, but somehow, not even information from independent scientists was taken into account. That is why today, we are discussing the need to establish an independent impact assessment mechanism and I would like to ask whether you think that the European Commission could regulate Member State national law in this matter, or, supposing it is an international project, whether the European Commission itself could intervene in such things?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-569" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">In essence, once again you have pointed to the right direction. If the project or the investment does not have cross-border effects, then it is pretty clear how the thing should be done. Subsidiarity is clearly at stake here and I would have nothing to add.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the process is transparent, if everybody can have a view – this, by the way, was the intention of the EIA Directive amendments in the past and, in 2003, this was aligned with the Aarhus Convention which should provide exactly that – then the process should lead to the things you mention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Things are a bit more complicated when you talk about cross-border. What the directive is currently asking with regard to cross-border is that negotiations or better information exchange take place with the parties concerned. That should happen already under the EPSA Convention, but if it is in the context of the European Union Member States then, of course, this EIA Directive applies.</p>
      <p sl="en">To be honest, the Commission has more or less a procedural role in that respect. We have to take care that all the necessary procedures are taken into account, necessary procedures which ideally should lead to an independent impact assessment, done first hand by the developer, checked if necessary, and looked at by the Member States’ authorities. This is what we are guaranteeing. We should know that we have brought two important things to the floor through inclusion of the EIA concept. One is that the environment is brought seriously into consideration when any kind of investment happens, and second that public consultation occurs in all cases so that things are transparent. But you are pointing in the right direction. I think the question, or what is implicitly behind your reasoning, is one of the issues I believe needs to be addressed in the future, in the revision of the EIA Directive, but I cannot give you an answer now as to which direction we will take. The discussion is starting now and I will certainly look into those details in the future.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 27 by Kathleen Van Brempt (H-0301/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Birds and Habitats Directives</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) and the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) permanently come under pressure. It is fashionable to maintain that they stand in the way of economic development. However, the example of the port of Antwerp demonstrates the contrary. Almost the whole of the port area is designated as a special protection area under the Birds Directive, but nature conservation and development go hand-in-hand here with economic development, as the Commissioner himself recently ascertained. Given the pressure which exists to relax these directives, it seems to me appropriate in this Year of Biodiversity to ask the Commissioner what is his position on the Birds and Habitats Directives:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commissioner agree with President Barroso, who stated in a letter to Prime Minister Balkenende that revision of the aforementioned directives was not needed but, on the contrary, stability in the relevant legislative framework, and that these directives allowed sufficient room for economic development?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-581" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The EU Habitats and Birds Directives as they stand provide the necessary flexibility to ensure compatibility between nature protection and economic development. The Commission does not believe that a review would be justified at this stage. The reasons are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU nature legislation sets a global model for nature protection – science-driven, legally enforceable and based upon ecosystems as the basic unit. The Natura network is one of the most advanced, most extensive and most flexible systems of nature protection in the world. It is one of the greatest achievements of European Union environmental policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Biodiversity is a key environmental priority for the Commission during its present term. In March this year, the Council reaffirmed that protected areas and ecological networks are a cornerstone of our efforts to preserve biodiversity and stressed the need to fully implement the Birds and Habitats Directives and speed up completion of the Natura 2000 network.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now at a crucial stage of implementation of the legislation. Across Europe, the process of designation of Natura 2000 sites is nearing completion and the priority is now to ensure that the Natura 2000 network is effectively managed and properly resourced so that it can fully achieve its objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU Habitats Directive is a unique, flexible tool, which allows farming, fishing, forestry, hunting and even major development projects to be carried out in a way that does not destroy the ecological value of our natural heritage. Natura sites are not no-go areas where human activities and economic development are to be excluded. Most sites are living landscapes which have been shaped as a result of many years of human intervention. Designation of a Natura site does not mean that economic activities within the site must be frozen. On the contrary, there are many examples such as the Port of Antwerp – which I visited recently and which is also mentioned in your question – where economic development successfully continues side by side with nature protection. Correct implementation of the provisions of the nature directives, early integration of environmental concerns into the planning process and broad information and involvement of all stakeholders are key to such success stories.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in view of the fact that we have not met the political target of halting the loss of biodiversity in 2010, we will have to assess the reasons why we have failed. In that context, we will also need to evaluate in detail whether implementation of our existing legislation is effective in delivering biodiversity protection and reflect on what improvements should eventually be made.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this issue. Allow me to begin with a question; a very simple question, but one which I think highlights the problem that we are talking about very well: if we had had Lehman Sisters instead of Lehman Brothers, would we be here today talking about this? We do not know because that is not the case, but what is clear is that the situation would have been very different from the one that we have today in the context of the credit crunch and the economic and financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is an extremely clear consensus among economists, both feminist and non-feminist, that the current crises have been caused by a series of institutions that are fundamentally, basically, run by men. We therefore have objective data that points to men being directly responsible for this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot say whether, if the majority had been women rather than men, the situation would have been the same, but I do believe that it is obvious that there would have been differences in both the cause and the management of the crisis and, of course, also in the current recovery.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do think it is important to highlight another significant fact: the financial agencies, for example, that have a greater proportion of women in their management bodies have suffered much less from this type of situation. I think that this compels us to stop and think, which is what we are doing in this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">To some extent, what we want to do is suggest that as well as being an extremely serious problem, this crisis is and must be an opportunity to correct some of the issues that led us along what was clearly an erroneous path. Bad policies and a lack of equality in many of those policies is one of those problems.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect, I would like to point out and highlight very clearly some of the shortcomings of the political responses to the crisis. They are not taking advantage of this opportunity: for example, at no point has a gender perspective been used in what is known as the ‘post-Lisbon perspective’, which is the 2020 strategy. So far, at least, there has not been an explicit drive for clear macro-economic policies and guidelines on employment with a clear and obvious gender perspective to be established. It is one thing to have declarations, but what we are interested in here are tangible commitments.</p>
      <p sl="es">The aim of this report is to at least open up the debate and put a few questions on the table that we feel are important. We are aware that there are some Member States, some governments – including the Presidency’s government: the Spanish Government – that have led the debate on this issue and put some issues on the table. As well as highlighting and acknowledging this, I also wish to support the coming presidencies, which are going to or will want to raise similar issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do, however, think it is important to point out something else. If we really want to correct some of these mistakes, it is very important that we understand that the causes include a series of key elements, and the first of them is the lack of political will to make clear equality policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we are therefore asking for in this report is firstly political will; secondly, imagination, which I think is important to highlight; and thirdly, and this is the key aspect of the report, measures that are tangible, clear and, if you will, binding and compulsory. We have had enough of good intentions.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we need are clear commitments, and I will say it once again: binding, mandatory commitments that have to be fulfilled. For example, establishing full employment, in terms of both men and women, but especially in terms of women, should be an objective in itself.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, a tangible objective is to aim for 75% female employment by 2020 or to reduce the salary gap to zero or to a maximum of 5%; something for which we have been asking for a long time. These are measures that are, at least, already being discussed and which some of us would like to be – and I repeat – mandatory.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are aware that both Commissioner Reding and the Spanish Presidency have repeatedly raised these issues, and we want to invite not only the rest of the groups but also other countries to understand that this is not just a whim, it is an obligation and a need and – I repeat – it is an opportunity in relation to the crisis that we are experiencing. In any case, I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work, the support and all the contributions made by the different groups so that this text could be a consensus and a compromise, and could clearly highlight the problem as well as what is and should be the solution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the report which I am presenting here is the result of collaboration under the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which also included a hearing with women’s organisations and experts, and participation by the European Commission itself. My thanks to everyone involved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">According to our analysis of the 2006-2010 Roadmap for Equality, we believe that some progress has been made, and prominence has been given to some key aspects of equality between women and men. In actual fact, however, they have not been fully realised because the political force needed has not been there.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is especially worth emphasising the inequalities that persist in real life, such as difficulties in accessing jobs with rights and decent wages, poverty, continuing discrimination and stereotypes which help to perpetuate inequalities, including access to training and professional advancement to leading positions, and in economic and political life. Existing contradictions in EU policy also contribute towards this, and have given rise to more than 85 million people in poverty, most of them women and children, as a result of unemployment, job insecurity, low wages, pensions below the minimum subsistence income, and poor access to quality public services.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The current economic and social crisis has particularly serious consequences for women, and this exacerbates inequalities and discrimination. This is the case with unequal pay between men and women, which is over 17% on average, and indirect discrimination, which tends to worsen when employment rises, affecting women and young girls.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The jobs created in recent years, particularly those for young people and women, have been largely insecure and poorly paid, without respecting basic rights, especially for maternity. This has also contributed to the low birth rate. The widespread discrimination to which specific groups of women are subjected is particularly serious. The groups worst affected are the elderly, women with dependents, immigrant women or those from a minority, and women with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Besides the high levels of poverty and unemployment, violence and discrimination have also contributed to the persistence and even the increase in trafficking of women and children and to prostitution in various EU countries. This requires an urgent response. Unfortunately, the proposals contained in the Europe 2020 strategy presented by the Commission did not deal with the gender perspective in a satisfactory way. We therefore hope that this situation will be revisited and that, above all, in developing the Strategy for Equality, the Commissioner will seek to respond to these issues. However, this goes beyond a single area of the European Commission, and there needs to be much greater involvement. Of the numerous measures outlined in the report, therefore, I would like to emphasise four areas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At institutional level, we propose that the new strategy on equality should be an agenda for action and a political commitment, based on the Beijing Platform for Action and the progress that it has made, and acknowledging that the human rights of women and girls are an unalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. We also advocate the Council’s adoption of the Commission’s new proposal on the Strategy for Equality, having consulted Parliament. This seeks to give equality policy greater political force and provide it with new impetus, as well as assigning Union funds to it, with a view to its effective achievement. We believe the annual tripartite meeting between the Council, the Commission and Parliament to be vital, as it looks into the progress of the strategy for gender equality in the European Union, along with an annual conference on gender equality involving women’s organisations and trade unions in various Member States, and, of course, MEPs and national MPs, paying particular attention to a predetermined theme every year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also like to draw your attention to the need to include the mainstreaming of the gender perspective during the preparation of all the proposals. Finally – I am about to conclude, Mr President – I would like to mention our insistence on the application and implementation of measures that have already been announced, be it the Institute for Equality, the Centre on Violence or the full application of existing directives, so that we can make the emancipation of women and their personal and professional fulfilment the central goal of our initiative and the strategy itself. Thank you very much. Please be sure to consider the recommendations that we have made here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the fact that the Commission has chosen to reiterate and strengthen its commitment to making equality between women and men a reality is a welcome development. The form chosen is a document entitled a ‘Women’s Charter’ presented on the occasion of International Women’s Day.</p>
      <p sl="en">This document follows the commitment made to the European Parliament by Commission President Barroso to produce a women’s charter, during discussions prior to his election for a second term in office. The document is additionally in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Platform for Action at the Beijing UN World Conference on Women and the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In summary, the document fills many roles and all of them important.</p>
      <p sl="en">How does the Commission envisage involving the other EU institutions, civil society and other stakeholders in this initiative?</p>
      <p sl="en">A recent Eurobarometer survey on gender equality showed that 62% of Europeans believe that gender inequality still exists in many areas of society. How will the Women’s Charter tackle this perception of inequality? How can the content of the Women’s Charter be translated into measurable goals and clear targets?</p>
      <p sl="en">As is customary, the Commission will continue to work on the basis of a five-year strategy for equality between women and men. The current road map covers the period 2006-2010. How will the Commission’s forthcoming five-year strategy for gender equality be linked to the Women’s Charter and how will the stakeholders be involved in this work?</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the future, the report clearly shows that our current problems include the need for more data and the fact that gender equality achievements are not assessed properly due to the lack of clear targets. If you are determined to obtain results, we need to evaluate the causes of inequality and assess the result of our actions. The report is about the assessment of the gender equality road map between 2006 and 2010 but, of course, we have to be more ambitious.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I would just like to mention the European protection order; we cannot wait any longer to give all women victims in Europe the best protection. Under the lead of the Spanish Presidency, I urge the Commission and the Council to come to a progressive and effective agreement as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, in a perfect world, we would not have needed to have this debate this evening. We would live in a society that was equal. Well, we do not live in a perfect world and that is why we are having this debate. However, it must not stop at a debate. Concrete measures are needed to boost women’s rights and for our work to promote gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A Charter for Women’s Rights, a charter that takes a comprehensive approach in all political areas, is something that is sorely needed. I think and believe that it is not enough to make statements and to utter fine words about equality. It is not enough to implement separate, isolated measures in different areas. No, the work on equality issues – the equality strategy, the report tabled by Mrs Figueiredo – needs to take a comprehensive approach, but we also need a comprehensive Charter for Women’s Rights.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In order to draw up such a charter, I believe that we need to make use of the knowledge, skills and experience that are also found outside Parliament. In women’s organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society in general, there are skills, knowledge and experience that we should utilise when drawing up a comprehensive charter.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission has the opportunity to start and coordinate a process between the EU institutions, national parliaments, NGOs and others to draw up such a charter. I am certain that, with the commitment shown by Mrs Reding to the work to promote equality, we have an opportunity to produce such a charter together with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I should also like to say that we often – ahead of every election to the European Parliament in any case – discuss how we can get more women to take part in parliamentary elections and how we can get more women involved in political decision making in general. In this regard, I believe that it is not enough for us to go out and urge women to take part in the elections. No, women, and our citizens in general, are more intelligent than that. They, of course, look at what we have done to change the reality of their lives and what we have done in Parliament to improve their circumstances and so on.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That is why we should now use this parliamentary term to show women in the EU and in the world that there is somewhere where we really do make a difference to the reality of life for most women.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Today, when we are evaluating the results that have been achieved from the road map for equality between women and men, while, at the same time, outlining future guidelines in this area, we must focus particular attention on the policies exerting a direct or indirect influence on gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We expect the European Commission to put forward a policy for women who have become victims of injustice, discrimination, hunger, poverty, human trafficking, as well as of any other forms of violence. We must take into account that even though gender equality is an absolute requirement for exercising fully our basic human rights and a fundamental principle of the European Union, inequalities persist in the political sphere and in women’s lives.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why it is particularly important for us to work on consolidating gender equality policies which offer an instrument for economic development and social cohesion. We must take into account the need for a new, socially sustainable model, which must integrate the full range of skills that women have to offer into the economy, restore the balance in terms of women’s and men’s responsibilities in public and private life, and guarantee such a work/life balance.</p>
      <p sl="bg">While examining the report on the road map for equality between women and men, the present oral question is particularly indicative of the European Parliament’s attitude to policies for promoting gender equality. I think that the Charter for Women’s Rights, followed later this year by a strategy on its enforcement, make it necessary for the progress achieved in this area over recent decades to be consolidated and for a stable European policy to be devised on creating a more complete society.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We expect the Commission to suggest measures to be included in the strategy for gender equality which guarantee specific legislative initiatives for tackling violence against women and legislative and non-legislative instruments for eliminating discrimination on the labour market, wage differentials and pushing women into unskilled work. Effective measures are also required to increase the employment rate and social gains for women as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as programmes for encouraging the involvement of women in the green economy, policies promoting greater representation for women in the managerial decision-making process, and lastly, suitable legislative amendments to get more women into management positions.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It is our common duty to raise awareness about women’s rights in Europe. I also believe that our united efforts will produce an effective European policy intended to promote gender equality, supported by proper strategies, enforcement measures and specific programmes. I wish to draw particular attention to the fact that, against the backdrop of a global economic crisis, the role of women in agriculture is becoming crucial.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Our joint actions aimed at removing the disparities in employment and getting more women involved in managing commercial companies and in every social sphere, in general, will guarantee positive results. Achieving gender equality will have a beneficial impact on productivity and economic growth, offering our societies numerous social and economic benefits.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We simply lack the ambition, Commissioner. We are reluctant to prove the European Parliament’s strength. We are accountable to our voters. They specify gender inequality as the number one unresolved problem in the European Union and we expect support from you so that we can work together on resolving this problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is almost a year since our new European Parliament was elected. It is almost half a year since Commissioner Reding was appointed. So we have four years left together to really make a difference for women and men. How we as a Parliament, and Ms Reding as Commissioner, are judged at the end of those four years will depend on the action that we take and on the support that we can muster in society.</p>
      <p sl="en">No one will be impressed by mere words. I do not want to have to say in four years’ time, ‘Look, this is a piece of paper from Ms Reding, and here is a huge stack of Parliament resolutions’. I want to be able to say, ‘Yes, we have secured two weeks’ paternity leave for all European fathers. Yes, we have adapted our equality laws to include all terrains, to include transgender people. Yes, we have a system in place that ensures gender parity for the next European Commission.’ I want to say, ‘Yes, the gender pay gap is closing, with more women with decent jobs and decent pay. And yes, the gender care gap is closing, with more men who take their share of unpaid care’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that all groups in this Parliament are united to deliver two strong reports tomorrow – the Figueiredo and the Romeva i Rueda reports – and I hope that Ms Reding will have the courage to turn these reports into action, even when there is not an easy majority in Council beforehand.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot do this alone. We need to involve those to whom this is important. I am not too happy with how the Women’s Charter up to now has been drafted, with no involvement of Parliament or of civil society, but I will accept that this is the way that the European Commission has made an opening statement to lay down its commitment to gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is more important what happens next. In answer to our questions, I would very much like to hear from Ms Reding how she will draft an ambitious strategy for our coming four years.</p>

    <intervention id="2-594" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Isabel Martínez Lozano" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Good evening, Mr President. I would like to express my thanks for the opportunity to participate in this debate with the honourable Members this evening. On behalf of the current Presidency of the Council, I wish to congratulate you on these reports that you have presented to us this evening. There is no doubt that they clearly set out the problems of European women, the problems that we are facing in these difficult times and the challenges that we must tackle as politicians over the next few years.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have been working on these matters – these problems that you have highlighted here this afternoon – for the last six months on behalf of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, and for some years before that on behalf of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Indeed, I have dedicated, as I say, part of my work, part of the work of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, to working on the gender perspective of the new growth and employment strategy, the EU 2020 strategy, which will foreseeably be adopted this Thursday, 17 July. This is undoubtedly a crucial instrument that is going to mark all of our policies over the next decade.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition to incorporating the gender perspective into this strategy, I have also sought to place the fight against gender violence at the top of the agenda. The fact is that this issue, which undoubtedly reflects the cruellest aspect of inequality, remains a serious social problem in all our Member States, as is also acknowledged in the reports that have just been presented.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thus, we have adopted some conclusions that advance the goals and instruments of the Commission and the Member States in eradicating violence against women. The text that has been adopted commits the 27 Member States, as well as the Commission, to developing common initiatives and instruments to tackle jointly the blot that is violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="es">One of these conclusions is the drawing up of a European strategy to prevent and combat gender violence. Indeed, the Commission has already started work on this strategy, the primary aim of which must be to acquire information that can be compared on a European scale, to establish common objectives and the resources to meet them, and to take the first steps towards setting up a European watchdog on gender violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, as regards violence, you are aware that these conclusions also proposed setting up a free helpline for victims of gender violence, in addition to a series of measures that will serve to strengthen the social protection of women victims. We have also asked the Commission to study the legal basis for possible new legislative instruments to enable us to combat these offences more effectively in all our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the other hand, on 7 June last, equality once again became a subject of European debate at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, because of the adoption of the employment policy guidelines for Member States. As I have just said, they will be brought before the European Council on 17 June. These guidelines include equality between men and women as an essential factor, not only in restoring employment in the current climate of economic crisis, but also in putting into practice the new, intelligent, sustainable and integrating growth model for the next decade. That is because what must also be sustainable is a social model that has to look after a population that is expected to age considerably over the next 20 years, and the care of this population cannot be allowed to continue to fall exclusively into the voluntary hands of women.</p>
      <p sl="es">If one thing has become clear from these preliminary considerations on the reports that you have presented, and from all the discussions we have had during the course of our Presidency, it is that, if we want to rebuild growth on a sound basis, Europe needs to be able to count on the potential, the capacity and the knowledge of all of its citizens, including all of its women. In spite of being the majority among those who gain higher-education degrees in the European Union (60%), women do not manage to develop their full potential owing to certain structures in our production systems, which are as unfair as they are inefficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to overcome all these inequalities in our labour markets, which represent a genuine obstacle to collective progress, the target of a 75% employment rate by 2020 will have to take both men and women into account. It is not merely a question of fairness. If we compare the employment rates for men and women in the European Union, it can be seen that 76% of the former have a job, while the percentage of working women stands at 63%. Consequently, a special effort will have to be made in this respect over the next few years in order to have a greater number of women join the labour market. As we have agreed, this increase of women on the labour market will also have to be brought about, as Mr Romeva i Rueda pointed out, by taking action on the pay gap, which last year reached an average of practically 18% in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Other questions concerning gender equality, which will form part of this EU 2020 strategy, must also be highlighted, such as overcoming gender stereotypes in education, as well as in vocational and academic guidance. We know that such stereotypes are currently leading to a segregated labour market, as well as the need to seek a balance between work and private life.</p>
      <p sl="es">As far as social inclusion and the fight against poverty is concerned, a topic of tremendous importance, Mrs Figueiredo, we have also paid special attention to the case of women, given that they run a greater risk of poverty than men as a result of receiving lower wages and pensions and as a result of assuming responsibility, on their own, for unpaid care work.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are also greatly pleased with having reached an agreement with Parliament concerning the proposal for a directive on equal treatment for self-employed men and women. This agreement will make it possible to adopt this directive at a forthcoming Council meeting. It is a directive that will acknowledge new rights for self-employed women and their collaborating spouses or partners.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I have said, we have held several meetings at which we have discussed options and proposals about the problems that we are debating here today. Finally, and no doubt Commissioner Reding will refer to this, we have also discussed the future 2011-2015 strategy for gender equality, a subject that will doubtlessly give rise to intense debate in this House over the coming months and for which the Commission will present a road map in the next few months.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am convinced, and with this I will conclude, Mr President, that the debate on the crisis and economic recovery must not make us stray from strengthening our European social model. That would be a mistake. It would be a great mistake at this moment in time, and that is why I believe that it is important to keep alive these debates and policies on equality, which, over so many years, have enabled us not only to grow, but to grow and maintain an enviable and impeccable social cohesion model.</p>

I agree with you because, actually, we know what we want and we know why we want it. We know that the only way for our society to advance is to have gender equality, not only in women’s affairs but horizontally.</p>
      <p sl="en">That was exactly the reason why, for the first time in its history, the Commission started its five-year mandate with an opening statement, as it has been called, with a Charter which is a political commitment of each member of the Commission to advance equality between men and women within his or her portfolio and thus, a commitment by the Commission as a whole to have gender equality high on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is one thing. The second thing is: how do we get the action? How do we put the flesh on the bones of this Women’s Charter which the Commission pledged itself to in March? Here we come to the implementation. Firstly, I have asked all my fellow Commissioners to provide an input into the strategy, so it will not only be the Commissioner speaking to you now who is responsible for gender equality, but it will also be the other 26 Commissioners who will put on the table their contributions in their specific departments and responsibilities. This is very important because it has never happened before, and I believe that it is in the spirit of what all the political groups have presented here.</p>
      <p sl="en">How did we come up with these ideas? The five priorities in the Charter have not appeared out of the blue. They reflect the result of the broad stakeholder consultation we conducted in 2009 in preparation for the new strategy. I will come back to the strategy later on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first speak about the very important reports that have been presented by the European Parliament. First, Mr Romeva i Rueda’s report. It is line with the Commission’s position on how the crisis affects women and how responses to it should take into account the impact on women. I have already drawn attention to this issue in the latest annual report on equality between women and men, underlining that this crisis affects women more than the previous recessions did because women now participate more in paid employment and are often at the weak end of the job chain. At the beginning of the crisis, we saw that male unemployment was rising very strongly, mostly because of the problems in construction and in industry. Now we see that the unemployment of men and women is rising at the same level and the risk is that due to public budget costs and – hopefully not too much, but also – cuts in spending on gender equality, this will certainly have an impact on women’s employment. So it is very important that we are aware of this and that we have to put measures forward. That is why I am firmly supporting efforts to incorporate gender equality considerations into recovery measures. I believe that the crisis is a unique opportunity to implement the policies which will make the labour market and our society more gender-equal in the future. It has been already said very clearly by the Presidency that the employment rate of 75%, which is our goal, cannot be obtained if we do not have women participating.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the gender perspectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the three main elements of this, nothing can be obtained without women. Women make up 60% of university graduates and we do not ‘utilise’ them in the labour market but, if we are going for the smart growth, the green economy where we need the minds and where we cannot leave those very well trained intellectual women aside, we will never reach our goals without women. That is why I believe that women need to be helped in order for the 2020 strategy to have a positive result. The targets cannot be reached if we do not significantly improve the inclusion of women in the labour market. That is why I think it is very good that the European Parliament has constantly underlined the strong gender dimension of the strategy – rightly so because we really need to ensure that women contribute to the strategy and also reap the benefits of the strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our gender equality strategy, which I will present in the autumn of this year, will contain many very concrete elements – not for the next few months but for the next years. We will have to have a real road map regarding how we want to implement the very concrete elements between 2010 and the end of our mandate – your mandate as European parliamentarians and my mandate as European Commissioner. The strategy will therefore aim to improve governance and policy dialogue and will be implemented in close cooperation with the main partners at European level. Something which was said in this Chamber, and which is absolutely right, is that we could write a gender equality strategy now, but they must be put into practice in the Member States. We see how all the instruments of the stakeholders which have been constructed over the years – since the Beijing Platform – are functioning well. In times of crisis, we have to see that they continue to function well and that nobody will try to eliminate them. I count on Parliament to help. If something like this occurred to a government, I am sure that we would at once speak up in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this cooperation on which the ideas of the future strategy have been built – as I said at the beginning, it was the stakeholders who came in on the public consultation on this – has to be brought to a fruitful dialogue and what you call for – a regular dialogue. I therefore underline the report on the new strategy drafted by Mrs Figueiredo. I think your idea, rapporteur, of an annual tripartite meeting between Parliament, Council and Commission to review what we have done in the course of the action is an excellent one. I think it will be very good to take it up because it will give everybody an incentive – the Commission, Council and also Parliament – to do more to help. Such a gender equality dialogue could be based on the annual report on gender equality drafted by the European Commission. I think that could be a very active and concrete way to proceed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also count on the Member States to support the Commission’s action in the area of gender equality, first by endorsing the new strategy, of course, after having heard what Parliament has to say about the proposals I will put on the table at the end of September, and also by renewing the EU Pact for Gender Equality.</p>
      <p sl="en">In summary, there are three areas in which I want EU action to be very effective and very tangible, although when I speak of three areas, that does not mean that they are the only three areas, but I think we could perhaps make out of those three areas our main goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, we will have to take decisive action to tackle violence against women and ensure effective protection of victims. Our common judicial area must be an area where victims feel treated with dignity, respect and a high standard of protection and support, not only in one domain but in many domains. I have made it a priority to ensure that in the first half of 2011, the Commission presents a comprehensive package in that respect. I know that the Belgian Presidency wants to take stock of what has already been done, what is in the pipeline and what needs to be done in an important conference which will take place some time in November. There will be a progression from the preparatory work done under the Spanish Presidency, the stocktaking and the preparation for complementary actions in the autumn, and then a comprehensive package at the beginning of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to reconfirm what I said during my hearing and what has been clearly said also in the Commission’s Charter: the Commission will use all possible instruments, including criminal law if needed, to eradicate female genital mutilation. We believe that this is a brutal practice which can, under no circumstances and with no excuses, continue to be a reality in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will also be preparing a legal instrument to enhance the participation of women in decision making. You are right: women are, except in university studies, severely under-represented in decision-making positions at all levels, both in public and in private companies. Europe will have to act to close that gap as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that I have not spoken about all the other elements, such as the various kinds of leave we might add to maternity leave, the targets on child care facilities, the pay gap and the options we have in order to introduce more transparency on these problems. The labels, the charters, the award and so on are all going to be on the agenda; all of this will be on the table at the end of September.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding those concrete actions, you should then really come in and say that this is nonsense, this is not strong enough and say what you think we need on them. We are working on this together with my collaborators. We have heard the input of all the stakeholders. We have seen the input of your reports, of your resolutions and we have got the input from the Ministers who have been meeting in a very important conference during the Spanish Presidency. Altogether, I think we will manage so that you will say, four years from now, ‘Yes, we have done it’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, despite the achievements of the EU gender equality policies in the last half century, which we have talked about today, there is still a lot to accomplish, as many speakers have said. The ambitious goals of the 2006 and 2010 EU road map – and many of the MEPs were here at the time when we were talking to the Commission about the older road map – where we called for economic independence, reconciliation of private life and professional life, equal representation, eradication of violence, elimination of stereotypes and the promotion of gender equality in external policies, need to be further pursued. We can all see this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fulfilling the aims of the old road map and defining the objectives of the new road map, to which this debate and all the reports should have pointed, we see that the Commission needs to introduce specific measures in order to assure the strength of the existing road map, and also to learn from its weaknesses and to overcome these weaknesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">My main concern is the visibility, the visible influence that we can have on national and regional level instruments achieving gender equality in the field. Although, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, it is still difficult to assess the financial crisis, it is absolutely clear to all of us that this period has had particularly serious consequences for women.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore very much the case, and should be highlighted endlessly, that inadequate investment in economic and social opportunities for women completely limits economic growth and slows down the reduction of poverty and social disparities in our Europe. Beside this, what was missing from the old road map – actually it was talked about but not much was done – is combating multiple discrimination, since compound discrimination based on age, disability, ethnic or racial background, religion or national origin and social economic status creates multiple barriers to women’s empowerment and social advancement. This is something we do not talk about very much. Just as rarely do we talk about the importance of collecting, processing and publishing disaggregated data. Finally, primarily tools …</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Martínez Lozano, in a recent article published in Time , entitled The New Sheriffs of Wall Street , it states that in the US, women do not run Wall Street, nor are they to blame for this financial crisis, but that, in the face of the situation brought about through the lack of regulation of financial market, it is they who are now being called upon and appointed to positions of leadership in order to clean up the mess caused by their male managers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is interesting. The men caused the crisis and the women will have to resolve it. Putting irony aside, the global economy is facing the worst recession since the Great Depression. It has had social repercussions throughout the European Union and the worst effects of it have fallen on women, as they are subject to greater job insecurity, more prone to dismissal and less likely to be covered by social security systems. In this context, there are well-founded fears that many Member States might reduce funding for the social sector, once again affecting predominantly women. It is not fair that the most vulnerable are those who have to pay for the mistakes of the speculators.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to conclude by congratulating the Spanish Presidency for giving priority to combating gender-based violence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank both rapporteurs and tell them that my group will wholeheartedly endorse both reports because they deal with a very important issue, gender equality, the importance of which I think is also demonstrated by the rich choice of subjects covered by both reports.</p>
      <p sl="de">But, colleagues, I have to say that I am a little bit frustrated because, if we claim that we want action, that we want to achieve something in the next four years, that this is an issue of the highest priority, that half the population is being discriminated against and half the potential remains unused, then how come we are having this debate in the last evening slot? Where are the group leaders? Why do we accept that this is not the highest priority? I suggest, colleagues, that we insist that, next time, this issue should be included in the agenda as a key debate and unless they grant us that, we could chain ourselves to the door. I do not think we should accept this any more.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, tonight’s debate looks at ways to improve a woman’s lot; sometimes by positive discrimination such as quotas, sometimes by direct legislation on gender equality. I support references strengthening cooperation between Member States in addressing wage discrimination for equal jobs and action protecting women and men against all forms of violence, including human trafficking and female genital mutilation, but we also need to see strong steps towards empowerment of women through increasing confidence in their abilities, through education and through moves to create an environment which encourages choice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Someone who once lived under the cloud of discrimination said: I have a dream. Well, I too have a dream. I look to the day that we will work, not only for greater equality in the workplace, but to empower women to make a free choice and to feel strong enough to achieve their goals. That would be the true road map for women. However, we must take small steps. We all agree on the principle of equality and I would say it is our basic right, but why include issues which muddy the water? The dossiers are complex and the inclusion of issues which are Member State competences, such as public expenditure in the area of health, does not help matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are red lines in the road. I am sorry to say that, if we are to achieve equality, we must ensure the road is clear of distractions for it is only on a clear road that we can march forward united.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to point out that a great deal of words have been heard, but that we have heard little about the ‘wherefore’. In this sense, I consider that the two reports are, at best, wish lists, especially the report which refers to the impact of the crisis. I say that because, unfortunately, they do not address the problems which this unacceptable situation has caused for women.</p>
      <p sl="el">In my opinion, if today, in Greece, the retirement age is increased from between 5 to 17 years for women, that is due both to the capitalist system and to the 2020 strategy, which is not being contested. I fail to see how the Commissioner can speak of different equality measures for women when she does not contest this strategy.</p>
      <p sl="el">Whatever measure you take, Commissioner, you cannot overturn the 2020 strategy, because you have hardly even contested it. For that reason, we consider that the solution to the problem can only be found through the fight by women, through the fight by all the workers against the consequences of the crisis, through the fight to overturn capitalism.</p>

They should not, under any circumstances, be used as arguments for dismantling the progress we have achieved so far with regard to gender equality. In the medium term, this might further harm economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">The pay gap between men and women remains and, I am afraid, this is still the case throughout the whole of Europe. Taking the European average, the income gap sets men and women 17.8% apart. In this regard however, there are, unfortunately, also some negative anomalies, like Austria, my home country. The current Report on Women by the Austrian Federal Government shows that women earn a mere 58.4% of the gross wage of men. Only in two countries is this income gap even wider. It has to be our general aim to break this glass ceiling and it should finally become a thing of the past.</p>

However, I am not particularly thrilled about the fact that the majority of women, at least in Hungary, my home country, are not aware of their rights and cannot enforce them. This is the situation which calls for urgent measures. One of the reasons behind their inability to enforce their rights is the fact that they cannot afford a solicitor. What solutions do I have in mind? We need specially trained solicitors, a free legal aid service and a website with answers to the everyday legal problems women encounter. What legal problems are these? For instance, a woman who has not received child maintenance payments for months needs information on what to do, whom to contact for help. A woman who is physically abused by her husband, who calls the police only to be told that this is a family affair and they cannot intervene, needs to find out if the officers are right or if she can find help, and from whom. A woman who has three children and is rejected for the twentieth time at a job interview for made-up reasons should be able to find out if she has a chance for legal redress.

      <p sl="cs">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is undoubtedly a gender aspect to the economic slowdown and the financial crisis. There is a risk that the inequalities we are wrestling with will grow deeper. Pay differences, pressure on labour law, maternity-related social protection and conditions on the labour market are just a few examples.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The crisis-related budget cuts in various States are an unavoidable reality. They affect mainly public services and the availability of these services. Cost-cutting measures do not greatly affect most of the powerful departments of state. Savings therefore focus on those areas where the least resistance is expected from the parties affected by the cuts, relying on the fact that people will cope, because there is simply no alternative. Caring for children and elderly parents remains a duty under all circumstances. It is overwhelmingly women who have to take on this role.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Reductions in funding for social services, which mainly employ women, also come top of the list of cost-cutting measures.

      <p sl="ro">The gender aspects of the economic crisis, the road map for gender equality and the Charter for Women’s Rights are three topics with a common denominator: the status of women in society. If we really want to improve the status of women in society, we need specific policies and measures like those also presented by the Charter of Women’s Rights as proposed under the S&amp;D manifesto.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If we really need women to be better represented in the decision-making structures in both the public and private sectors, introducing gender equality in Europe’s institutions is an absolute must. I believe that the European Parliament and the European Commission must set an example in this respect in 2014, through making a commitment and showing strong political will.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think it is disappointing that in the year 2010, we are still talking about women’s rights, notwithstanding the great progress made by the European Union, especially in trying to get equal pay for equal work.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to highlight the lack of women’s rights particularly in the third world. I worked as a volunteer in Malawi for a few months and I was appalled at the treatment of women there. Firstly, they did most of the hard work in the fields while the men loafed around the place, and secondly, the sexual entitlements of some of those men, especially a guy known as ‘The Hyena’, were absolutely abhorrent.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is time that the European Union made development aid to these countries conditional on eliminating some of these appalling practices. The NGOs could highlight it too a bit more than they are doing. I look forward to a women’s rights charter here in Europe which can hopefully become a model to be implemented right throughout the world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs – whom I thank – have raised a key issue, which Commissioner Reding has also addressed in part. We must ensure that policies for women and for equal opportunities are incorporated and integrated more effectively into general policies at European and national level alike. I am thinking of the crisis, poverty, development, cooperation, employment and welfare.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe, however, that there are three issues that should be emphasised by the Commission, by us in our work and by the Member States. Firstly, I would like Commissioner Reding to emphasise the role of women in the European Union’s external action. A new policy of which women must be made more aware is contained in Mrs Figueiredo’s report. The second issue is that of the Commission’s support for the draft directive on the European Protection Order, which is a tool of fundamental importance for guaranteeing the …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in recent years and decades, the European Union has been at the vanguard of equal treatment of women and men. We need to expand Europe’s vanguard role. In the Women’s Charter presented by the Commission, I see an indispensable contribution towards equality between women and men in the European Union. However, the efforts made towards strengthening a woman’s role in the economy, equal pay and increasing the appointment of women to decision-making posts must not just remain empty words. We must back them up with action. Above all, we need to make greater efforts to convince male decision makers of our concerns. Women’s issues are society’s issues and concern everyone. However, we must put a stop to the discrimination of women, both within and outside our society, and we must take decisive action on this front.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis, which has become an economic and, finally, a social crisis, has had disastrous consequences on the positive developments that had been made to date in the field of equality between men and women.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Whether we are talking about unemployment rates or wage gaps, it is clear that women are suffering more from the consequences of the crisis, because they are often in a far more vulnerable position than men. That is why it is important for us to set clear short-, medium- and long-term objectives, for us to put specific measures in place which attack urgent problems and for us to provide real resources for our actions and ambitions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The submitted report is highly detailed and of a very high quality, which must be applauded.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to focus on certain specific points which are typical of post-communist countries in particular, because state support was provided in these countries particularly to sectors of a masculine nature, or sectors which are male domains, especially the car industry, which is export-oriented and is mainly a male domain. In contrast to this, for example, sectors where most of the workers were women were not supported in that way by governments.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It should also be emphasised that the post-communist countries are of a persistently semi-industrial nature, and it is therefore very difficult to find an opportunity to support precisely those sectors where most of the employees are women. We are also anticipating very heavy cuts for the social area in particular in post-communist countries, and it will be women that are most affected by this. It is therefore also necessary to focus on this element, and to look for a solution in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">We should make sure that we always include and take into account the equality issue in all reports that we discuss here in Parliament.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I could comment on many of the issues we have debated but, with regard to the crisis, I would like to say that we should focus on making sure that the burden of this crisis is not carried on the backs of women.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we talk about consolidation in all national parliaments, including in this House, then this consolidation should not be at the expense of the socially vulnerable, nor at the expense of women in general. If we now start cutting corners to the detriment of social services, education and training and, above all, child care, then that will have implications for the future and for the livelihoods of women. In other words, the concern I am trying to put across to you is that, in the Europe 2020 strategy, we should emphatically re-introduce the issue of gender mainstreaming and make sure that gender budgeting becomes a matter of course in the future, because only then will we be able to ensure that we can implement in Europe everything that we are wishing and calling for today, in the future as well.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, a lot of interesting things have been said here this evening. I would like to congratulate you on your contributions and on these ideas, which, without a doubt, also have a lot to do with proposals to emerge from the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner Reding said that we already have a lot of documents and that the time has now come to take action, something with which I fully agree. I think this is what civil society has been asking governments to do since 1995: that we begin to take action. Taking action means continuing to work towards real equality, and doing so, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, with imagination and political will. True equality means improving the life of women, making their daily lives better, making men and women live better lives from day to day.</p>
      <p sl="es">Seeing the crisis as an opportunity is something that has been repeated a lot this evening. I agree with this statement. I agree that the crisis also affords us opportunities. For some, it is already proving to be an opportunity, but we must not overlook the fact that there are also risks and backward steps.</p>
      <p sl="es">As far as the equality issue is concerned, there have always been forward and backward steps, something that we women know only too well. There have never been forward steps that were not accompanied by backward ones. For that very reason, in order to prevent such backward steps, I believe that it is important that we do not abandon European consensus, that we do not lose sight of the road map that has enabled us to make so much progress together over recent years. Nor should we, the Member States, stray from the road map. As the Commissioner so rightly said, it is very important that we always remain true to the Commission’s recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am finishing; I will not go on much longer. I believe that we cannot leave the marks of our identity or the coherence of our policies behind; those same policies have enabled us to show our better side to the whole world. I agree with Mrs Figueiredo that in the future, in order to work along this line, we have to strengthen coordination with the Council, coordination with the Commission, and coordination with the European Parliament, and, of course, we always have to keep an eye on civil society’s demands.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to congratulate the House on the debate and the reports that have been presented to it this evening. The Spanish Presidency of the Council has 15 days left before it hands over to the Belgian Presidency. We have endeavoured not to let the issue of equality be overlooked at such a politically complicated and complex time as the time we are dealing with at present. It goes without saying that we in the Spanish Government shall continue to work on placing equality at the top of the European Union agenda.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to begin by referring to that feeling of frustration mentioned by my fellow Member Mrs in ’t Veld, which is evidently felt by all of us. However, it is also obvious, as we have seen, that this is, at least for us, an essential, important and crucial issue. That is how we experience it, and will continue to pursue it until some chairs of political groups, be they male or female, understand that this must be regarded as a priority issue, and not simply an end-of-the-evening debate.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second question I feel it important to underline has been expressed in several different ways by fellow Members, namely that equality is not a mere whim or a superfluous expense, but rather an investment. In addition to being a necessary investment, it is also a right.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is something that we need to bear in mind when debating questions of this nature. We have to understand that, when faced with a crisis situation like the one we are currently going through, investing and devoting effort, time, political will and money to equality is something that demands not only all our ingenuity, but also, clearly, all our political will and our closest attention.</p>
      <p sl="es">The third question I wish to address very briefly as well is my belief that it is important to underline the fact that, in order for us to achieve the 75% employment target by 2020, not only for men, but for women as well, it is important to understand that this means adopting active measures to promote and encourage women to play a larger role in the public sphere, and also measures to encourage and oblige men to play a larger role in the private sphere. Achieving one without the other is impossible. It is important that we understand in our policies that they are two sides of the same coin. If not, we are clearly going to oblige women, once again, to do those two extra days’ work.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fourth and last question I also feel to be of importance is to take care not to use the crisis to make cutbacks where it is least necessary to do so. We know that it is precisely in the Spanish Ministry of Equality where we currently have the lowest budgets. The threat of cutbacks there would imply that this is not a priority area. That would be a serious mistake and I believe it important that the rest of the European Union Member States not only understand the importance of such a ministry, but even copy it as a model for their own countries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would also like to stress that, although this debate is being held at night, it has seen a significant level of participation from MEPs, which is unusual for a debate at this hour. Such participation, in spite of the unfavourable conditions in which the debate is taking place, makes this a victory in the fight for women’s rights and equality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, I would also like to say that the speeches that have been heard today generally point out concrete actions and ideas which we must now put into practice. All of those here can rise to this challenge and put them into practice. Lastly, I believe that this strengthening of political will to put the proposals, words and promises into practice is something that I would like to be preserved as a very positive aspect of tonight’s debate. This increased political will, whether in all the policies of the EU and the Member States, or in specific actions to give greater visibility to women so that equality is achieved along with social progress, makes this a key contribution, and we hope that four years from now – as the Commissioner has said – we can achieve a positive balance out of the work that we have carried out, with Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would therefore like to conclude by saying that with this increased political will and attention to women’s dreams and aspirations, we can make an important contribution to their emancipation and to making their dreams come true. This must take the form of personal and professional fulfilment, through consideration of each of their lives, with work, jobs with rights, participation in social life, and, where applicable, in economic and political life, and with greater fulfilment within their families.</p>

      <p sl="ro">EU ministers for social affairs have acknowledged that 120 million European citizens live below the poverty line. Compared to the statistics dating from before the economic crisis was unleashed, we are facing in the EU a 50% rise in the number of poor in just two years. The recession has exacerbated a steady trend during the last decade: the number of women affected by poverty is much higher than that for men. Unemployment, working in unsafe conditions, pension levels lower than the minimum subsistence income and difficulties in accessing decent public services are some of the main causes of the state of poverty whose nature justifies us talking about the feminisation of poverty in Europe. Unfortunately, numerous right-wing governments have abandoned their policies combating the gender gap, under the pretext of the recession. The budgets for care services and leave provision have been particularly hard hit, which has serious, adverse repercussions, including on children. As we reach the halfway point in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, the assessment is negative. In fact, the future looks gloomy when there is little time devoted, both at government level in many Member States and at European institution level, to the concern for, and the desire to improve, the lives of those hardest hit among our fellow human beings.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Eliminating any form of discrimination in every sphere of social and economic life is a vital prerequisite for protecting human rights and the welfare of every citizen. The promotion of the principle of equal opportunities for men and women, along with ensuring greater involvement by women in economic and social life, as participants enjoying full rights, must be constant issues of concern. I believe that this approach must be reflected in the common agricultural policy in order to ensure that the sexes are represented fairly and equally. On the other hand, this approach may ensure the effectiveness of implementing various policies at European level. I believe that gender equality in the economy is extremely important for rural development and that the measures being implemented as part of Pillar 2 on this issue must also be retained in the future CAP. Bearing in mind that the principle of gender equality is promoted by European legislation and is a fundamental requirement of the Europe 2020 strategy, we consider it appropriate to include this issue in the future CAP, which also means through using new instruments which will promote this principle.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The principle of gender equality is not being pursued effectively. According to Spanish Member Mrs Valenciano, cows are better protected in the EU than women. We suffer discrimination in every area of life. We earn 18% less than men, we are more often unemployed and we are underrepresented in politics, public life and business. Most lamentable of all is the fact that women cannot benefit fully even from fundamental rights. In relation to women, the right to life and personal integrity, as well as reproductive rights, are violated significantly more often. For example, in Poland, the restriction of human rights is tolerated in relation to women. In 1997, the President of the Constitutional Tribunal, in justifying rejection of liberalisation of the right to abortion, considered it obvious that a pregnant woman must be deprived of some of her civil rights. Not only did this not end his career, but it strengthened his position as a ‘moral authority’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The gender question must find significant reflection in the Union budget. The economic crisis must not be the cause of restrictions on measures for equality between men and women. Only a consistent, long-term political strategy can bring results. Just promoting equal treatment of the sexes and passing anti-discrimination laws is not enough. Legislation does not automatically generate equality. What is needed is work from the bottom up, building the social awareness and solidarity of women. Improving the situation of women requires a fight against stereotypes and discriminatory practices and the elimination of male chauvinists from public life.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation of women in the labour market before the crisis was not satisfactory. However, it was improving, despite difficult and perpetually unsolved problems such as differences in pay for the same work and under representation in managerial positions in business. These positive trends should not be left out of the discussion. A report from the Commission shows that since 1995, the contribution of women to economic growth in the EU has increased by a quarter, and that the female employment rate increased by 7.1% over the last decade and reached 59.1%. As a result of the crisis, unemployment is rising faster among women than among men. Women are employed, principally, in the public sector, so they are directly at risk from redundancies made due to cost-cutting policies. The anti-crisis mechanisms which are being applied are aimed at a quick return to employment mainly of people who lost their jobs as a direct result of the crisis, which ignores, for the time being, people who are permanently out of work. Forced by personal circumstances, women currently are more often taking work in part-time jobs which offer little job security. Aware of all these dangers, let us try to apply horizontal solutions in order to maintain the level of employment from before the crisis and not allow a downward trend.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, in 150 years, the Baltic Sea has gone from an untouched, clear, oligotrophic Arctic sea to one in a constant state of crisis. The problems of eutrophication, algal blooms, toxic waste and threatened biodiversity are growing ever greater. The situation in the Baltic Sea is very serious. Despite successful attempts in the 1990s and 2000s to reduce the input of nitrogen and phosphorus, almost the whole of the Baltic Sea is currently suffering the effects of eutrophication. Similarly, the levels of environmental toxins and heavy metals are high, despite success in reducing the discharge of lead, mercury and DDT, for example.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I do not know whether any of you have seen the algal bloom in this large, previously healthy, inland sea. If you go out in a boat in the wonderful archipelago in summer, you are met by a decimetre-thick green, foul-smelling layer of algae. If dogs drink the water they die, and if children bathe in it they vomit and suffer an upset stomach. That is the situation in many places around the Baltic Sea today. In order to safeguard growth and enable our rural communities to thrive in the future too, it is vital that we increase our knowledge of the impact on the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The ecosystem of the Baltic Sea area is complex and impossible to understand without cooperation between researchers across borders throughout the whole of the catchment area into this inland sea. A great deal of research along these lines is already being carried out, but often without adequate coordination. The proposal that we have on the table today – which is referred to as BONUS for short – aims to change this. This work will be a joint research programme between the states surrounding the Baltic Sea, including, in fact, researchers from Russia, in order to meet the environmental challenges in this area. BONUS will create a strategic plan with a common focus for more than 500 researchers from the eight Member States around the Baltic. The EU and the states in the Baltic Sea area will then, together, invest nearly SEK 1 billion in environmental research.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Eighty five million people live around the Baltic Sea in countries whose economies are dependent on the sea in various ways. At the same time, it is our societies that are contributing to the problems as discharges and waste find their way out into the water. A better overall view of the research is needed if it is to be possible to save the Baltic Sea. Research in this area is fragmented and far too dependent on the limited research appropriations at local, regional and national level.</p>
      <p sl="sv">BONUS builds instead on experience gained from the EU’s Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development. As a result of BONUS, the national research programmes and activities in the participating states will, for the first time, be integrated into a joint strategic programme with a clear focus.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to thank everyone – my fellow Members, the Spanish Presidency and the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science – who has been involved in making this happen. This type of coordinated investment in environmental research is one element in the creation of a sustainable, dynamic and resource-efficient Europe. The Baltic Sea is very much alive in the culture of all eight of our countries surrounding this inland sea: in their literature, music and art. We want it to still be here for our grandchildren. BONUS will form part of the platform for this investment in the future.</p>

I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their constructive support and I would like to acknowledge the supportive opinion of the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety concerning the BONUS programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Eight of the nine states bordering the Baltic Sea are members of the European Union, and we are all aware of the very complex and pressing environmental problems currently being faced in the Baltic Sea, which were outlined very eloquently by Ms Ek a few moments ago. These ever-increasing pressures are today threatening the capacity of the Baltic Sea region to continue to provide the diverse range of goods and services upon which we have all learned to depend. Science has a very important role to play in supporting public policy in the research and environmental sectors. However, the fragmentation of the European research system and the lack of coordination and coherence among its national components undermine its cost effectiveness and overall performance.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is indeed the challenge that we face in the Baltic Sea region. It is clear that no individual Baltic Sea state acting alone can be successful in solving the complex environmental issues in this area. To tackle the environmental problems in the Baltic Sea, it is now a matter of urgency to develop a strategic and integrated research strategy for the region, enable cross-border synergies, pool resources, share knowledge and enhance the cross-border mobility of researchers. This is how we can ensure a sustainable future for the Baltic Sea region. The BONUS initiative, together with the efforts made within the framework of the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region, will provide the structure and the means to address these challenges in an effective and coordinated manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the institutional agreement that was reached with regard to the implementation of the BONUS initiative on 27 April last. Having said this, I would also like to stress my regret at the lack of agreement among the Member States to put in place a real common-pot model, as set out in the original European Commission proposal. Without having a real common-pot financing facility, the selection of the best transnational research proposals based strictly on scientific excellence, the quality of the consortium and the expected impact cannot be fully guaranteed. It does not allow for the full realisation of the benefits, added value and efficiency gains of cross-border collaboration. For this reason, the European Commission would like to stress that the implications of this decision should not be taken as a precedent for future proposals. Member States will need to commit to a real common pot for cross-border funding and collaboration before the launch of any further initiatives based on Article 185 of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">To come back to this current initiative, the European Commission has every confidence that the BONUS programme will be in a position to optimise the potential of environmental research programmes in the Baltic Sea region, enhance the scientific capacity of the area, facilitate cross-border mobility of researchers, promote synergies and avoid wasteful duplication of research efforts. This will secure a sustainable future for the Baltic Sea.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, BONUS-169 is an important pilot project and it is about cooperation on environmental problems in a particular area. The programme is supported, in general, by all of the Baltic States. The programme is also intended to include non-EU countries that discharge their waste water and thereby pollute the Baltic Sea, which is considered to be one of the most polluted seas in the world. The BONUS programme has an enormous task to do in bringing to light the many environmental problems in the Baltic Sea. All the various types of pollution in the world, from paper factories and similar industries, as well as collapsing fish stocks, threaten the Baltic Sea, and undetonated mustard gas bombs and Russian gas pipelines do not help to promote the welfare of the ecosystem. I am therefore very much in favour of the BONUS programme. However, it must not stand alone, but must instead be accompanied by the environmental awareness of the individual States together with action on their part; including the provision of financial resources.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, rapporteur Mrs Ek, the particular problems and the special situation of the Baltic Sea call for a special approach. Therefore, I am delighted that we can wind things up with an agreement at this time and that the work can begin. Nevertheless, I should like to share a few reflections.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As the Commissioner has already said, we have gone for a real common pot in the first instance, a common fund to which criteria such as excellence and interdisciplinary approach apply. The consultations produced a rather pragmatic approach, which is that countries themselves may also shop around on the list of projects so as to get their own universities and institutions on board. I do not have any objection to that per se – indeed, I am in agreement – but we do have to assess it. This must be done efficiently and, if it is done right, and cooperation is more successful than in the past, it may well be an example of what we are looking for in the EU 2020 strategy. Europe pays a little extra and the Member States pay extra. We are talking about not only research itself but also the subsequent implementation. Environmental quality must also be restored effectively, so let us keep a close eye on that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to make two more comments. Firstly, the approach to the Baltic Sea can also be an example for other macro-regions, for example the Danube. May I ask the Commissioner whether, in the light of this, thoughts towards that region …</p>

      <p sl="pl">The regulations concerning research on the welfare of the Baltic Sea which are contained in the Commission’s proposal introduce a certain important element – the strategic planning stage. Without this stage, we would be dealing only with extensive development of this research. For what we need is a broader plan of action, a better strategy which, apart from the sea itself, will include its drainage area, which currently, as we all know, is suffering severe flooding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Special attention should also be given to the selection of experts, for the broad range of research which has been proposed cannot be reduced to phenomena which can be reproduced in a laboratory. Here, research carried out in the field is closely connected with territory which falls under the jurisdiction of a particular country. Therefore, EU law has to be reconciled with national law. The Commission’s selection of independent experts should take this fact into account.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Increasing the research capability of the new Member States in the Baltic Sea region should take account of the fact that, firstly, the research potential in these countries is varied and the generally good potential of research staff is accompanied by poorer laboratory facilities. Therefore, I am surprised by the limit imposed of a 25% share of in-kind infrastructure contribution in the common pool. Secondly, for many countries, the ‘common pot’ is not acceptable, both for legal reasons and in view of the fact that it could adversely affect research plans which are currently being put into effect there. Thirdly, the strategic stage of the programme needs time. Better use should be made of this stage.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly therefore, it is necessary to define the research priorities for the Baltic and its drainage areas, and then the participants in the project should invest in their research facilities to make them ready to work on these priorities. Including Russia in this research on equal terms on the basis of an Eastern Partnership is an important matter.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ek, for her quite excellent work. The BONUS research programme, which is well worth supporting and an excellent initiative, is an outcome of the EU’s Baltic Sea Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I also regard the strategy itself as a very major step forward. Around six years ago, enlargement meant that the Baltic Sea, to all intents and purposes, became an internal sea of the EU. People have become aware of this all too slowly. As Mrs Ek said, there has been much research undertaken with respect to the Baltic Sea, but too little coordinated research to establish a knowledge base, for example, to improve EU policies and make them more intelligent.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I hope that coordinated research will help us at least to become aware of two issues. Firstly, the ecological state of the Baltic Sea is alarming. It is one of the world’s most polluted seas. The world’s largest area of seabed devoid of oxygen – in other words, dead – is in the Baltic Sea. It has been said that the largest desert in Europe lies at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The other issue that research will hopefully help people to understand better is that it is we ourselves who are to blame for the state of the Baltic Sea. The main problem is eutrophication, the consequences of which the rapporteur also described well. The main source of eutrophying nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus – is agriculture. It mainly relates to EU agriculture in the Baltic Sea catchment basin.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I therefore hope that jointly-organised coordinated research will help people to become sufficiently aware of all this and that it will also help us to develop better and more intelligent methods and processes in all sectors, but in agriculture especially, because fertilisers that have entered lakes and seas are nothing more than a waste of resources as far as farmers are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to remember, however, that research cannot solve everything. We also have to understand that saving the Baltic Sea will require genuine changes in policy too, mainly in the area of agriculture, but also in other sectors. I hope we will make saving the Baltic Sea, which is now one of the world’s most polluted seas, a success story from which the rest of the world can learn a lesson.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the Baltic Sea Research and Development (BONUS-169) programme which will integrate the national research activities of the Member States and the European Commission on environment and marine resources management in the Baltic Sea. The BONUS-169 programme is an innovative model and an example for other kinds of regional cooperation in the field of scientific research.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Like the Baltic region, other regions such as southeast Europe would benefit from there being concerted action by the Member States and the Commission, so as to address common challenges and support sustainable development in their regions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would therefore urge Parliament and the Commission to consider the possibility of creating a joint research programme for the southeast region of Europe, focused on areas of great importance, such as the sea, biodiversity and energy sources from the sea, and with a view to the sustainable development of the European Atlantic axis and its neighbouring regions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The EU’s involvement in the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme is proof that Europe’s institutions want to achieve better harmonisation of policies, programmes and the other activities mentioned in the research sector. Joint action is required at EU level in order to deal with the challenges and improve programming efficiency and effectiveness by incorporating all the research activities into a uniform, well-coordinated programme, which will promote the region’s sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The BONUS programme is especially important to the Baltic Sea region. However, its role should not be restricted to just this region. I would like, in future, for this programme to serve as a model for other forms of regional cooperation in Europe, such as in the Danube or Mediterranean Sea regions. This will allow us to have a powerful, dynamic and competitive European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The implementation of the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS-169 has revealed the catastrophic situation of the Baltic Sea, particularly in those areas where large-scale energy infrastructure projects are planned and are being carried out not just by European Union Member States, but by other countries bordering the EU. In some places, genotoxicity has risen several hundred times. The BONUS programme has already shown its potential to contribute to monitoring the Baltic environment and therefore it is necessary to continue to actively research the condition of the Baltic Sea. To ensure that research is as comprehensive and objective as possible, it is very important for scientists from all the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea to be included in research on an equal footing. This programme is a quasi preventative measure, drawing attention to the Baltic Sea’s complex ecological situation. Only by properly funding scientific research and observing threats in time will we stop ecological disasters and I trust that we will ensure that the Baltic Sea …</p>

      <p sl="ro">Environmental problems in certain regions could be dealt with much more successfully if individual countries pooled the research activities they have carried out. This is why I welcome the Commission proposal and the rapporteur’s proposal on supporting the BONUS programme for the Baltic Sea region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that it is a good idea to have included a recital which asks the Commission to carry out a final evaluation of the programme to see the level of quality and effectiveness in implementing programmes of this kind, especially in terms of the progress made in relation to the specified objectives. These results should be published on the programme’s website so that citizens can find out how the programme is going and performing. In fact, representatives of the business sector can also draw up their business plans based on the recommendations and opportunities which emerge from the research results in this region.</p>

I am certain that establishing a consolidated supranational research programme based on reciprocal cross-border cooperation and exchange of experience will contribute to more effective action for the protection of the Baltic Sea and will bring about sustainable development of the region. The BONUS programme was initiated by eight Member States. The Baltic countries include one more country, Russia. It is, therefore, justified that Russian scientists participate in the programme. This research programme should supply a number of proposals for the strategy for the region being developed by the Union and for the role of macro-regions in future cohesion policy, which we debated in Parliament two months ago.

We have to remember, however, that these regions must be connected with one another.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Presently, the main trade in goods is carried on with Indochina, and that is why it is so important to concentrate on ensuring that the Baltic Sea Strategy, too, will include the possibility of connections in the ‘North-South’ TNT network.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Ms Ek, and to the 10 Members of the European Parliament who took the time to be here at a late hour this evening to discuss this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very satisfied that all Article 185 initiatives announced under the cooperation element of the seventh EU framework programme have now been adopted. This is a political achievement for all of the institutions of the European Union. The BONUS initiative would clearly help the countries of the Baltic Sea region to address more effectively the very complex and pressing environmental problems in this area by promoting synergies and avoiding the wasteful duplication of purely national research efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of the key global political problems that we are facing in policy areas such as climate change, energy, food and health, the requirement to pool resources and work together becomes necessary. The Article 185 initiatives are playing a key role in tackling some of these key issues. The experience we gain from these initiatives will allow us to find even better and more efficient ways to collaborate at a European level, making full use of both national and Community research programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said at my European Parliament ratification hearing last January, I am deeply committed to the complete realisation of the European research area, but we must work together in a spirit of unity and cooperation if we are going to achieve this objective. This is vitally important for the future economic development of the European Union and if we are to ensure that the EU becomes a global leader in the fields of research, innovation and science.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, BONUS is, in fact, a pilot project under Article 185, and I can assure everyone who will work on the BONUS programme and everyone who will read or be affected by this that it is not easy. It is not easy to combine research funds from the European Union and from various Member States. It is a huge challenge. It is not easy to coordinate different academic research cultures and traditions, with 16 large research groups, 500 researchers, eight countries and the rest of the EU watching to see how this will actually go, plus everyone who is to review and check that we are doing the right things and that they are proving effective.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This will require a lot from the researchers involved. It will require a lot from the Member States and their governments, and I can assure you that it will require tough political decisions and strong political leadership, but we have to do this. Our research programmes must be thoroughly evaluated and we need to take on this huge responsibility because we need to solve the problems together for the sake of the Baltic Sea. However, we also need to find a model that will enable us to make progress in other parts of Europe. This applies to the large rivers, to the Mediterranean Sea and to how, in general, we handle common resources provided by taxpayers in EU programmes and in national programmes.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Baltic Sea has been part of our common history and culture since the end of the Ice Age, past the time of the Vikings, past the trade during the Middle Ages, past the ‘sea of freedom’ during the Cold War, and now it is a sea that our parents and children love and that we have a responsibility to manage. In view of these difficulties and the huge challenges we face, I would therefore, once again, like to thank everyone involved. The work does not finish with the decisions we take here and the documents we sign; it is now that the work begins.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision on the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the Schengen Information System in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania (06714/2010 - C7-0067/2010 - 2010/0814(NLE)) (A7-0199/2010).</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention four essential points. Firstly, the evaluation procedure. Since joining the European Union in 2007, Romania and Bulgaria have begun to work towards full integration into the Schengen Area. If the Council is to make a decision to abolish internal frontiers, the assessment procedures need to certify that all the conditions necessary for the implementation of the relevant parts of the acquis communautaire are met; namely, data protection, the Schengen Information System, borders by air, land and sea, police cooperation and visa policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The assessment procedures began with the part relating to data protection. This means verifying that each of these Member States is adequately prepared to implement all the provisions in terms of data protection. The results are therefore a prerequisite for the evaluation process for the Schengen Information System, which involves the transfer of data to these countries. Approval of this decision is therefore a first step towards the abolition of checks at internal borders with Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, access to documents. The Council has submitted this draft decision to Parliament. However, evaluation and follow-up reports were not sent; these would enable Parliament access to all the information necessary to develop a reasoned and justified view. The documents were only supplied by the Council after Parliament’s insistence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the efforts of the Ambassador of Romania, with whose help it was possible to find a solution to this situation by applying for confidential documents to be declassified and designated as ‘limited’. This allowed the schedule to be met, but we will have the same problem when Parliament’s opinion is sought on other aspects of the Schengen acquis. It is imperative, then, that the agreement between Parliament and the Council is concluded as quickly as possible regarding the transfer of confidential documents.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, the evaluation of Romania and Bulgaria. In the case of Bulgaria, certain failures were identified relating to the adoption, implementation and enforcement of Recommendation 85/15 by the Council of Europe, concerning the use of personal data in the police sector, and deficiencies were found in the operation of the National Commission for Data Protection. Bulgaria took appropriate action on these recommendations and, on 26 April, the Council concluded that the necessary conditions in terms of data recovery had been met.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the case of Romania, weaknesses were detected in the adoption of two laws regulating the processing of personal data, and also relating to national authority facilities and resources for data protection, as well as the introduction of periodic assessments regarding Schengen data. In general, Romania has taken appropriate action in the light of the recommendations and those that are still pending do not prevent this country from applying, as applicable, all the necessary requirements with regard to data protection. The conditions for giving the green light to Romania and Bulgaria in the field of data protection have thus been verified.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, Mr President, the review of the Schengen evaluation mechanism. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the need to establish a European evaluation mechanism as quickly as possible which is simple, effective, efficient and transparent in the field of Schengen evaluation. Parliament rejected the proposals that were submitted to it last October. I would ask the Commission to exercise its right of initiative as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="2-649" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am quite confident that Bulgaria and Romania will do their utmost to reach the target date for lifting the internal border controls in March 2011. The Commission, within its competences, will fully support both countries in order for them to successfully pass the Schengen evaluation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the responsibility of the Council to carry out the Schengen evaluations and, based on these evaluations, the Council will decide on the lifting of internal border controls. These evaluations are ongoing, so it is too early to assess the state of play of the preparations. But the first steps have been successful, confirmed by the positive evaluation of data protection, which allows now Bulgaria and Romania to get access to the Schengen Information System.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament and Mr Coelho propose that Bulgaria and Romania should inform Council and Parliament on the follow-up recommendations. It is indeed the practice in the current Schengen evaluation that the Member States concerned report to the Council on the measures to comply with the recommendations, as the evaluation mechanism is now under full responsibility of the Council. On that basis, and under current legislation, it is up to the Council to inform Parliament accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, I would like to take up your proposal and confirm that I will soon, in the autumn, propose a new evaluation mechanism following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty for the reasons that you stated, Mr Coelho.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that both Member States and Parliament should be involved in this mechanism. Member States, of course, shall be involved to maintain mutual trust among each other on their capacity to apply all accompanying measures allowing for the lifting of internal border control, in particular, in the field of external borders, visa and police cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament should indeed be fully informed of the outcome of these results of the evaluation. With this new mechanism, the Commission aims to remedy the current weaknesses as referred to by the rapporteur. There is no real follow-up at this time after evaluations are made and the recommendations are not always implemented. The support of Parliament in this process is indeed very much appreciated.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I congratulate Mr Coelho and welcome the progress which this report mentions for Bulgaria and Romania. The positive results and conclusions from the ‘Personal Data Protection’ audit have made it possible to set a date for the Schengen Information System to be implemented in Bulgaria as well.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Both Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union and its accession to the Schengen area generate enthusiasm among all of Bulgaria’s citizens. In fact, it goes beyond enthusiasm as this concerns the opportunity to lift border controls and enforce the right of free movement across the whole European Union. This success is down to the tremendous efforts and resolute actions of the current Bulgarian Government which has done everything possible to make up the ground for the previous years it had lagged behind to meet the conditions and make the necessary preparations to apply the Schengen acquis.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The Schengen area is not only about the freedom of movement. It also means strengthened police and customs cooperation, especially in the context of combating the trafficking of persons and goods, and organised crime on a more general level. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area is part of a journey towards realising our dream of a Europe of citizens. To achieve this, constant efforts are needed, along with compliance with the requirements of the Schengen acquis by the countries’ governments, not to mention steadfast support from Europe’s institutions.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The European Parliament’s access to the recommendations in the evaluation reports and the documents on the subsequent actions to take provide a guarantee that the constructive dialogue between us all will continue.

      <p sl="ro">Yesterday, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of when Europe’s citizens enjoyed, for the first time, the freedom to travel without restrictions within the European Union. On the occasion of this anniversary, Commissioner Malmström stated: ‘Schengen has become one of the most powerful symbols of the EU’s capacity to improve the lives of its citizens’. As for Martin Schulz, the President of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, he said: ‘Schengen is probably the most successful and tangible result achieved by the European Union in the last 30 years’. On this same occasion, I too just want to say: Happy anniversary to Schengen and freedom! Romania and Bulgaria could be an anniversary present for the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">After completing its evaluations, the Council concluded that both Member States provide sufficient guarantees to take the first step towards joining the Schengen area. We will confirm this step by expressing our opinion in favour tomorrow. It will not only be the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria who stand to gain from finally being able to join, but the whole of the European Union as well. Increasing cooperation in the economic, social and administrative sectors will strengthen the EU. Governments in both Member States must fulfil the requirements of the Schengen road map as part of the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am pleased that the European Parliament has successfully fulfilled its role as guarantor of European democracy. The amendment tabled by the rapporteur only serves to initiate a transparent type of cooperation between European institutions. It is the only one which can yield rapid, tangible results in the process of debating and approving European legislation. Interinstitutional disagreements in the European Union must not delay or jeopardise the rights, freedoms and well-being of European citizens whom all of Europe’s institutions exist to serve.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Introducing a new evaluation system will, as Mr Coelho suggested, make it possible to guarantee security and strengthen the principal of mutual trust - essential to maintaining the Schengen area. I support Mr Coelho’s proposals.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, we celebrated the anniversary of the Schengen agreements with President Buzek and President Barroso. This evening, well into the night, we are laying a specific new stone in the foundations for the draft decision of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are passing from thought to deed and to collaboration, to the preliminary and indispensable conditions for the lifting of border checks with Bulgaria and Romania which, according to preliminary evaluations, are in the course of being satisfied. These two countries should, in fact, soon be in a position to guarantee the protection and processing of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is good news and will result in the total integration of these two countries within the Schengen framework, which will contribute towards the strengthening of security and prosperity, not just for these countries but for the continent of Europe as a whole. I am certain that this will allow the problems of illegal migration and immigration, international criminality and all sorts of scourges to be combated. This will help to reduce the risks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, I must point out that some shortcomings are detected. My group fully shares the position of the rapporteur that there should be a follow-up.

      <p sl="pl">Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the European Union in 2007. Now, however, we have the pleasure of discussing the draft Council decision on the application of the Schengen acquis in the two newest Member States of the European Union, which is one of the last steps towards lifting checks at the internal borders with Bulgaria and Romania. Both countries have received a favourable assessment from the committee of experts concerning their readiness for the lifting of checks at the EU internal borders, and the shortcomings which were identified should and certainly will be eliminated quickly. If this happens, it is to be expected that Bulgaria and Romania will be technically ready for connection to SIS II by October 2010, which is in accordance with the current road map. Thanks to this, it will be possible to open Schengen to the two new countries while, at the same time, maintaining the right level of care for the security of citizens and their interests.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Schengen was a trade-off for the freedom of movement of people and goods and trusting those members involved to carry out appropriate measures to ensure safety and security on their own turf. Although the UK is not part of the formal Schengen acquis, we use aspects of the Schengen Information System in fighting crime. Yet, at the same time, the system and the Schengen acquis in general also provide the more astute criminal with a broader platform for international crime and corruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">After the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the SIS, the primary question must be whether these Member States are at a point where they can guarantee a level of scrutiny domestically to warrant free movement across the continent. There has been significant opposition to moving towards a second evolution of the Schengen Information System, in particular, the equilibrium between cost and efficiency. The UK operates independent stringent checks and does not participate in passport-free travel. Will we have to provide financial support for developing information gathering systems in those countries aspiring to Schengen, in order to mitigate the potential increase in crime related to open-border policy?</p>
      <p sl="en">Schengen brought with it an increase in the possibility of trafficking in illegal goods and people across borders. The security of travel without border controls rests heavily upon trust in the ability of individual Member States to perform checks to appropriate standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The expansion of the Schengen Information System increases the window for corruption and creates a much larger collection of information for criminals wishing to hack into the network. Similarly, deeper integration alongside a broadening of Member State involvement may require an expansion of measures used in the Schengen Information System, especially as we approach the advent of SIS II. For example, at what point will the storage of biometric data be positive?</p>
      <p sl="en">Critics also worry that the system may be used to monitor citizens with particular political views, with information garnered liable to be mishandled for political ends. With an increasing number of states joining the acquis, the risk is heightened. About 500 000 computers are currently able to access the Schengen Information System. It cannot be known how many of these systems are free of malicious software. In general, one in two computers have been victims to malicious infection. Spyware allows a third party to access the same data as the user. The broader the system, the more data there is to access, and the greater the number of criminals with aspirations to abuse the system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States must demonstrate exceptionally advanced security and, even with the greatest efforts and intentions, one cannot rule out the possibility of a breach which, in turn, would compromise all involved.</p>

Romania’s adoption of the law aimed at regulating the processing of personal data is an important step towards meeting all the conditions for joining the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is not much to add because there seems to be a very strong consensus here. I fully agree with those of you who have expressed the view that there was indeed a reason to celebrate this week. The Schengen area is an achievement of the European Union; we can be extremely proud of it. It represents the free mobility of people in a Europe without borders and I hope that the Schengen area will soon grow with two more members. In the meantime, access to the Schengen Information System is, of course, a very important first step.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is still some work that needs to be done in these countries on visas, police cooperation, judicial process, organised crime and so on, and we will, of course, closely monitor this.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, four final points. Firstly, to express my thanks for the kind words of my fellow Members and the excellent cooperation on the part of my shadow rapporteurs and, secondly, to stress that there is a large consensus which says yes to these initiatives, but also to demand that Parliament be informed within six months as to the follow-up for the recommendations, which are not yet fully realised.</p>

      <p sl="pt">These two countries are being assessed solely and exclusively by the Council. As Commissioner Malmström has said, we need a European system of evaluation which involves all the European institutions, the European Commission and the Council, but also Parliament. Above all, however, it must be a European system of evaluation which does not operate according to two standards. That is, we cannot subject external states that wish to enter into Schengen to more demanding evaluation criteria than those which we apply to Member States that are already in Schengen. All countries, whether those that wish to enter or those that are already part of Schengen, must give proof of their strict compliance with the Schengen acquis and show that their control of external borders is as good as it should be. This is the only way we can ensure the security of our area of free movement, thus providing our citizens with assurances that they can travel about freely.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The further expansion of the Schengen Area is a positive development and should be supported by all means as it will make the free movement of citizens – a key item of the Union’s acquis – accessible to all citizens. It means a tangible benefit provided by the Union to citizens in their daily lives. The Schengen acquis is particularly important for us, citizens of new Member States, who were barred from Europe for decades. It means a lot to me that another border, this time the Romanian section of Hungary’s external Schengen borders, is expected to disappear in the near future. This will give citizens from both sides of the border, including the 1.5 million ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania, the chance to enjoy a Europe without borders. According to their preparation schedule, Romania and Bulgaria will be able to join the Schengen Area in the first half of 2011, that is, during the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is important to comply with this schedule, to ensure that the interim evaluation milestones are also successful. According to the current (interim) evaluation, there will be no legal obstacles to Romania and Bulgaria starting technical preparations for integration in this area, as well, in the second half of the year. I support the rapporteur’s evaluation and findings, in particular, that the European Parliament and especially the LIBE Committee members must have access to evaluation reports and relevant information before giving their informed opinion.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Area next year could be a key success of the Hungarian EU Presidency, which will begin next January. The decision will increase security in the region and will grant freedom of travel in Europe without border controls to many more millions of citizens, including Hungarians. I welcome the positive evaluation in the last report of the Schengen Evaluation Working Group on the preparedness of the two Member States and that it was approved by the Council comprising Member States’ representatives. As a result, Bulgaria and Romania are expected to be technically ready to join the Schengen Information System in October 2010. After the last evaluation scheduled for December, the two countries will most likely become full members of the Europe without borders next spring. The delay caused by the development of the Schengen Information System cannot have an adverse effect on the accession process of the countries awaiting integration. For Hungary, it is particularly important to ensure that the citizens of its neighbouring countries, including members of the Hungarian communities living outside Hungary, are able to enjoy freedom of travel without borders throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I am glad that the European Council has come to the conclusion that Romania and Bulgaria, the two newest members of the European Union, have met the relevant criteria and that therefore, the Schengen acquis can also be applied in these countries. For the citizens of Europe, one of the most tangible results of European integration is the establishment of the Schengen Area, resulting in unrestricted movement across borders. This opportunity is much more significant for citizens of former Communist countries, since the Iron Curtain blocked their way both physically and figuratively and made it practically impossible for them to travel to Western European countries. Now, twenty years after the fall of Communism, it all seems like a bad dream. By joining the Schengen Area, Romania and Bulgaria will take another step on the road to integration with a unified Europe. As internal border controls disappear, the concept of a ‘border’ will gain a new meaning and the borders between Member States will have a new function. Borders will no longer be administrative boundaries; they will instead become bridges and connect the peoples and countries of Europe. It is a welcome development that Romania and Bulgaria will become full members of the Schengen Area, an area interwoven with so many bridges and open borders.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on sport, specifically concerning players’ agents (2010/2646(RSP)) (O-0032/2010 - B7-0308/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-669" speaker_id="1191" name="Doris PACK" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author" nationality="Germany" birth_date="18-03-1942" birth_place="Schiffweiler/Saar" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Mr Belet’s report on professional football, the European Parliament already stated that it is in favour of better regulation of the activities of sports agents, particularly players’ agents, and on that occasion, we called for an appropriate directive. Now, we once again find ourselves facing that issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">The legal situation is unclear. Since players’ agents often work across borders, national legislation, even where it exists in the first place, is not a suitable method of controlling these activities. In turn, sports federations have limited legal scope of action. As non-state actors, they are not entitled to lay down extensive regulations. In 2000, FIFA, for example, had to relax its licensing procedure for agents for this very reason.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2009, the Commission published a study which pointed, in particular, to worrying connections between players’ agents and criminal activities. There was talk of money laundering, bribery, betting and tax fraud, amongst others practices. Such connections damage the integrity of the sport and are inconsistent with its social role. In addition, the study published by the Commission has found that the financial flows from players’ transfers usually lack transparency, which goes to explain the vulnerability of this system to the criminal machinations I have just mentioned. There is a particular risk, in the case of the agencying of young players, of the agent exploiting the youth and inexperience of players in, say, Africa, promising them a future in European professional football and then dropping them when no club can be found for them, leaving them stranded in Europe as illegal immigrants, without work or support.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this background, we need a European legislative initiative. That would enable us to regulate this issue uniformly across the EU, to plug the legal loopholes and to support sports federations in their efforts towards orderly and transparent agencying of players. In that respect, we should make it our particular aim, as we have requested in our motion, to ban commission payments for agents transferring underage players, so that we can eliminate every financial incentive for these kinds of unfair transactions, especially those involving underage players. I hope that we will get the support of tomorrow’s plenary for our motion today and, above all, that it will encourage the Commission to get to work on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first of all thank Ms Pack for presenting this oral question on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am fully aware of the political importance of this issue. I would recall that the Commission has now published the results of the independent study on sports agents. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the issue at stake. We have learned, for instance, that around 6 000 agents are active across the Member States in all disciplines. However, 95% of them are active in only four sports: athletics, basketball, football and rugby. And within this group, football clearly predominates.</p>
      <p sl="en">The study also tells us that only a limited number of Member States regulate agents through a specific law. Most countries simply rely on general provisions of either labour law or contract law. Some international sports federations have also adopted regulations on agents, notably in the disciplines that I just mentioned: athletics, basketball, football and rugby.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the existing public and private regulations may conflict with each other and create legal uncertainty, the findings of the study show that few obstacles exist to the free provision of agents’ activities across the EU. However, the study highlights a number of dubious practices related to agents’ activities: for instance, the payment of secret commissions, the exploitation of young players, etc. We must address such problems to preserve the integrity and fairness of sports competitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sports movement has been trying to tackle these problems for some time. This is why a number of governing bodies have adopted measures to regulate the activities of agents. The rules put in place by sports bodies may have an advantage: sporting sanctions are sometimes the best way to deter unscrupulous actors in the market, be they agents, clubs or players. But sporting authorities do not have the power to investigate and punish acts which all Member States consider to be crimes: corruption, money laundering, tax evasion and illegal immigration. The sports movement is looking for assistance from the European institutions to tackle the challenges posed by agents.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has an important role to play. We can help to develop the common principles and standards that might serve as a minimum set of rules for countries and sports federations across Europe. We are now assessing which type of action at EU level would be most appropriate. We have several options in mind but, to finally decide what action we should take, we will certainly need further deliberations and consultations.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, I should just like to start with a reference to the Football World Cup in South Africa, which is again showing every day how great sport can be, how great it is for a country, a continent, and particularly the society there. This makes it all the more important for us to preserve sport from the criminal excrescences to which Mrs Pack has already referred, or to make vigorous efforts to tackle these excrescences.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To quote verbatim from the study you have just mentioned, the results of which are now known, ‘Sport is increasingly affected by organised crime’. This is sad but true. We are talking about human trafficking, sometimes of young children, and also about all kinds of financial malpractice. It is clear that the sports federations themselves have neither the ability nor the power to tackle this malpractice efficiently. A European initiative is indeed required, therefore.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We already have various legislative instruments at our disposal – in the treaty and in certain directives – to enable us to take action. I should like to mention a couple of proposals for action. Firstly, we could set to work on strict criteria applicable to all sports agents throughout the Union. The best way to bring about such a situation is via licensing systems for clubs and via a compulsory register for players’ agents. The sports federations can impose this, but the European Union can certainly be a driving force in this connection. For example, the EU can coordinate activities among the various national supervisory authorities.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A second measure we could take would be to introduce absolute transparency into the financial flows in circulation in the world of players’ agents, as these are the root of most evil at present. We have no knowledge of these shady financial flows, which means that they can continue to use top-class sport for money laundering, on the one hand, and bribery on the other.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A third proposal – which Mrs Pack has already discussed – concerns a ban on remuneration for players’ agents who seek to make money from the transfer of underage players. We should definitely take action on this. We have sufficient instruments at our disposal not only to exert pressure on the professional sports federations to push this through but also to take our own initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Back in 2007, by a very large majority, this House called on the Commission to take the initiative in the fight against the excrescences in the world of sports agents. This study makes a number of specific suggestions. Although good, they are clearly inadequate. We are pleased to hear you say here that you do indeed intend to move things up a gear. There have been calls for this even within the sector itself; from the European association of players’ agents. We have had a great deal of contact with them, and they themselves are pushing for the European Union to swing into action to root out the rotten apples. I propose that we respond to their calls in the interests of sport and of its extremely important social role.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are indeed fortunate, I suppose, to be talking about this at the time of the World Cup because what the World Cup illustrates more than almost any other sporting event is just how important sport is to people; just how many millions and millions of people watch football and how much pleasure and passion is invested in it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because of this, it is so important that we actually make sure that the game of football and other sports are regulated properly and that we do now take the action which has been discussed for so long about players’ agents. We are, unfortunately, as has been mentioned, seeing some very serious things going on: abuse, money laundering, corruption, exploitation of underage players; things which are serious crimes against which we really must take the action which we have been planning for so long. What better time to be doing that than now, when the whole world it seems is consumed by football?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I fully support efforts to make the activities of sports agents, mainly in football, more transparent and I believe that the EU should be supporting the various sporting governing bodies to ensure that they can do just that. We need to shine a light into the murky world where exploitation could be rife and matters such as dual representation, whereby the agent can be representing a player at the same club that is trying to sign the player, need to be looked at.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, any legislation that comes forward to regulate this sector must be from the national sporting bodies or authorities such as FIFA and UEFA. It is really not the place of the EU to be regulating in the sporting world, especially with the global nature of this particular problem. Where we can add value to sports we should, but we should only intervene upon the request of the sporting governing bodies where we can clearly deliver value or give clarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I welcome the question raised by our President in the middle of the World Cup. The Commission study has worrying aspects, in that it exposes the risk to the ethics and reputation of sport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the sporting movement is to remain the main player in regulation, by relying on the thousands of charitable men and women who keep alive the sporting spirit as we love it, because is it a factor in individual development, the States should be at their side to punish attacks on public order and to punish excesses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These excesses are found in the sports business, in which players are increasingly becoming commodities and their agents simply brokers, placing them just like commodities. Transfers command astronomical sums and the rights of minors are increasingly trampled upon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These excesses are a cross-border phenomenon, it is money as king, crazy money, and has unfortunately been strengthened by the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. The leading bodies of certain sports in question, especially football, are looking for aid from European bodies. Yes, Commissioner, we need to act and, for my part, I am sorry that France has just passed legislation to the contrary.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, an hour and a half ago, the women were saying that it was late to be discussing women’s issues. Now we are approaching midnight and we are discussing sporting matters.</p>
      <p sl="ga">However, at least we have the opportunity to discuss this; before Lisbon, we did not. Now we have the opportunity and it is good that we are taking it, particularly when we are talking of young people and of the activities of sports agents.</p>
      <p sl="ga">As Mrs Pack said, there are many examples of young people who are promised that they will be big stars in the future. But what happens? They are taken from their homes, from their families, from schools, and then a year or two later, they are discarded. This is what happens to the majority of them.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Now the European Union has a chance to do something about this and to lay down laws and penalties to protect young people from these agents. We should look at what is going on in different sports and in different countries, compile this information and do the best thing – particularly for young people and for sport as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the profession of sports agent is one with no safeguards and little or no supervision, let alone penalties for misconduct, for example, human trafficking. The EU has carried out a study and identified abuses but, as yet, has failed to do anything about the situation. Yet something must be done. I am very concerned about the vulnerability of underage players, particularly those from developing countries, who are often victims of human trafficking. The EU has to clamp down on this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The resolution presents specific proposals: putting a stop to remuneration for agents of underage players, enforcing more transparency in financial transactions during transfers, and more regulation by Member States given that the sports federations do not have the situation under control at present. Specific measures are required in order to tackle Wild West conditions. The Commission must ensure that enforcement and the penalising of malpractice – which, after all, is often cross-border in nature – are improved. In addition, the rights of underage players must be safeguarded effectively at all times.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the initiative suggested by Ivo Belet of setting up a standard system for protecting the interests of sports men and women who use the services of agents, which will reduce incidences of misconduct in this area relating to the lack of transparency with transfers, money laundering and human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As I see it, we need to focus appropriate attention not only on football, but on all the other sports as well. For example, we currently have around 6 000 agents who are active in Europe, representing 30 different sports, involved in business activities with an estimated annual value of hundreds of millions of euro. In these circumstances, imposing a single code of rules for licensing players’ agents will be far from an easy task.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, we will have to support a clearer definition of the functions of an agent, whether as a manager of players or as an intermediary in transfers. Looking ahead …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there is one good thing about having this debate at this late hour – our discussion is not being held during the transmission of World Cup matches, so we have time for the debate. On a serious note, however, we have the Treaty of Lisbon, which obliges us to take very serious action in a situation which is wrong and which it has not been possible to solve for years. We have before us the European Championships organised in two years’ time by Poland and Ukraine, so I am extremely pleased with the decision made by Mr Belet, Mrs Pack and Mrs Vassiliou, who has been so actively involved in this, that harmonisation of legislation is needed in this area. The system is, indeed, not transparent and is burdened with decades of corruption. The trade in young players is taking on enormous proportions, and is leading to many situations where money is being shared, even after transfers have been completed and high fees paid. Transfer fees are so high that they sometimes put clubs into debt. This is why we need a new code …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I believe that we all agree on the importance of sport and that it can be very enjoyable for all of us. I thank you all very much for your input and proposals which will be seriously taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that some EU action is desirable; sports federations do not have the powers to intervene in some of the worse cases of malpractice. Such problems now take on a transnational dimension as sport becomes more globalised.</p>
      <p sl="en">The internationalisation of professional sport makes it difficult to adopt a national approach to problems of a systemic nature. The EU can play a coordinating role and help to ensure a harmonised approach to the issue of agents. We might, for example, use the new competence acquired by the EU for the harmonisation of criminal law. Many actors within the sports movement would certainly welcome our support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, whatever action we decide to take, we will work closely with the relevant federations and I intend to publish – as you know – a communication on sport very soon and this communication will certainly look at this issue in more detail. It would be wrong to prejudice the discussions which we need to have with you, the Parliament, as well as the sports movement itself. I am looking forward to working closely with you to take this issue forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">In this era of commercialisation and professionalism, agents are unavoidable aspects of the sporting landscape. The Commission Report estimates that 6 000 agents are active in the EU, generating a turnover of over EUR 200 million for the transfer of players and athletes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Football is the only sport where agents are active in all EU Member States. Football in Europe is big business and it is essential that fair play and integrity are at the heart of the sport. The illicit trafficking and transfer of young players across borders is a worrying issue. This situation is particularly associated with football clubs and their search for talent. It is estimated that around 20 000 young Africans have been brought to Europe to play football but now live in the EU illegally because they did not secure a career as a football player. Closer cross-border regulation, monitoring and minimum harmonised standards for agents’ contracts would contribute to tackling this problem and are necessary to ensure the integrity of football.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the cross-border dimension of this issue, I would urge the Commission to carve out an effective and strong role for itself in order to protect minors and halt the trafficking of players.</p>
