      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Protocol which will be put to the vote is a particularly important document. The aviation markets of the European Union and the United States, taken together, account for around 60% of world air traffic. Opening the market to airlines from the European Union and the United States on a non-discriminatory basis will offer passengers and freight operators improved services, provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs. My dream is for passengers to benefit from competition between airlines on the basis of market principles, for passengers flying in transit to the United States to pass through one security point, for passengers in the European Union and the United States to enjoy the same rights, and, of course, for them to be aware of these rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Will this Protocol guarantee these things? No. Yet I am convinced that it is a step in the right direction, and that it will make it significantly easier in the future to achieve these goals. During the successive rounds of negotiations between the EU and the United States, it was touch and go several times whether the Protocol would be signed. Finally, however, we succeeded in adopting it. As a result, a number of risks were avoided, including the greatest risk of all, namely that the suspension clause would be triggered, which would have resulted in the suspension of the agreement and the annulment of the results of both stages of negotiations. This would have meant a return to the legal situation as it stood seven years ago, which would be unacceptable. Six of the EU Member States have no bilateral air transport agreements with the United States, and rejection of the document would have meant preventing these Member States from being able to operate flight connections between their airports and US territory.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second stage of the agreement does not achieve the ultimate objective of a complete opening of the market without any restrictions on either side, but it does contain a number of incentives to encourage reform. In particular, when the US changes its legislation to allow EU investors majority ownership of US airlines, the EU will allow the same for US investors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am particularly pleased by the fact that the significance of the agreement’s social dimension is emphasised. In this context, the Commission should utilise the agreement to promote compliance with the appropriate international regulations on social rights, in particular with the employment standards set out in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation and the OECD, and with the Rome Convention. This will ensure better observance of existing employee rights by airlines. The agreement will also strengthen cooperation on environmental matters by requiring compatibility and interaction in the field of green technologies and fuel and air traffic management.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my capacity as rapporteur, I endeavoured to place the issue in a broader context and present both the positive and the negative features of the Protocol, without succumbing to the temptation to concentrate exclusively on its weak or strong points. I did not start work with the a priori assumption that we must support or reject this Protocol. Following a great many meetings and discussions, I came to the conclusion that the EU will benefit much more from adopting this document than from rejecting it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament’s consent was required for the conclusion of international agreements. Air transport agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field which the ordinary legislative procedure applies to.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Prior to the current agreement, aviation was the subject of bilateral agreements with 19 of the EU Member States. I am referring by this to the agreements between the European Union and Canada. Many of these agreements contained numerous restrictions and did not offer full access to the respective markets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In November 2002, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that certain provisions in these bilateral agreements were incompatible with Community law.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The negotiating mandate sets the objective of establishing an open aviation area between the European Union and Canada. This would create a single market for air transport between the European Union and Canada where investment could flow freely and where European and Canadian airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement was initialled on 30 November 2008, endorsed by the EU-Canada summit on 6 May 2009 and signed on 17-18 December 2009.</p>
      <p sl="ro">What is the content of the agreement? The agreement includes a gradual phasing-in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far-reaching cooperation on a number of issues including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, the environment, air traffic management, state aid and competition.</p>
      <p sl="ro">All European Union airlines will be able to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in Europe. The agreement removes all restrictions on routes, prices or the number of weekly flights between Canada and the European Union. Airlines are free to enter into commercial arrangements such as code-share agreements, which are important for airlines serving a large number of destinations, and to set their fares in line with competition law.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The agreement contains provisions for opening the market in phases. Phase one applies where the foreign ownership of airlines is limited to 25%, as was the case when the negotiations on the agreement were completed. Phase two starts as soon as Canada has taken the necessary steps to enable European investors to own up to 49% of Canadian carriers’ voting equity. Phase three begins once both sides introduce the possibility for investors to set up and control new airlines in each others’ markets. Phase four is the final step with full rights to operate between, within and beyond both markets, including between places in the territory of the other party. I am referring here to cabotage.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to mention a few points about this report. Although this agreement is more ambitious than that with the US regarding market access, it is less explicit when it comes to recognising the importance of the social dimension.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is important that the Commission uses the agreement and, in particular, the possibility of reference to the Joint Committee, to promote compliance with relevant international legislation on social rights, especially the labour standards embodied in the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Given the important role played by the Joint Committee, including in politically sensitive matters such as environmental and labour standards, it is important that the Commission ensures that Parliament is kept fully informed and consulted about the Committee’s work and also about future amendments to the Treaty.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011-000" speaker_id="96885" name="Dominique Riquet" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I shall be very brief, not because the Agreement with Vietnam is any less important, but because Mrs Ticău has reiterated, in the previous report on Canada, the legislative and regulatory framework within which these air agreements between the European Union and a third country will apply.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The context is therefore exactly the same as this one except that our agreement, which is simpler and less ambitious, seeks to regularise horizontally, in the area of air services, the 17 bilateral agreements that previously existed between Vietnam and the countries of Europe, and naturally to extend them to all EU countries. This agreement does not relate to the opening-up of the market because Vietnam’s economy is a regulated State economy and there is obviously no question of opening up the market. The aim is therefore – as the previous rapporteur has already said – to bring into line with European legislation the existing bilateral agreements on air services that have been concluded up to now between the European Union and Vietnam.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the main characteristics of this Agreement is a designation clause relating to all EU air carriers. This will give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and Vietnam. This Agreement also includes safety provisions designed to standardise and equalise these kinds of provision, in addition to a clause against anticompetitive practices. We have come up against several difficulties, which explains why it has taken some time to reach this Agreement – several years in fact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the inclusion of a fuel taxation clause, this was eventually rejected by Vietnam. This clause, which generally features in air agreements negotiated by the Commission, allows for the taxation of a third-country carrier when it operates a flight within the EU. It should be stated, of course, that Vietnam does not operate nor will operate for the time being any flights within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the Vietnamese Government has promised to enter into bilateral negotiations with Member States if this proves necessary or if, indeed, a Vietnamese national airline were to schedule a flight within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, the ratification of the Agreement evidently offers more advantages than does the absence of such an Agreement even though it lacks a fuel taxation clause. It will, however, ensure that the principles of EU law are respected bilaterally and in the case of all EU Member States. We therefore obviously call on the European Parliament to ratify this Agreement.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs in particular for supporting the Commission on these important agreements. All three have been strongly supported by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the US agreement, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Zasada, for his very positive recommendation in relation to the outcome of the negotiations with the United States on a second stage air services agreement. You will remember that the aim of the second stage discussions was to facilitate the normalisation of the transatlantic market and extend the scope and depth of the excellent aviation relationship established through the implementation of the first stage agreement, in place since March 2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">I now want to mention the key elements of the second stage aviation agreement. The second stage agreement creates the prospects for additional investment and market access opportunities. It also further strengthens the framework of cooperation on the environment, social protection, competition and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the environment, the agreement establishes a clear framework for tackling local and global challenges. The agreement seeks to reduce the security burden on passengers, airlines and airports across Europe. For the first time in such an aviation agreement, the need to balance market access opportunities with strong social protection has been recognised through a commitment to implementing the provisions of the agreement in a way which does not undermine labour rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the commercial front, Europe has gained further rights, including immediate access to the ‘Fly America’ programme with the exception of defence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second stage agreement is not perfect. Like you, I would have liked to have seen an immediate and irrevocable change to the US laws governing ownership and control of its airlines. This has not been possible, but we were able to secure a commitment from the United States to work towards reforming these rules in the future. As part of the agreement, the EU and the United States have committed to the goal of removing the remaining market barriers in industry, including those that limit airlines’ access to global capital.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the agreement with Canada. My thanks go to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and in particular to Ms Ţicău. This ambitious agreement is designed to achieve complete opening of the markets for traffic rights and investment, at the same time reaching an unprecedented level of regulatory convergence and cooperation between the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to market access, the agreement comprises the full range of traffic rights and investment opportunities: this means 100% ownership and control. It is done through a phased market opening in four phases. Among its multiple benefits for both sides, it is also worth noting the establishment of a level playing field for the industry, as well as common or compatible standards for safety, security and air traffic management. Last but not least, I am convinced that by removing existing regulatory restrictions this agreement will lead to a substantial increase in passengers and generate various consumer benefits and the creation of new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Vietnam, let me also start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Riquet, for his support for this horizontal agreement. Currently, we have negotiated 45 such horizontal agreements with partner countries worldwide. On 4 October 2010, during a visit to the European Union, the Vietnamese Prime Minister signed the agreement, which represents an important step towards strengthening aviation relations between the EU and Vietnam.</p>
      <p sl="en">The horizontal agreement will restore legal certainty to our aviation relations with Vietnam by bringing the bilateral air services agreements between 17 Member States and Vietnam into line with EU law. Most importantly, it will remove nationality restrictions in bilateral air services agreements between EU Member States and Vietnam. It will thereby allow any EU airline to benefit from the existing bilateral agreements between Vietnam and the Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much for your attention. I am looking forward to the debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their reports. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcome these agreements.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this case, 27 agreements which could have been concluded in these areas are being replaced by just one. For us, technical harmonisation is also an important point. It increases levels of safety not just for the airlines themselves, but also for the passengers. The opening up of the market and the cooperation at a European level should be treated in the same way by both sides. It is important to highlight the fact that the agreement with Canada is a very good example of this, while the agreement with the USA leaves something to be desired.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another area which leaves something to be desired is the lack of regular checks on the social and environmental aspects of these agreements, which should be a part of all future agreements, because the simplification of the economic aspects should also enable us to use these agreements to influence not only the European market but also the global market. Importantly, these agreements also bring benefits for passengers, because they can result in the controls being simplified without them being neglected.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say that we welcome this agreement, because, as I have already said, 27 agreements are ultimately being replaced by one. This is a clear indication that we will hopefully soon be dealing with only seven or perhaps even three airspaces, instead of with the current 27, as part of measures to improve air safety and implement the single European sky. This will make negotiations on these agreements much simpler.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014-000" speaker_id="25718" name="Saïd El Khadraoui" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs for the work they have done and for the helpful cooperation on their part. When we launch, shortly, a more general debate in response to Mr Brian Simpson’s report on aviation agreements, we will get an opportunity to address more thoroughly the general approach and strategy with regard to this sort of agreement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, emphatically support the replacement of old bilateral agreements between our Member States and third countries with comprehensive global agreements at European level. This is the best guarantee of a level playing field for all our airlines. It will also strengthen the integration of our own aviation sector as it will, of course, our negotiating position in relation to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is important, in that regard, that we pay attention not only to the opening up of the market for additional flying rights and suchlike, but also to a strengthening of the regulatory framework in the environmental and social fields and the fields of safety and security. We absolutely have to bring these into line with each other, at a very high level. Another important point to mention here is that, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force, Parliament is not just supposed to give an opinion, but really has to approve these agreements as well. My message, therefore, to the Commission and the Council is that they should make full use of those powers and that Parliament, therefore, should retain its say in approving or modifying additions or other amendments at a later stage.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to the agreements before us, our group believes that the agreement with Canada comes the closest to the model that we have in mind, that is extensive cooperation in the fields of security, social issues and consumer and environmental protection. Indeed, the rapporteur has rightly observed that the sections on social issues should have been worded a little more strongly, but that can be resolved in the Joint Committee which will now have to make a few things concrete. Besides that cooperation, there is also the gradual introduction of additional flying rights and the gradual extension of the opportunity to become a shareholder in each other’s airlines.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The agreement with Vietnam also reminds us of the growing importance of the Asian market, and I think that, on this particular point, we have to point out that the Council has been dragging its heels for years over giving the Commission a mandate to negotiate with countries such as China and India. That mandate is essential, of course, if we are to make progress on this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By way of conclusion, I would like to say a few things about the agreement with the United States, particularly regarding the second stage. This concerns an area which covers 60% of the world aviation market and is therefore extremely important. I personally was a rapporteur for this House when, a few years ago, the first stage was approved. With regard to the United States, we are not completely satisfied because some things still have to happen in terms of market access. We ask the Commission to give an undertaking that this will not be the end, that it will proceed on the course of opening up the market and that we, as Parliament, will be fully involved in the activities of the Joint Committee.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015-000" speaker_id="96870" name="Gesine Meissner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur. We have already discussed the fact that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now has the opportunity to vote in favour of air service agreements of this kind or to reject them. We cannot change the contents, but we can accept or oppose them. This does not always make things simple, but it is at least a new task, which we are taking very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="de">It makes sense to replace a number of different bilateral agreements with one standardised EU agreement. It is clear that there are no boundaries in airspace, which is a good way of explaining this. The European Union is also a strong economic community and so it is sensible to discuss agreements made by the EU with different third countries, which is what we are doing now.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a number of very different agreements on the table today. I will start with Vietnam. This is the least complex agreement. It concerns different accesses and services and also safety regulations, but it is a relatively short agreement, which is why I am only mentioning it briefly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most comprehensive agreement is the one with Canada. In this agreement it was not just a case of ensuring free access to air services which can be used in different ways, but also of covering issues such as the environment, safety and also market access and ownership. In that respect we have long since passed the first stage of 25% and already reached the second stage of 49% ownership of each other’s air services market. Now we are about to enter stages 3 and 4. In stage 3 it is possible to establish airlines in another country and another region. Stage 4 would allow a European airline to fly from A to B within Canada.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have not come nearly as far as this with the USA, despite the fact that we have been negotiating with the USA for a long time. I would like to make one more point. Mr Kallas said that we were all very much in support of this issue, but in the case of the USA our reaction is more restrained, because the agreement does not represent a true partnership. The USA wants to take more from us than it is prepared to give. We need to continue negotiating on this. Apart from this issue, we will vote in favour, because it is clear that progress has been made.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we also welcome the successful conclusion of the second phase of the EU open skies agreement. Indeed, after several years it was rather overdue. Obviously this agreement is a significant breakthrough and it is to be welcomed. I acknowledge that negotiators have made huge progress in the areas of security, competition, market access and environmental cooperation. But, like the Commissioner, I am disappointed that this agreement did not achieve its ultimate objective of a complete opening of the market without restrictions on either side. The failure to resolve fully issues of foreign ownership and control (cabotage) must be addressed in future discussions if European carriers are to truly benefit. Of course agreements mean compromise, but that does not mean getting a deal at any price.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aviation industry is massively important to Europe. It facilitates economic growth, trade, investment and tourism. Air agreements with third countries offer our airlines great opportunities in foreign markets, and I therefore urge the Commission to continue to strive to conclude air agreements which are fair, robust and lead to full liberalisation, which will benefit both European carriers and consumers. Finally, can we just add our support to the EU-Vietnam agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years we have concluded a large number of air service agreements, which have always involved summarising the old national agreements under a European umbrella. Now things are starting to change with regard to the involvement of the European Union and I think this is very important.</p>
      <p sl="de">The agreement with Vietnam largely follows the old model that we have always used. However, the agreement with Canada is more ambitious, which I welcome. The cooperation in the field of the environment and social issues is positive, but in my opinion it could be extended even further. The situation concerning the agreement with the USA is quite different. In this case, I believe that we have given in far too early. Market access is a question of fairness and in this agreement the regulations are not fair. Nevertheless, we have climbed down. To a large extent there has been a failure to cover certain aspects of social conditions. Much too little has been done in this area. We must ensure that social dumping does not take place here, because this is also a safety issue when it comes to airlines. We finally need to make this clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that there are major problems with regard to environmental issues. The USA is starting to exert significant pressure to have night flight restrictions, which are in place to protect local residents, relaxed or lifted. The pressure in this area is enormous and I am afraid that we will have to give in. We must make it quite clear that this would be a disaster for everyone who lives near an airport. On the safety question, the USA is gradually tightening the screw and unfortunately the implementation in the European Union is going unchallenged. This is a mistake and I want to be very clear on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to mention code-sharing, which is being presented as a major achievement. I would like to say just one thing. This will ultimately restrict passengers’ choices. I will not be able to choose which airline I fly with and I may find myself confronted with a completely different airline when I reach the gate. The concept of competition in the airline industry is fictitious and it is becoming even more so when it comes to the position of passengers.</p>

I believe that the implementation of these agreements would provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs. In addition, regulatory convergence could promote fair competition. While the second-stage Agreement represents a significant step forward, it is important for it not to be regarded as the end of the process of establishing a transatlantic aviation market.</p>

      <p sl="de">We know that the negotiations on these and on other agreements are of the highest quality, but it is important for us to be aware of the strengths and weak points of the agreements after they come into force, so that we can make a better contribution.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, tomorrow it will be one year to the day since the second stage of the air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States was finally signed after eight rounds of difficult negotiation. As such, I believe we should feel satisfied – me in particular, of course – that this was accomplished under the Spanish Presidency and under the leadership of the Minister of Public Works and Transport, José Blanco, who achieved considerable progress in aviation matters, including the single sky and labour relations in the air traffic control sector, where a negotiated settlement was reached.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also welcome the fact that Parliament is using its new powers for the approval of such international agreements, specifically in relation to the transport industry.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second stage of the EU-US air transport agreement eliminates the suspension clause, which entails the need to continue making progress and improving a number of issues in relation to the environment, competition and passengers’ rights, with which we are not completely satisfied as yet.</p>
      <p sl="es">For the first time, the agreement also addresses labour relations. I believe this is a matter of paramount importance, as it also enables the safeguarding of workers’ rights for the first time, as well as the future applicability of International Labour Organisation and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development conventions.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agreement also sets out clear guidelines – and I believe this is quite significant – to build mutual trust in the area of security. The possibility of a one-stop system must remain open.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore believe this is a good agreement, which establishes a new non-discriminatory basis, entails improved service to the public and to companies, is economically and socially beneficial, and encourages fair competition. Nevertheless, it is once again not perfect, as the extent of European ambitions means we must seek to go beyond this second stage.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore need to examine and exploit all the potential that is available to us, including the Joint Committee and its new powers, as well as the new possibilities opened up at the International Civil Aviation Organisation regarding the Single European Sky ATM Research and others. We therefore call on Vice-President Kallas to push for this agreement, to follow it closely and, of course, to report to Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Open Skies Agreement between Europe and the United States is an advance, but it is just one stage and it faces Europe with a dilemma. The Committee on Transport and the Commission have themselves pointed this out. Either we accept an agreement that disadvantages European businesses, or we suspend the agreement and risk losing the benefits we have gained since 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So allow me to draw a parallel with the licences of professional and private pilots – a text which will be debated before the summer – because pilots, of whom I am one, face a dilemma. The European Aviation Safety Agency, which wants to harmonise licences throughout Europe, will do so to the detriment of the 80 to 90 000 general aviation pilots directly affected – some of whom hold only a US licence – and to the detriment – and this is the important point – of those companies and jobs connected to this activity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to draw your attention to this project which has nothing to do with safety. There are 31 times fewer accidents amongst holders of US licences. The objectives of Basic Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 provide for the recognition of and equivalent rating of licences for which it is judged unnecessary to wait for hypothetical agreements that have been pushed back to 2014.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, I propose a very open sky agreement and even invite you to accompany me on those occasions when I come to Parliament flying my own plane, to show you that a US pilot licence is perfectly safe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I want to congratulate Mrs Ţicău on this ambitious agreement with Canada. The agreement marks an important phase in the process of opening the market. At the same time, it will help create new air routes and develop new opportunities for investors on both sides of the Atlantic, in terms of both the development of new investments and the introduction of new services for European and Canadian citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the decision to allow airlines to operate without restriction anywhere in Europe and Canada is valuable and will be of benefit to consumers, airlines and the economies of both countries in general. The implementation of this agreement will lead to more services being operated by airlines and to new cargo transport opportunities. However, this development must also raise greater concern about consideration of the impact on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The agreement will also make the European and Canadian markets safer by strengthening cooperation with regard to compliance with certification procedures and inspections aimed at guaranteeing a maximum level of safety for passengers and goods.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Canada, it is with particular pleasure that I speak on this EU-Canada agreement. I think it is very worthwhile reiterating some of the significant features of the agreement. As mentioned before, in Phase 1, airlines have unlimited freedom to operate direct services between any point in the EU and Canada, without limitation on the number of providers or, indeed, services. We move to Phase 3; we will see investors able to set up new airlines in each other’s countries and, in Phase 4, full cabotage rights and the potential for 100% ownership of carriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement also sets out mutual standards for safety and security. And that is important because it means that the transfer of passengers, luggage and cargo should benefit from a more streamlined approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is an important agreement for the EU and our aviation sector. It will allow increased competition, greater choice for the travelling public. Not only that, I believe that the comprehensive nature of this agreement can serve as a benchmark for future agreements with other countries. This resolution clearly demonstrates Canada’s position as our most proactive international partner, and I wholeheartedly support it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, these agreements are part of the liberalisation process that is currently underway in the air transport sector. They are clearly marked by ideology. Even in this strategic sector, the aim is to cripple state intervention and regulation, opening the doors to the monopolistic concentration that always results from free competition, which is considered sacrosanct.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Under the pretext of facilitating business opportunities within international air transport, this promotes the interests of multinationals within the sector at the expense of national companies and their respective strategic interests, including those that, as is the case in Portugal with TAP, are publicly owned.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This means that both the workers and the passengers lose out. Workers lose out because liberalisation facilitates dumping by multinationals, leading to work-related insecurity due to the forced deterioration of working conditions. Passengers also lose out because, among other things, aeronautical safety will tend to be left to the whim of cost/benefit considerations by companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is nothing new. The situation in other sectors such as rail transport, which has seen increased liberalisation, amply demonstrates the consequences of putting the tenets of the free market into practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members very much for their comments. Of course the most complicated issue is the agreement and negotiation process with the United States. I can assure you that this is far from being the end. It is one part of the process and we are definitely continuing to negotiate with the United States but I would like to underline that the United States is a very difficult partner. As many of you mentioned, 60% of world aviation is covered by the EU and the United States. What we decide in cooperation will also define the whole framework and whole environment for aviation in the world, so the cooperation is also extremely important for the whole world. It also must be made very clear that the Americans have the same parliamentary procedures: they have the US Congress, which is very difficult to deal with precisely because of protectionist feeling, but we are working together and developing our relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will be going to Washington in a few weeks’ time, and we have committed ourselves to work in five directions: first safety, second security, third technological cooperation – we signed an important agreement in Budapest about interoperability of air traffic management systems which is extremely important for Europe so that we do not lose our competitive advantages –, fourth the environment and fifth commerce or business.</p>
      <p sl="en">On business, as you know and as you mentioned, there are ridiculous restrictions on ownership rights. But it must also be very clear that we cannot force the United States to surrender; we must negotiate and this is sometimes not so obvious. We must negotiate and we have to take into account their concerns. It looks quite promising, but we definitely cannot win any commerce or especially technological confrontation: this should be avoided, it can be very dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, as I say, in October we committed to moving in these five directions and definitely the next agreements will follow and we will try with the new US Congress to facilitate market openings which will be the most difficult part as several of you have already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to say that, yes, the Vietnam agreement is of course by magnitude much smaller than the other agreements but it is very important that we form an aviation area which behaves with the same rules and which follows the same rules and this is exactly the aim of these agreements, especially – which is a difficult element in negotiations with third countries – the recognition of EU carriers. You know that this has been a very sensitive issue, and with these agreements with third countries we create better possibilities for European airlines as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your comments. I promise that we will keep you informed about all future developments. We have had several discussions in the TRAN Committee about the concepts of these negotiations and further development and, here again, one has to negotiate with difficult partners. This is the eternal truth of all negotiations but the picture has not been so bad. We have achieved a lot including with the United States, with the recognition of EU carriers and several other things. There I can assure you that I will again meet the leaders of the US transport policy; there is a certain willingness to cooperate and to find ways to solve our conflicting problems.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I am very grateful for all the opinions voiced on the air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States. I accept that the agreement is not perfect; it is another step in the right direction, but we have certainly not reached the end of the road. We were not able to amend this document for procedural reasons. Rejection of the agreement would however have meant sacrificing the gains made during both stages of negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my report, I have included a call for certain changes which should be the focus of the Joint Committee’s work, or which should form the basis of a third stage of negotiations. In particular, I call for the further liberalisation of traffic rights, additional foreign investment opportunities, the adoption of a much more ambitious position on environmental protection and better coordination of political strategies on passenger rights in order to ensure passengers the highest possible level of protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, my work on this document is not yet complete. I intend to monitor the actions of the Joint Committee, which was appointed in order to ensure that the agreement’s provisions would be implemented appropriately or even extended. I will strive to ensure that a permanent observer sits on the Joint Committee on behalf of the European Parliament. If the committee does not live up to the hopes invested in it, Parliament should call on the Commission to open a third stage of negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would of course like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for their comments and assistance when drafting this report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the air transport agreement between the European Union and Canada can be described as the most ambitious air transport agreement between the European Union and a major world partner.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It will significantly improve the connections between the markets of both countries and the links between people, while also creating new opportunities for the airline sector through a gradual liberalisation of foreign ownership rules. In particular, the agreement is more ambitious and specific than the agreement between the European Union and United States on traffic rights, ownership and control, even following the provisional application of the amending protocol, which is therefore phase two.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to a study undertaken by the Commission, an open agreement with Canada would generate an additional half million passengers in its first year and, within a few years, 3.5 million new passengers might be expected to take advantage of the opportunities such an agreement could offer.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The agreement could generate consumer benefits of at least EUR 72 million through lower fares and would also create new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we welcome the ambitious nature of this agreement. It should provide an objective and model for other negotiations currently in progress.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In recent years the European Union has negotiated and concluded several agreements with other states in the field of air transport.</p>
      <p sl="pt">According to the Court of Justice, the traditional designation clauses in the existing bilateral agreements infringe EU law, as they constitute discrimination against EU carriers established in a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States. As such agreements violate the principle of freedom of establishment, as set out in Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU has initiated and is developing a practice for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements between the EU, of the one part, and third countries, of the other part, with regard to air transport. We can identify the main elements of these agreements as the concerns relating to security, passenger rights, the mutual recognition of certification and cooperation on regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, I would like to call attention to Parliament’s limited role with regard to these dossiers. Following the Treaty of Lisbon’s entry into force, its opinion is binding, but only in terms of the final text which has already been signed; it cannot make suggestions or changes to its content.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The delegation of the Dutch Labour Party to the European Parliament certainly does not consider this second stage agreement to be perfect, but it takes the view that it will lead to progress in important areas. In addition, it will prevent the United States from activating the suspension clause in the absence of such an agreement. Suspension could lead to European passengers and airlines no longer being able to profit from the significant benefits which they have enjoyed since March 2008 thanks to this protocol. The benefits and positive aspects include, in particular, agreements on working standards for airline staff, sharing good practice with regard to noise abatement, strengthening cooperation in the field of environmental protection and so on. The delegation of the Dutch Labour Party to the European Parliament recognises the ongoing need to pursue a proper debate on safety requirements (such as the use of scanners) and the impact on privacy and health of passengers of such requirements. In addition, it would highlight the need for the privacy of European and US citizens to be put centre stage and respected when passengers’ personal data is exchanged between the EU and the US. It is essential that Parliament is and remains involved in these negotiations and that European regulations are not eroded.</p>

    <intervention id="4-035-000" speaker_id="96639" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Balzani, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget [2011/2042 BUD] (A7-0058/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-036-000" speaker_id="96979" name="Francesca Balzani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document we are examining today is not merely a report on the priorities of the next European budget, but also and above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the first year of the European Semester, which has been designed precisely to establish the greatest possible coordination between the Union’s budget and those of the Member States, the greatest possible synergy and the utmost complementarity. All of which essentially means one thing: convergence, and making the budgets of the Member States converge with the major goals of the European budget. Today, these objectives – these European objectives – can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy: a grand, ambitious strategy with five highly important targets and seven big flagship initiatives. These are big, important goals, but they are also very specific.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first target is extremely important and involves building a more fully, better employed Europe by making the right investments. We therefore have a huge priority for the 2012 budget: we must not waste time in executing the 2020 Strategy, beginning with the first of the targets, that of higher employment in Europe. Immediately setting out the dimension of the 2020 Strategy in our budget is therefore essential and a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="it">Two things are fundamental in order to achieve this: we must plan and we must look to the future. Planning means ruling out mathematical approaches to the budget, which are absolutely senseless. Mathematical, general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all. Instead we must look at what exactly are the programmes and the actions that can contribute to the 2020 Strategy. Looking to the future has an absolutely crucial significance: taking the utmost care over our commitments and not simply over our payments, because commitments are the tool with which to build the sustainable financial future of our Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Flexibility is another important subject. We are at the end of the planning period and so the budget is particularly rigid. I therefore think that it is really important that, right from the start, we consider all the available flexibility instruments as fundamental and indispensable for the budget we are going to draw up if we want it to be not only possible or essential to take the first step towards the 2020 Strategy – which absolutely must not be a failure, as we have seen in the past – but also if we want it to be a useful and effective budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced that it will only be possible to reach all these major objectives if we work together patiently, right from the very start, to build a renewed climate of institutional cooperation. Institutional cooperation is one of the major challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we always talk about rather carelessly. Institutional collaboration means really finding a renewed feeling of equality so as to work together on this sensitive issue, the budget, which is not only one of the most strategically important instruments to build our future, but also one of the most tangible and practical.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-037-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome Parliament’s position on the priorities of the 2012 budget as reflected in the proposed guidelines. The Commission, in line with its right of initiative, will of course take into account Parliament’s guidelines and also assess the guidelines of the Council. On the other hand, we have to take into account the most recent data coming from the 27 Member States, and we will have our services carefully scrutinise and evaluate those elements in order to shape the draft budget on 20 April.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is now the second test of the annual procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon. The context of financial consolidation is obvious to everybody. I think, in such a context, that it would be responsible to take into account and respond to all the fiscal financial obligations of the European Union, but also to bear in mind the context of austerity which is the reality in the Member States. At this time, more than ever, no-one could argue against the need to base the budget on the principles of rigorous and sound budgeting. It has never been so important to look for savings, but we should also use the tool of the European budget in order to help Europe in this post-crisis situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">With that in mind, I would point out two differences between national budgeting and Europe’s budget. National budgeting is mainly about social transfers, about consumption. The European budget is about investment with multiplier effects. Therefore it could be conducive to growth and jobs. It is not good or sound budgeting to fail to pay out on the outstanding commitments agreed on in previous years, so both must be taken into account when shaping the final draft proposal for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">As mentioned in the letter from the President of the Commission, and as the rapporteur, Ms Balzani clearly stated, we must ensure sufficient funding for expenditure under the 2020 Strategy. Yes, we have to coordinate the efforts of national and European budgeting, but on the other hand, we must be especially rigorous when it comes to administrative expenditure – hence the Commission’s commitment of less than 1% for administration. That means savings as regards contractual obligations and savings in areas such as conferences, mission costs, meetings and information technology.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taking into account what happened last year, we hope that this time it will be a smoother procedure, building on the experience of 2011. Therefore I am looking forward to our first trialogue meeting on 30 March. Then we will be ready to present our draft budget for 2012.</p>

    <intervention id="4-038-000" speaker_id="96816" name="Giovanni La Via" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the guidelines we are shortly to vote on are the first step towards the European budget for 2012. Since the beginning, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has shown its support for a preliminary report containing an indication of Parliament’s priorities for the forthcoming budget, which would then be presented to the Commission, as is done by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our contribution has helped broaden the scope of the priority policies and supported the balanced foundations laid by the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, by inserting a number of strong and distinctive priorities that express the traditions of the PPE Group, namely development and growth for Europe together with research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, I think these are the policies that we should invest in for the future of the Union and that Parliament really ought to stress before the preliminary draft budget is tabled by the Commission. As Mr Lewandowski correctly pointed out a short time ago, we also insisted that the concept of responsibility should be at the heart of the 2012 budget. This is not to say that until now we have not exercised budgetary responsibility, but it highlights the fact that now more than before, as a result of the crisis, we must act responsibly.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I think something needs to be said about what has happened and what is happening in many countries in North Africa, simply to show that we reject medium-term approaches that are incapable of properly dealing with unexpected events or new policies. In terms of the technical aspect of the vote, I think it would be worth leaving the report produced by the Committee on Budgets substantially unchanged. I am really puzzled by the insistence of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left on including the tax on financial transactions. Quite apart from the substance of the issue, to me it seems to be of no relevance to the 2012 budget procedure.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Balzani. She has chosen a very wise starting point for her report. It is short, specific and constructive and has a clear focus on the most important issues. What then are the most important issues? They involve demonstrating that the Europe 2020 Strategy is not just hot air, but a serious attempt to enable the EU to play a tangible role in promoting growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The EU’s budget is controversial, despite the fact that it is actually very small – around 1% of GDP or a little over 2% of overall public expenditure. However, it can play a strategic role when it comes to investments in projects that the Member States cannot manage by themselves or that require solidarity within Europe. These relate to research and development, infrastructure for transport and energy and being able to realise the true potential of the internal market – a well-functioning labour market in the EU and a real basis for growth and competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, these joint projects cost money. Evidence is therefore required, particularly on the part of the Member States and the Council. Will the Europe 2020 Strategy be put into practice, or will it go the way of the Lisbon Strategy – good ideas that are buried in an office drawer? I believe that the 2012 budget will be crucial in answering that question.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work. In times like these it is no easy task to set budgetary priorities. I am also pleased that we are choosing to be guided by Europe 2020 for next year’s budget. As was pointed out earlier, we cannot afford to wait until 2014 when the next budgetary framework enters into force to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission has an important responsibility to put forward proposals in its draft budget this summer. We have so far been unable to direct resources to the Europe 2020 Strategy to the extent that would be needed. There is a risk that it could turn out exactly as Mr Färm warned: that the strategy does not get implemented but gets stuck in an office drawer, which we do not want, of course.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My group tabled a number of amendments to the report and we are very pleased with the way in which they have been incorporated into the proposals. I would like to thank the rapporteur for that. I have to say to the Council that we in the European Parliament most certainly have reason to examine ourselves and the way that we are approaching the 2011 budget. We have succeeded in creating a conflict that has surely given both ourselves and the politicians in the Council cause for reflection.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must consider how we can make the best possible use of the resources we have. We may perhaps have to consider making cuts in the EU budget, too. At the same time, we must not forget that the Union has been given a large number of tasks that have to be fulfilled. These tasks will not do themselves. Sometimes I have the feeling that the Council believes that things can just happen by themselves without us having to reprioritise or earmark resources, but that is unfortunately not the case. I look forward to a constructive proposal from the Commission that can help us to find a more constructive tone in the negotiations on the 2012 budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report. I think that, unlike the other guidelines which we have discussed over many others years in this House, it is focused and it does not get into a whole lot of different details, which are obviously to come later in the budget procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly I would like to say that we in my group would like to take very much into account what is happening elsewhere in the European Union and not just keep it within the Brussels ‘Beltway’. Therefore the paragraph you have put in paragraph 21 – where you are saying that we should be looking for negative priorities and savings by the institutions, asking our specialised committees to be able to look for priorities – is very important, but very little work has been done on this so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tied in to the desire, which I can fully understand, to have more monies available for the Europe 2020 Strategy and the flagships, we should be looking not just for actions which involve money, but strengthening of the single market. It is not just about monies. Where we are looking for monies we should be thinking about where we can be generating savings from elsewhere in the budget, as we are looking to do in Parliament and in the other institutions. We take the line that if you want more money then you can take it from savings elsewhere. This should also be an important part of our approach to the 2012 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, therefore, in looking at the kind of responsibility we should take in an era of austerity, if we are going to be able to cope with the savings of financing where we need new expenditure my group believes we should be heading for a freeze in our expenditure for 2012.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are also of the opinion that when budgets are tight and there is a need for austerity policies we must respond, because we have to reduce levels of debt in the Member States. This is not the case on a European level, because fortunately we are not allowed to get into debt. However, the politically clever solution involves not only reducing debt but also achieving a balance, so that it is possible to invest in projects for the future in order not to put the national economy further at risk. Reaching this balance must be one of the guidelines for the European budget in 2012. In addition, we have made commitments in recent years in the European budget which come out of the structural funds and which will have to be financed next year and in the years that follow.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think we should take Mrs Balzani’s approach very seriously. It involves focusing on the most important areas of the EU 2020 Strategy, which determines where Europe is going. We are calling for more funding at a European level to allow us to combat climate change, to switch more quickly to renewable energy sources and to support education and research. We must continue to focus on these issues and we must not put this at risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also think that the European Semester mechanism is being used correctly to ensure that the Member States and the European budget, in other words a total of 28 budgets, commit to the targets in the EU 2020 Strategy. Where do we need to spend more money? On the basis of what we hope will be democratic change in the Arab countries, we Europeans have an interest in supporting civil society, democratic structures and the move to parliamentary democracy in these states and, therefore, we need flexible funding to promote democracy throughout the world in our own well-understood interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a Member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to ask specifically where we can make savings, in particular in the light of recent events in Japan. In my group we are of the opinion that we can save money on the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. We do not know what to do with the nuclear waste from this project. Why are we spending so much money on launching this project, when we should be redirecting the Euratom funding to enable us to move away from nuclear power and introduce renewable energy sources much more quickly? When we look at the United Nations and at climate policy, we all know that we need to change the way we generate energy. The 2012 European budget must also make a contribution in this area. I hope that we will have the power to make qualitative changes of this kind in the next multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, while we are here discussing the guidelines for the next budget, out there are tens of thousands of workers sending us a very clear message. They are telling us that the EU’s austerity policies are killing the economy and destroying the benefits and the conditions of life for the European public. They are telling us that the model of economic coordination that is being imposed is based on fines and penalties that provide no guarantee of sustainable growth and job creation – quite the contrary, in fact.</p>
      <p sl="pt">They are telling us that the Pact for the euro, which the governments are adopting today, is a pact that is against wages and pensions. It is a pact that is continuing to make the workers pay for the cost of the crisis, although it was not caused by them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that we should listen to this protest, because it poses a key question from the point of view of the European budget about the place of public investment in discussions about economic policies. We have heard the conservatives say that what we need is a ‘zero budget’, with a ‘zero increase’. We have heard various governments saying that, in the name of austerity policies, we need a European budget with a ‘zero increase’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The discussion that we are having today is crucial, but this is the wrong answer. It is the wrong answer for one simple reason: it is impossible to have ever stronger austerity policies at a national level yet at the same time say that due to these austerity policies we need ever weaker European budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This reasoning inevitably leads to only one outcome: lower public investment at both national and European level. It also means more unemployment and more social regression. This is the crucial discussion to be held in talks on the 2012 budget. It argues against those who think that the crisis can be resolved by heightening inequality and transforming the recession itself into a policy. This is what my group is opposing. We are going to abstain from this report because it is full of good intentions, but it does not respond in a clear way to this challenge, and the world of work requires a response from us on this matter.</p>

We should remember that the only information available is on the integrity and efficiency with which European Union funds have been spent. The attempt to justify an increase in the budget on the basis that the Europe 2020 Strategy will take us out of the crisis lacks all credibility when we look back at the complete failure of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The threat – and it is a threat – that limiting the level of the European Union budget will have a detrimental effect on European solidarity and the pace of economic development in the Member States is both facile and displays an overwhelming ignorance of the impact of the crisis upon European citizens.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my opinion on three areas of Mrs Balzani’s report. The first is that the report on the 2012 budget is based on the assumption of enhanced economic governance involving the EU, the European Semester mechanism and the Europe 2020 objectives to boost growth and employment. In next year’s budget there will be support in particular for two headline targets in the strategy: improving education and promoting social inclusion, which for me are two key aspects with regard to Europe’s future viability.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the report emphasises the need to improve synergies between European and national public investments in order to achieve the EU’s political objectives more effectively. We need to encourage more coordination, greater consistency and a focus on sensible, shared objectives in order to make it more likely that the headline targets can be achieved successfully.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point concerns climate change and energy targets. In the light of the disaster in Japan, we need to do everything possible to speed up the introduction of renewable energy sources. An active climate policy and the creation of green jobs will not only help us to achieve our climate targets, but will also make a positive contribution to social policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last but not least I would like to remind the House that the EU budget is not permitted to show a public deficit, which is why it is essential that it is implemented properly, and that it makes up only 2% of total public spending.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Mrs Balzani for the flexibility she has shown.</p>
      <p sl="es">I say this because the original idea was not to hold this debate on budget guidelines. I believe, however, that it is a good idea, because it will help to define the priorities that will shape the budget negotiations over the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="es">I should like to touch on two fundamental matters. First of all, austerity. Austerity is not a principle, it is an instrument. It is an instrument for achieving a truly credible budget that will not lead us to the consequences that are now materialising in many countries: that is, spending beyond our means and later encountering serious political difficulties when it comes to closing the gaps in the budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also believe we should not bring matters into the annual budgetary procedure which actually have a multiannual financial scope. I am referring, for instance, to the issue of the tax or levy on financial transactions. This belongs in a far wider financial framework, so any attempt to artificially bring this debate into the annual budget will only lead to a misguided strategy of negotiation with the Council right from the start.</p>
      <p sl="es">Only last year we saw what happens when we bring into a single-reading annual budget procedure, policies or ideas that actually have a wider scope: failure, stalemate and, ultimately, a situation – as we are now experiencing in 2011 – in which the level of credit appropriations is, as the Commissioner is perfectly well aware, insufficient to cover the immediate short-term needs of the European Union over the coming months.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are debating the need to make savings in view of the debt crisis that we are experiencing in the Member States. Mrs Trüpel and others have quite rightly pointed out that this debt crisis affects us only indirectly, as it is not permitted for debts to be incurred at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet how can we pursue an austerity policy in the European Union if the volume of European expenditure is only 2% of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States? I believe that this is not an austerity policy at all. Instead, it is a question of symbols – symbols that are in some way passed to us by the Member States as if money that is transferred to Brussels for the European budget in effect disappears into a deep black hole. This completely ignores the fact that the funds that go into the European budget actually go back to the Member States again. Of course, they do not go back at a ratio of 1:1, as Europe is not a savings bank, and we naturally pursue a policy of solidarity where we support those in the European Union that are less well developed. For example, in my state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, all of the labour market instruments that are now implemented there are cofinanced by the European Social Fund. If we remove this funding, there will be correspondingly less labour market policy. That cannot be what Social Democrats are aiming for.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us consider for a moment how the Member States spend European funds. The Court of Auditors’ annual report states that there are deficiencies in the way the management and control systems for spending European funds operate. It states that the recovery of wrongly invested funds in the Member States runs into billions of euro. It also states that the Commission is now, thankfully, going to suspend payments in cases where European programmes are being mismanaged. That is also happening for example in Germany and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council, which is not here, represents the Member States, which I urgently call on to improve their management of EU budgetary resources. The increase in efficiency that this would make possible would allow us to considerably improve the way we spend EU funds – not by spending more money but by improving the way we spend it. The Member States can play a part in this in order to underline their willingness to make savings.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Balzani. I think she has a very exciting, but also very difficult task in negotiating this budget, and that is because the framework is tight. The seven-year framework for the EU’s budget is devised in such a way that the framework becomes steadily tighter during the course of the seven-year period, particularly in the area of agriculture. We have actually been able to utilise unused agricultural funds almost as a means of financing new initiatives such as energy investments for the recovery package and the satellite navigation system Galileo. It is therefore becoming more and more difficult to ensure consistency. I do not agree with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that we should not finance the ITER fusion energy system. This is important research, particularly in the light of what has happened in Japan and against the background of the need to ensure that we are not dependent on fossil fuels. Thus, this is also a difficult task. We must find funding for the fusion energy project in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am pleased that the Commissioner emphasised the fact that the EU’s budget is not the same as national budgets. It is a project budget, and the EU must be able to settle its accounts. We must pay out the money that we have promised. In this regard, I hope that the Commissioner is right that our budget negotiations will be smoother this time around. That will require the Council to behave in a more intelligent and less stupid way – for it to give us a very definite figure for the payments, but to be more specific and look at what the real needs are.</p>
      <p sl="da">Last but not least, I would like to thank the Commissioner for stating that we must cut our administrative expenditure, because this is one of the few areas where we actually can save money in the short term. I think it is good that he started by saying that the Commission is reducing its administrative expenditure to next to nothing. That is something we should also do in other institutions, and I believe that it is something that we really should take seriously – also in Parliament.</p>

On the other hand, we must not continue with the disputes we saw when approving the 2011 budget. We must not allow the creation of a temporary budget. That would have a very negative effect on the running of the EU. In order to avoid disputes and approve the budget quickly, we need to propose a sensible budget, which, in the current period of lingering economic crisis, means a tight budget. The public in the Member States expect that, in a time of spending cuts, the EU too will run its affairs well and frugally. If we lose sight of this, we will lose credibility.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we are having our say in this debate in order to show that there is an alternative to the consensus between law and democratic socialism, which has brought this crisis upon us. This consensus does not, in itself, allow for any possibility of ending the crisis. The alternative, which is both possible and necessary, is also undergoing profound changes due to EU budgetary policies, reconsidering the resources and objectives which these serve.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At a time when inequalities between the different Member States are growing, the EU budget should be at the service of real convergence, promoting the full exploitation of the actual potential of each country, the creation of employment with rights, the eradication of poverty and social exclusion, and the preservation of the environment. It should be a tool at the service of genuine economic and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We reject a budget which is at the service of the commercialisation of more and more aspects of social life, liberalisation in numerous areas of economic activity, and lack of job security, as advocated by the Europe 2020 Strategy. This path will accentuate the existing economic, social, regional and national divisions and disparities, and foment structural unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore propose a new European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development, underpinned by a new set of economic, social and environmental policies, supported by the EU budget, as we explained in our set of proposed amendments to this report. The Union budget should also be at the service of a genuine policy of development aid, cooperation and peace, not at the service of external interventionism, interference, militarism and war, areas that have taken an increasing toll on the Community budget.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would therefore like to point out the urgency of steering Europe along a different course, and this should also be reflected in budgetary decisions.</p>

      <p sl="it">For example, the Europe 2020 Strategy is mentioned a number of times. It is an ambitious, wasteful and perhaps overly broad strategy. What in any case are supposed to be its priorities? It is the Member States themselves that have to come to terms with restricted budgets and the consequences of the crisis; we cannot be so naïve as to the think that we can do much at a European level. Therefore I would have preferred to see fewer statements of intent and fewer words and instead an indication of a few limited and precise areas in which to act.

The ruling Socialist and Christian Democrat clique is making sure there is a continuing majority in Parliament who are in favour of wasting even more money.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A nice sum of EUR 3 000 per member for a staff allowance, a good job on the side in the House of European History (for those fortunate enough to have the right connections), a totally unnecessary and terribly expensive European TV channel, a prestigious satellite project called Galileo, all of which is leading increasingly to financial disaster.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the last few speeches, I recommend that we try to return to the grounds of reason. The rapporteur was in no easy situation when she was preparing her material. After all, we can not yet talk about figures in any meaningful way until the Commission presents to us the boundaries within which it foresees the budget for the next year. We can, however, talk about principles. And in this regard, the rapporteur partially approached the matter very aptly, in that she attempted to integrate the 2020 policy within the bounds of the budget. On the other hand, her decision to not yet get involved in policies at this stage, and to not talk about their outlines and objectives either, indeed justifies certain critical comments that the material seems somewhat hollow.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that we can still all agree that, similar to previous years, we continue to consider cohesion policy extremely important. This policy will only really swing into motion now, at the end of the cycle, and it is here that the greatest payment requests will appear. I would very much like to stress, contrary to others, that these payments are not for their own sake, and that this is not about spending the money, but rather about using it in ways which actually further the European cause, and bring us forward in assisting less developed regions in catching up. If they are not doing this, they are doing wrong. Then Parliament must indeed step up against any kind of inappropriate spending and spending in the nature of prestige investments. I believe that the Committee on Budgets, in cooperation with the committees, is handling this twofold fight quite well. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the consistency of her draft resolution on the general guidelines for the 2012 budget. This resolution sends a clear political message. It is because it is fully aware of the budgetary constraints affecting the European Union that Parliament is today calling for the adoption of a 2012 budget that can respond to the political, economic and social challenges we currently face.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when the sole topic of discussion among the Member States is the implementation of additional austerity measures, Parliament, at least on this side of the House, intends to demonstrate its commitment to the thousands of workers who, today, are marching through the streets of Brussels to show their rejection of these economically questionable and socially unjust measures, the result of which will be a further increase in structural unemployment in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that the European budget is being aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy, in a clear way for the first time in 2012, means that employment and growth can be put back at the heart of European policies, which I would point out are our priorities, since the EU 2020 Strategy has set the objective of an employment rate of 75% of the working population.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, let us not delude ourselves. This budgetary procedure will be a long and difficult one, contrary to what Mr Lewandowski indicated in the French press when he anticipated the position of the MEPs. The Member States have already expressed their short-term view of the budget, which advocates discipline, and have called for a limit on their contribution to financing Community action. They see the European Union and its action not as a means to achieve added value or as a means to help it achieve ambitious policies, but rather as an additional cost. Let us not be mistaken. The 2012 budgetary procedure will provide another insight into the tactics being used to define the future multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact is, with a budget which accounts for a mere 2% of the EU’s public expenditure, it will be difficult to pursue ambitious policies in all sectors. We are already seeing stormy debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered. This pits citizens against each other when it would be to our credit to help them work in synergy. That is why, Commissioner, I would reiterate the importance of your communication on the implementation of own resources.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Refusals by various Member States, such as my home country, the Netherlands, to pay these bills are therefore nothing more than a reaction by unreliable governments. This is the same as if somebody who is having their house built accepted the offer and then refused to pay the final bill. Obviously, in the final stage, you can look at where you can make savings and we in Europe have to do that as well. In recital 21, in particular, Mrs Balzani has rightly pointed to that fact.

The two arms of the budgetary authority have therefore gained a clear picture of the deficiencies and positive developments with regard to the existing multiannual programmes. The 2012 appropriations must enable the accomplishment of EU goals and priorities in relation to the 2020 Strategy. That is because it is this that facilitates Europe emerging from the crisis strengthened. The promotion of employment, innovation, research and development, the facilitation of goals related to energy strategy and of social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The 2020 Strategy can of course only be credible if it receives appropriate funding. We would like to remind everyone that Parliament has raised this serious political concern on several occasions. Now we must call on the Member States and the Council to take responsible and decisive steps. We must not be content with a lesser Europe in a world where natural disasters and economic crises can ruin the lives of millions without warning, where the impact of such tragedies not only affects one country, people or religious community, but has an effect on entire regions and across oceans.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation in the 27 Member States. For this reason, we will certainly not be able to afford to do everything that we would like to do. I believe that the report tabled by Mrs Balzani is a workable compromise. However, I also have a few critical remarks to make.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, more money does not necessarily mean more solidarity and more Europe. What is important is to improve the quality of what we get in return for the money spent and above all to ensure that the objectives we set ourselves are actually achieved rather than the money merely being paid out regardless. We must always examine the question of our potential new own resources with a critical eye, too. These own resources must not lead to the additional burdening of citizens or of businesses that need to be, and should be, able to compete with the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also think it is important for us not always to emphasise the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 2% because, at the end of the day, many States cofinance the corresponding European funds, thus, of course, making a considerably larger volume of funds available on the basis of EU programmes. I think it is particularly important for us to make progress in terms of research, education, sustainability and strengthening economic growth. In light of this, I think it is also important for large-scale projects such as ITER – and in this regard I would like to thank Mrs Jensen for her comment – to be fully and clearly financed and clearly managed, because otherwise the Americans, who are currently implementing the same project, will be appreciably ahead of us, and we Europeans should not always take second place.</p>

I believe that the general approach that is being adopted is actually too general. I think that this is more of a resolution for an EU 2020 Strategy than proper guidelines for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In 2011 the priority has been on young people, and this will no longer be the case in 2012 with these guidelines. However, there is still time. The phrase ‘young people’ does not appear a single time in these general guidelines. Moreover, the focus on the Europe 2020 Strategy, which I support, does lead to cohesion policy, for example, being forgotten. Neither is there a single mention of cohesion policy. Cohesion policy is extremely important, and it cannot be a measure for adapting, or a measure or policy which suffers, for example, if money is taken from it in order to be given to the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is not a single mention of the cohesion policy, which we believe to be extremely important. I believe that there is time to remedy this omission, as I see it. I believe that there is still time to resolve these two issues.</p>

The 2012 and 2013 budgets will be consolidation budgets aimed at reflecting the Member States’ spending cutbacks and setting a benchmark for amounts that will be established in the next financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="it">The contribution of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to the guidelines for the 2012 budget was based on the concept of responsibility, which means pursuing the aims of economy, efficiency and effectiveness using as little as possible of the available resources.</p>

The Union’s priorities need a suitable level of funding. It is therefore important to ensure flexibility between the expenditure headings in order to more effectively counter the problems linked to the economic crisis and also to propose a budgetary framework that includes own resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I am not in favour of these resources being raised via the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, as proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the budget is a key instrument for European integration, and how it is set therefore matters.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is precisely in a time of crisis that the EU budget can contribute to mitigating the restrictive budgetary policies of national governments and direct funding towards desirable long-term investment projects. In this context, I welcome the fact that the report supports the plan to introduce project bonds, for example, in the area of infrastructure. I would like to point out, however, that they should not be regarded as an alternative to Eurobonds. In my opinion, Eurobonds are a special topic and I support their introduction, as they are a logical continuation of the integration process and they mark a deepening of the process.</p>
      <p sl="sk">An opposite tendency – towards disintegration – would result from, for example, attempts to slash EU budget levels. In addition to the unfavourable economic impacts, these attempts also undermine solidarity between Member States. The selfish and short-sighted division into net contributors and net beneficiaries ignores the deeper and more important context of European integration. All Member States can profit from this equally. In my opinion, this is the angle to take in discussions on the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, we are addressing the 2012 budget priorities with an eye to the future as well, and in my opinion we should therefore also look at the possibilities for making savings in the future.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my view, it is very important to think about the regular journeys made by MEPs and the entire European Parliament to Strasbourg, which is repeated 12 times a year. I believe that we irritate our citizens with these activities, because taxpayers have to finance our trips, and it costs them a great deal of money. We should therefore, if not in 2012, at least in the long-term perspective, look at the possibility of scaling back or modifying this mechanism in the future.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another potential saving which should be discussed, I think, is the cost of setting up the museum of the European Union or of Europe, which, from a time perspective, could be postponed until a future date, I believe, when the EU is faring better. At present we could transfer this funding to other activities, especially in 2012, in order to fulfil the 2012 programme, and thereby also improve the efficiency of our operations, of course.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would first like to applaud the work of the rapporteur, who has correctly identified numerous problems in her report.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EU budget for 2012, but also for the following years, should be ambitious, if we want to fulfil the tasks and objectives of the 2020 Strategy, emerge victorious from the crisis and compete globally. I support the budget committee proposal for meetings to be organised with national parliaments with the aim of discussing the outlines of EU and Member State budgets for 2012. It should be emphasised at these meetings that the EU budget must not be in deficit, that it represents only 2% of overall public spending in the EU and that there are fundamental differences between Member State budgets and the EU budget. The EU budget largely covers investment in the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Council, above all, should be aware of this, since we have already heard the representatives of Germany, France and Great Britain talk about trying to freeze the EU budget, through which we would surely slow down European growth.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will address three points only. On the 2020 Strategy adjustment, a clear point in Ms Balzani’s guidelines: in the current 2011 budget, 41% of expenditure could be attributed to the goals of the 2020 Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same effort is being made for the 2012 Strategy, but we must make the readjustment effort within the framework which was agreed several years ago, the 2007-2013 framework. It is, of course, limiting our room for manoeuvre that the adjustment must be done within the framework of the multiannual agreement dated 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, my reaction to Mr Elles – but not only to him: the same remark about negative priorities was also made by Mr Geier and Ms Hohlmeier. I am afraid that this is a true story about 2012’s budget. It should be like that. This time more than ever, in addition to positive priorities, we should examine what is not performing. We are looking at what is not performing, what is not properly administered in order to find savings. We are thinking as much about positive priorities this time as about negative priorities. For the administration, austerity is a must.</p>
      <p sl="en">My response to Mr Herczog about the waste of money: administration accounts for only 5.7% of the total budget of the European Union. This is a lower proportion than in the municipalities of Rotterdam and many other Dutch cities famous for a frugal approach to budgeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to Ms Andreasen: she was not only talking about freezing the budget. She was talking about cutting it. Our budget, the European budget, which is without deficit, cannot be blamed for the mismanagement of public finances in many Member States. It has its logic, as so clearly explained by Mr Gerbrandy. The logic is all about the maturity of programmes with time. This is not surprising. This is our credibility. The European budget has its own credibility which is all about commitments and accomplished projects paying out. Even in times of austerity, you have to pay your electricity bills.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is really about our credibility. This is about cohesion. This is really an investment, and its nature therefore probably also responds to some of the calls by those who are now demonstrating outside Parliament and the Berlaymont building.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the word ‘responsibility’ has been mentioned a number of times during the speeches. There is, however, one responsibility that I really think takes priority for the institutions: above all we are responsible for implementing our programmes and ensuring that EU citizens are not left with just our words. We have the responsibility to be consistent in what we say and what we promise.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today’s major projects are those set out in the 2020 Strategy. The first target of ‘more work’ is not only very ambitious but also very precise, since it can even be measured using unemployment reduction parameters. This seems to me to be a very specific and very ambitious goal and I think it is essential to start working to achieve it.</p>
      <p sl="it">As long as we continue to consider the 2020 Strategy as too big and too ambitious to be squeezed into a practical document like the budget, I think we will achieve nothing more than increasing the risk of another failure, which is exactly what nobody wants, starting with the Commission, if I remember the first communication on the 2020 Strategy correctly.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is, however, another important issue: austerity is not a policy, it is not an instrument, it is a condition against which we must take action, and not only by consolidating our expenditure, but also by using the European budget, an extraordinary instrument that is radically different from the national budgets and gives us the chance to do something different this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is precisely what the European Semester is for. Clogging up the first six months of the year is not its only use. It enables us to come up with a global strategy and to create synergies; and creating synergies between the budgets of the Member States and our budget is an extraordinarily European system to give more value to public resources and to create a real method to turn the 2020 Strategy – long and ambitious as it is – into a European reality.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately this report advocates ‘a 2012 budget under the auspices of enhanced European economic governance, the European Semester mechanism and Europe 2020 objectives’. In other words, this is a budget which supports the deepening of neoliberalism, militarism and federalism in the EU through the adoption of profoundly anti-social and anti-democratic measures, the firm establishment of the Stability Pact, the enforcing of brutal fines on the Member States and permanent monitoring of all national macroeconomic activity. This is also a proposal which seeks to achieve a budget that facilitates liberalisation, job insecurity, and an attack on rights and public services.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore propose an important set of changes, aimed not only at denouncing this approach, but also at presenting guidelines for an alternative which is both possible and necessary. These proposals are crucial in order to improve the situation of unemployment, poverty and inequality which exists and is worsening with capitalism, of which the EU is a tool. The EU budget needs to be based on another vision in order to address the economic and social crisis, rejecting the neoliberal path, so-called economic governance and the strengthening of militarism.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In her report on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, Mrs Balzani set out the five key budget priorities of the EU. I fully support her view that it is the Europe 2020 Strategy that should help Europe overcome the global economic crisis and emerge stronger from the crisis through the creation of new jobs based on the five priorities, that is, support for employment, improved conditions for innovation, research and development and the provision of funding for these from the public purse, the fulfilment of objectives on climate change and energy, higher levels of education and support for social inclusion, and, above all, reduction of poverty in Europe. However, if we want to be successful and to implement this strategy in earnest, we must assign sufficient funding for it, without substantial compromises or cuts. The current multiannual financial framework now offers very little room for manoeuvre, and I therefore agree with the rapporteur that further attempts to limit or cut budgetary resources related to the fulfilment of key priorities are simply out of place at the moment. I support the rapporteur’s idea that the fulfilment of key priorities can work as a catalyst for boosting investment, growth and job creation throughout the Union. In general, I agree with the proposed guidelines and I recommend the approval of this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Across Europe governments and public authorities are having to find ways to save money and show restraint. My own country, Scotland, was hit by a double whammy – a global recession exacerbated by misrule by governments in London, always willing to plunder Scotland’s resources but intent on denying the people of Scotland control over their own affairs. The Scottish government has therefore had to work extra hard to succeed in maintaining Scotland’s vital public services. In these economic circumstances it is wholly unrealistic for this house to call for a budgetary increase – Europe’s public services must have priority over the operations of the EU’s institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one of the inherent problems of a single currency which has a number of different Member States, with economic cycles at different rates, is that it is pointless having one set of interest rates if you have different spending decisions. The result of that has obviously come to bear, because we can see the problems that the euro zone is in. On top of that, governments have to understand that they cannot spend more money than they get in revenue. When governments do that and cook the books, or do not fulfil the roles of economic governance and economic discipline, the others get into trouble.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we want a strong euro zone, especially for those members outside the euro zone. We want to continue to trade with countries in the euro zone. We do not benefit from a weaker euro. However, at the same time, we have to be quite clear that the countries in the euro zone should fight their own problems themselves, and not rely on others. I wish you luck in the euro zone, but please learn the lessons of not spending more money than you earn.</p>

The second, in specific terms, reaffirms the principle that outstanding commitments – which are particularly high in the cohesion sector – ought to be carried out and not, as the Council suggests, simply cut out. The third sets out some doubts – entirely reasonably in my view – as to the effectiveness of an estimate criterion based on performance in the previous year. The fourth urges the Commission to formulate proposals for the creation of new resources and, in particular, new resources must be designed to combat the persistent effects of the crisis with a robust and effective commitment to policies for innovation, research and growth in economic, productive and employment terms across Europe.</p>

There is certainly a recurring problem here, though, and that is the lack of a firm legal status for immigrants and, as a result, the possibility of discrimination against them. It is not normal to have a situation where, in the 21st century, we still see incidents which essentially involve slavery. Everyone must be treated equally in the labour market. This report contained the provisions that are currently lacking in our framework of standards, and I therefore supported the creation of a legal framework in this area, something which I consider to be very important.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is without doubt also necessary to have legal certainty and transparency in respect of the decisions taken by the competent national bodies when handling these applications.

We have to ensure that human rights in the European Union are implemented in such a way that workers coming here from third countries also receive the same pay and the same levels of social security, and that the same conditions of employment apply to them as well as the other employees. This is obviously a basic consideration.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am rather worried about one matter concerning the report, although I did vote in favour of it. This is the scope of application of Article 3, which still does not cover posted or seasonal workers or intra-corporate transferees from third countries. It is to be hoped that progress will be made on this, so that everyone will be considered equally in this single permit package.

Thirdly, I believe that old-age benefits are a component of a person’s wages and, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, it should be possible to transfer them according to the rules of the Member States, provided that this only happens if the third country is also happy for this to be done and if it actually transfers them.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the reform of the directive on consumer rights has been a long and sporadic process. The Commission’s original idea for full-scale harmonisation threatened to impair levels of consumer protection, particular that of consumers in the Nordic countries. This would have been contrary to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, according to which consumer legislation must be based on levels of consumer protection that are as high as possible. We should therefore always remember that the markets are for consumers, and it is not the case that consumers are for the markets.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Legislation on consumers and small entrepreneurs must always be as clear as possible and easy to understand.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, up until now the internal market of the European Union has been developed on the terms of mainly large companies. Now it is time to turn our attention to small and medium-sized enterprises and, above all, consumers, to ensure that their interests in the internal market are more vigorously protected. This Commission proposal to reform consumer protection has met with a fairly controversial reception. In Finland, for example, the Consumers’ Association collected signatures on a petition, stating that the proposal, if it had gone ahead, would have harmed consumer protection in Finland irreparably.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This compromise we have now voted on, which will go for further discussion, is very obscure. A large number of the original proposals have been cut out, with the result that it is in no way ambitious. The biggest problem, however, is that it is actually hard to understand. I would like to make it a condition that the directive on consumer rights should be one that consumers also understand, thus offering them protection.</p>

As Finns and Nordic people, we are worried that consumer protection might be impaired. Full harmonisation would mean just that, especially as far as the Nordic countries are concerned. Moreover, it would delay measures in those countries where things at present are hardly perfect.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is excellent that this proposal is being referred back to committee, because it contains certain slightly problematic points, particularly for small entrepreneurs. I would like the Committee to focus attention on one small issue. Amendments 18 and 107 suggest that this would have a very negative impact on travel companies in northern Finland, for example. Frequently a decision to go to a company, hotel or tourist accommodation is made on the road, and people call and book. Under this directive, that would not be enough: people would have to send a fax or something similar. This is not always possible in practice. This issue should be approached at the level of the public, and the different situations in the various Member States need to be understood.</p>

That will bring certainty not only for consumers, but also for producers.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am particularly pleased about the improvements in the information requirements for door-to-door selling and for distance contracts. In future debates – and I am therefore very pleased that this report has been referred back to committee once again – we should ensure that, when we talk about producers, we do not just consider the large corporations but also the small family businesses, and we should not overburden them with legal subtleties.</p>

Increasing the duty-free tariff rate quota for wine and extending the validity of Council Regulation No 55/2008 until the end of 2015 would help this country where the number of workers in the wine industry has risen to 300 000 and the agricultural sector accounts for 40% of GDP, without affecting the Union’s economy at the same time.

I also welcome and am voting in favour of this draft legislative resolution to extend Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 until 31 December 2015, and I hope that a ‘deep and comprehensive free trade area’ will be set up between the EU and the Republic of Moldova by that date.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report approves a Commission proposal to authorise the increase in the duty free tariff quota for Moldovan wine. The Commission is proposing an increase in the quota from 100 000 hl to 150 000 hl in 2011, from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl in 2012, and from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year.

These difficulties are exacerbated by changes introduced with the reform of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) and the planned aim of production rights.

Attention is drawn to the fact that such regulation will not have a negative impact on the EU’s wine industry. Moldova is one of Europe’s poorest countries, facing major economic and political problems. The EU should create favourable conditions for Moldova to choose an appropriate geopolitical direction that would help address the country’s difficulties.

Within the scope of this neighbourhood policy, Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces a specific system of autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova, which provides free access to the EU market for all products from Moldova, with the exception of certain agricultural products listed in its annex, for which limited concessions have been given either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas, or in the form of lower customs duties.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One of the exceptions to free movement is focused on the wine industry, with the implementation of a tariff quota that, according to the available data, has been fully used up months before the end of the year. Given the fact that the economy of Moldova is being heavily hit by the negative effects of the global financial and economic crisis, and that its wine sector employs about 300 000 workers, this report, which I voted for, proposes the increase of the current tariff quota for wine in order to support Moldova’s efforts and to provide an attractive and viable market for its wine exports, which, moreover, do not compete with Portuguese products.</p>

      <p sl="it">We are all convinced that since its creation the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) has been one of the key European Union trade and development policy instruments. It has represented a major incentive for developing countries, long embroiled in the fight against poverty, to favour free access to their market and imports of their goods via tariff reductions. However, we agree with the rapporteur, Mr Scholz, who has expressed hope that the current Regulation on the subject will need to be extended, since this would ensure legal certainty and guarantee the interests of both the EU and the beneficiary countries and also avoid the current situation (which is still unsatisfactory) being extended. So far we have seen a certain underuse of the trade preferences guaranteed by the GSP, above all those related to the rules of origin, caused by a problem in the administrative procedures that characterise them. It would therefore be advisable to provide targeted technical assistance, for instance by operating twinning programmes, with the principal aim of promoting the development of regulatory capacities and guaranteeing the proper transposition of the international conventions. Finally, we are of the opinion that the Commission should carry out constant monitoring, with greater involvement from Parliament and the relevant social partners.</p>

EU trade policy has an essential part to play in combating poverty and achieving the Millenium Development Goals. The EU’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is one of the tools that enables developing countries to compete on the international markets by offering either reduced customs duties or zero-rate access to the EU market for their exports. The GSP also releases countries from dependency on aid. We have approved the extension of the current regulation while we await the new draft regulation that has been requested in order to guarantee legal certainty. However, the European Parliament’s new powers in the field of trade following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon must be taken into account. Under the Treaty, measures in the GSP Regulation are considered to be delegated acts, which means that the European Parliament will have greater supervisory powers in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">As long ago as 1964, some developing countries were already calling loudly for trade preferences in order to improve their economic situation. In 1968, after an agreement was reached, a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) was introduced. The European Economic Community introduced the GSP in 1971 and other nations like the United States followed suit. The temporary granting of trade preferences sought to achieve the following goals: an increase in developing countries’ export proceeds by diversification of the exported products, promotion of industrialisation and an acceleration of economic growth in the developing countries. Furthermore, the GSP was intended to ensure that the products supported originated in developing countries. To date, the GSP represents one of the most important EU instruments in the area of trade and it is monitored by the European Commission. As the current scheme expires on 31 December of this year, the Commission already presented a new proposal back in May 2010. No amendments are proposed for the new regulation, although the rapporteur definitely believes that a redrafting of the schemes is necessary. I am abstaining from the vote because there do not seem to be any new, tangible proposals for the new regulation.</p>

I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a new regulation on this subject because I agree with the objectives of the changes it aims to bring in. The amendment aims to create an effective system that is more sensitive to the interests of the beneficiary countries and economic operators, to develop more comprehensive rules and to guarantee Parliament’s role as the body of democratic control. I hope that this is the first step towards a solution to be identified at a global level for a general agreement on trade.

      <p sl="pt">Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 established a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that is valid until 31 December 2011. The GSP has been one of the EU’s main trade and development policy instruments for helping developing countries to reduce poverty, by generating income through international trade. Parliament’s consultation process with regard to the latest GSP was insufficient, and did not allow for wide-ranging negotiation. Parliament emphasised that in future more time will be needed for it to carry out its functions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since 1971, the European Union has been awarding preferential trade arrangements to developing countries within the framework of its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP is applied through successive regulations implementing a system of generalised tariff-related preferences, generally for three years at a time. The current system was instituted by Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 and applies until 31 December 2011, when it will be replaced by a new regulation, yet to be drawn up. However, the remaining period of application of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 is not sufficient to allow a Commission proposal to be drawn up and a new regulation to be adopted by means of the Ordinary legislative procedure, so it would appear necessary to extend this regulation’s period of application until 31 December 2013, in order to ensure continuity in the functioning of the system.</p>

      <p sl="en">The idea of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) goes back to 1968, when tariffs were much higher in general and when they were still seen as the main barrier to trade from developing to industrialised countries. The concept was initially proposed by the UNCTAD as a development tool: industrialised countries should grant non-reciprocal trade preferences to developing countries, allowing them to generate revenue not via aid, but via international preferential trade. The European Community started to apply this scheme in 1971. The first three-year scheme was implemented from 2006 to 2008. The second scheme is due to expire on 31 December 2011. The current scheme was adopted in 2008 under the consultation procedure. However, at that time, the referral arrived in Parliament at very short notice. Meaningful Parliament involvement in the regulation was impossible. This should not happen again for the forthcoming regulation, in particular given Parliament’s new competencies under the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

The main aim is to eradicate endemic poverty everywhere, enabling countries in difficulty to draw the greatest benefits from international trade. Now the tariff agreement is close to expiry and the Commission has decided that the new proposal will be tabled in the coming months, though its entry into force will be delayed until at least the second half of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="it">This delay will result in a legal vacuum of more than six months, causing a discontinuity in the programme that even risks putting the many results already achieved under threat.

Tariff preferences should be beneficial to the whole of society and not just a certain number of companies. The rapporteur accurately observed that the proposal to extend the current regulation is not ideal, but it would allow us to avoid a legal vacuum lasting more than six months. Under the current regulation, the European Parliament has no say on the criteria for eligibility, or on the list of the beneficiary countries. This should change: The time has come for Parliament to make use of its new post-Lisbon powers in the trade arena. The EU should pay more attention to the development of cooperation with neighbouring countries in the area of trade policy. This would help establish a stable and liberal business environment and would facilitate the gradual enlargement of the European single market.

Opening the market to EU and US airlines on a non-discriminatory basis would offer passengers and freight operators improved services, in terms of both variety and cost, provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs. Regulatory convergence could do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies, social and environmental standards. While the second-stage Agreement represents a significant step forward, it is important for it not to be regarded as the end of the process of establishing a transatlantic aviation market. I believe that the Commission needs to look forward towards negotiating another stage of this Agreement covering issues including: further liberalisation of traffic rights; additional foreign investment opportunities; the effect of environmental measures and infrastructure constraints on the exercise of traffic rights; and better coordination of passenger rights policies in order to ensure the highest possible level of protection for passengers.

What I am not happy about, however, is the one-sided nature of this Agreement, in which the EU, on the one hand, is making numerous concessions, while the United States, on the other, is insisting on restrictions on foreign ownership, for example. The EU must put itself in a stronger position in relation the United States in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The open-skies agreement reached between the United States and the European Union is a guarantor of progress and a mirror of economic development for both regions. Fully opening the transatlantic market would represent an important step towards improving the situation in the global aviation sector. There would be an economic benefit for both parties worth millions, and many new jobs would be created, along with business development opportunities. While striving for economic benefits, we must not forget security requirements. Standards of flight safety and security are vitally important to passengers, crew and the whole aviation sector. Security standards must be harmonised in ascending order. EU and US institutions responsible for flight security must cooperate at all levels. EU security standards must meet the requirements set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. We must make every effort to ensure that our own lives, as well as those of our children and the loved ones, are taken seriously. We cannot allow the flying, working and rest time of flight crew members in the European Union to be subject to lower security requirements, which could endanger people’s lives.</p>

In any case, this process will not be straightforward, and any decision relating to it will depend on monitoring and the final proposal arrived at, under circumstances that are instrumental to ensuring improved air transport and the success of European companies.</p>

The EU should have the courage to link both of these issues – the visa requirement and the signing of the international agreement – as this may provide a rare opportunity to put effective pressure on Canada over the visa affair. It is astonishing that Canada, on the one hand, allows EU airlines to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in the EU, and, on the other hand, prevents the citizens of one Member State from travelling freely to Canada.

We therefore welcome the conclusion of this agreement tabled by the Commission, which aims to give all European Union air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes to and from Vietnam, while avoiding any anti-competitive practice. The clauses on possible fuel tax for air services ought to be removed and it would be desirable for the traditional designation clauses referring to air carriers of third countries to be replaced by a European Union designation clause referring to EU air carriers.

Notable among these are the peace processes in the Middle East, the war in Iraq, the situation in Iran, the popular uprisings in Yemen and the recent developments in Darfur, besides the latest events in North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the report notes that ‘the Gulf states’ sovereign wealth funds account for more than one third of the world total and those funds helped to rescue the global and European financial system’.

      <p sl="lt">By voting in favour of this report, I support the demonstrations for democracy and human rights in Bahrain and condemn the government’s violent response. The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, currently represent the EU’s sixth largest export market and the EU is currently the GCC’s main trading partner. Notwithstanding this already intensive level of trade, there is still scope for deepening it, as well as room for greater diversification of trade between the two parties, given the size of the EU market and efforts on the part of GCC member states to diversify their exports. A free trade agreement would also provide new opportunities for technical cooperation and assistance and the conclusion of the EU-GCC FTA would foster closer ties and further diversification. This document restates the EU’s opposition to the death penalty and calls for a global moratorium on it; deplores the continuing retention of the death penalty by all GCC member states; therefore invites them to adopt a moratorium on executions; and calls in particular on states practising executions and punishments involving methods such as decapitation, stoning, crucifixion, flagellation or amputation to cease these practices.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For various reasons, the Persian Gulf region is of strategic importance for the European Union, particularly in terms of energy supply. The European Union wants to enter into closer cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – an organisation made up of the six richest nations in the region – with the conclusion of a free trade agreement forming a key component of that process. I voted in favour of this report, which prepares the ground for future cooperation between the Union and the GCC. Covering all of the issues relevant to such a partnership, such as the rights of minorities, women’s rights, freedom of conscience and expression, but also support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and areas for strategic partnership such as research, education and fossil and renewable fuels, the motion proposed by my colleague, Mr Baudis, has achieved a fairly broad consensus among the political groups. However, recent events in Bahrain have given rise to concerns as to whether the report is sufficiently up-to-date. Goodwill on all sides has resulted in some excellent compromise oral amendments being negotiated, thereby bringing the report up to date and ensuring that months of hard work have not been in vain.</p>

Mr Baudis’ comprehensive report covers all the interesting issues concerning human rights, equal rights for women, freedom of the press and democratisation.

A strategic partnership in many areas, which is highlighted at many points in the report, should make it possible to avoid crises in relations between the EU and the region, and to increase Europe’s energy security. The Persian Gulf countries are extremely important players in the peace process. I would therefore like to say how pleased I am that the report was adopted, and I hope that cooperation between the European Union and the Persian Gulf countries will be even more productive in many areas.</p>

      <p sl="it">The conclusion of a free trade agreement remains both a political and a commercial priority. The GCC’s geopolitical environment is characterised by the emergence of a series of security challenges with global and regional implications that means that a process to liberalise and diversify the basic economic structure of these countries needs to be started up. These countries should be able to continue down the path of cooperation and multilateralism.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union therefore has the task of developing a new strategic partnership that is capable of supporting the ongoing regional integration process.

That is why Parliament is today called to formulate a more ambitious cooperation policy with the countries of the GCC. The EU has certain advantages to draw on in comparison with the new players operating in the Gulf, above all in terms of education, scientific research, energy and technology.

      <p sl="it">Concluding the agreement in question makes it possible to facilitate increased visibility for the Union by following a strategy of opening new European diplomatic missions in the Gulf states which would encourage political dialogue and make Europe’s efforts more effective. This also applies in terms of the EU’s energy needs, still largely met by fossil fuels, even though future oil demand will be influenced by a climate policy increasingly focussed on renewable sources. The social and political developments that have taken place in recent years in most Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states encourage the promotion of human rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination, including those based on gender, sexual orientation or religion. A reliable partnership between the EU and the GCC therefore needs to be built, which will favour open markets for goods and the removal of non-tariff barriers.</p>

Dialogue with civil society will also be a key and indispensable feature of each partnership. Whilst progress and reforms must be welcomed, a lot remains to be done in order to set these countries firmly on the road to democracy, respect for human rights and civil liberties. Part of Europe’s destiny is being played out in the Near and Middle East.

      <p sl="it">As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), I carefully followed the entire process leading to the creation of the European Banking Authority. For this reason, I voted in favour of the appointment of Mr Farkas as its executive director. The European Banking Authority must be put in a position to be able to start carrying out the tasks assigned to it by Parliament some months ago. I sincerely hope that the Authority is provided with the human and economic resources it needs so as to ensure that its supervisory role is implemented seriously and precisely. During the hearing held in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the new executive director convinced me and my colleagues of his competence and professionalism, as today’s vote shows. An additional positive factor, which will benefit the process of European integration, is that the new executive director comes from a Member State that only recently acceded to the European Union.</p>

In spite of the current economic and financial crisis, it is now important for us to lay the foundations for sound, future economic growth through investments in education, research and development, innovation and SMEs. These areas provide the basis for the EU’s progress and competitiveness and must be developed from the perspective of creating jobs and increasing territorial and social cohesion. I want to stress that we must not reduce the funding in these areas and it is vital for us to monitor constantly that the available resources are being managed with the utmost efficiency. I also believe that there is fundamental synergy between national budget priorities and the EU budget. I wish to take this opportunity to welcome President Herman Van Rompuy’s efforts as part of the European Semester to tighten EU Member States’ discipline by promoting clear targets which are measurable and realistic for every country.

      <p sl="nl">I cannot endorse the Balzani report. The first reason is the call for the introduction of a type of EU tax. The second reason concerns the economic crisis and the painful interventions being undertaken by Member States. The EU, too, must make efforts to ensure that its budget does not continue to run out of control and that it carries out the necessary cuts. With this in mind, I advocate a dynamic approach to tackling the ever growing gap between annual appropriations and the amounts being paid out. Limiting appropriations would lead to payments and appropriations becoming more closely aligned. I realise that multiannual programmes which are coming to an end because of the 2007-2013 Multiannual Framework will entail an increase in payments. I propose in that regard that, where some increase in payments is inevitable, it is offset by significantly lower appropriations. This also applies to budget lines for which implementation is lagging behind. These measures provide a logical and persuasive step towards a more realistic budget in difficult economic times.</p>

At the same time, next year’s EU budget must be the main instrument to bring about the European economy’s recovery, with great importance being attached to employment, economic governance and growth. I think that the 2012 budget must help implement the EU 2020 Strategy’s five objectives: employment, innovation, research and development, climate change and energy, education and social integration. The EU budget is a budget for investment and 2012 is the sixth year in the current ‘financial outlook’ (2007-2013), with projects rolling out at a regular rate, which results in an increase in payment levels as the work is carried out. In my view, an increase in payment levels is predictable in 2012.</p>

The EU 2020 objectives will only be achieved if there is strong governance and European coordination, and if the Member States make the investment needed to carry out their actions. However, this strategy can only be fully achieved if there is a new multiannual financial framework. This report neglects to mention the importance of cohesion policy even once.

Young people do not get a single mention in the report either, which is incomprehensible. This is the priority for the current budget proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE). Moreover, young people feature in the five objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy.

      <p sl="pl">Since the beginning of the year, the Committee on Budgets has been drafting the European Parliament’s priorities for the 2012 EU budget. Parliament’s position, which is necessary for talks with the EU Council, will be formulated on the basis of these priorities. It would appear that this year’s conciliation between Parliament and the Council will be even more challenging than was the case in 2010. The Council, which is opposed to any increase in the EU budget, has already announced its own savings plan, which is rather convenient, since it concerns budget lines which have not been fully exploited to date. At the same time, Parliament is in favour of an increase in the 2012 budget, but only in line with the Eurostat inflation rate. The latter is an objective rate which we cannot vote upon, as some people seem to believe. How can the European Parliament justify the proposed increase?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy, including the twin goals of increasing education and employment levels. Without adequate funding, these goals will remain defunct, and Europe 2020 will follow in the footsteps of the renowned and ineffective Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the EU budget is already bursting at the seams; the European External Action Service, the Galileo system, the Solidarity Fund and the Globalisation Fund are generating expenditure which it was impossible to predict six years ago, when the current financial perspective was negotiated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">While on the subject of rational expenditure, I would also call upon Members of this House to take a critical look at the ‘buildings policy’, which we cannot afford. One example of this would be the increase in office space announced for Brussels.</p>

Unlike some Council members who consider the EU to be an additional cost, an expense to be reduced at the risk of pitting current and future policies against each other, Parliament, through the resolution on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, has reiterated its vision of the Union as a vector of added value and an ally of Member States in implementing ambitious policies. Furthermore, I voted in favour of the resolution presented by Mrs Balzani because of its consistency and the clear political message it carries, calling for the adoption of a budget that is consistent with the objectives for employment and growth of the EU 2020 Strategy.

The contribution of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to the guidelines for the 2012 budget was based on the concept of responsibility, which means pursuing the aims of economy, efficiency and effectiveness using as little as possible of the available resources. The 2020 Strategy is based on important priorities – namely research, innovation, development and growth – that were not initially contained in the report by Mrs Balzani, but which have been strongly emphasised by the PPE Group, as well as achieving the employment objectives initially set out. The Union’s priorities in the budget require adequate financing and it is also important to ensure flexibility between the expenditure headings in order to more effectively counter the problems linked to the economic crisis, as well as to propose a budgetary framework that includes own resources.</p>

The fact is that the precarious budgetary situation of some Member States that have lived it up in the past has become a financial millstone around the necks of the other Member States in connection with the rescue package.

These fundamental requirements make it all the more important not only for the 2012 budget to be correctly executed – in which regard we must not overlook the fact that budgetary control still leaves a great deal to be desired – but also for us to manage our resources in an economical way. The reference here to ‘adequate financing’ of the Europe 2020 Strategy, when billions from the EU budget are still mysteriously disappearing and available opportunities for potential savings, for example in relation to the jungle of EU agencies or the locations for Parliament, are not utilised, represents a waste of European taxpayers’ money.

What is more, by voting in favour of the proposed ‘single permit’ for third-country nationals, the European right is voting for an immigration policy that is both discriminatory and restrictive. The text as it stands does not provide for equal treatment for all workers in terms of working conditions and social rights. It creates different categories of workers, by nationality and by type of contract, and this is simply unacceptable. We cannot compromise on equal treatment.

It should be understood that legal migrant workers make a contribution to the EU economy through their work and the taxes and social security contributions they pay, therefore they must be guaranteed the same minimum rights and be treated in the same way in the labour market. I would like to stress that it is impossible to create a two-tier labour market, either within the European Union itself or outside.

In actual fact, issuing a single document will also make it easier to check on people admitted to a Member State and authorised to work there.

The horizontal and framework character of the directive is unfortunately violated by the exemptions from the scope of the directive and variations regarding the rights of certain specific population groups. There has been an undermining of the principle of equal treatment for all third country workers legally working in the Union compared to EU citizens. This equality should be an expression of recognition of the benefit migrant workers bring to the EU economy through their work and also through their payment of taxes and social contributions. The accompanying effect should be a restriction on unfair competition, making the practice of illegal employment more difficult and preventing third country workers from becoming victims of exploitation and social exclusion. Contrary to the Commission proposal, it is therefore necessary to ensure that no specific group is excluded from the scope of the directive, and particularly not the group comprising temporary workers.

Different treatment has been adopted for European and non-European workers, thereby increasing competition between them and between foreign workers, depending on whether they are seconded or seasonal workers, students or residents. All these differences do is to increase exploitation and uncertainty. Despite moves by European trade unions and the progressive forces in Parliament to obtain full equality of rights for all workers, the text mainly reflects a compromise between the right and the socialists. The future directive will not apply to seconded workers or to students, will allow discrimination based on criteria such as knowledge of the language and will refuse family benefits to families of seasonal workers. Likewise, the call for the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrants and Members of Their Families has been removed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament has voted in favour of the principle of creating a single work and residence permit for third-country nationals in a Member State. This procedure provides a set of common rights for these workers, particularly with regard to working conditions, such as working time and holidays. The text also sets out the principle of reimbursing pension contributions already made by workers who leave the EU, since they will be unable to receive their pensions after they retire. This text is problematic, however, since it reinforces the ‘country of origin’ principle for some categories of workers, a principle that was fought by the European left during the time of the famous ‘Bolkestein’ Directive. This principle creates a kind of two-speed labour market depending on the worker’s origin, and contributes to a form of social dumping. There is a contradiction here: do we really want to protect the European social model, and should it exclude non-European workers, or should it take a universalist approach and stop discriminating against workers by giving them different rights?

Once a migrant enters the EU and starts working, he stops being a migrant and becomes a worker.

It was a commendable initiative at the beginning, but the text as it is contradicts the stated goals: it is both discriminatory, because the basic principle of equal treatment for all is not respected, and restrictive, since several categories of workers are excluded. In December 2010, Members of the European Parliament rejected the text for the first time. Despite the improvements made since then, there is a continued fear of social inequality among nationals of third countries. The text as it stands does not provide for equal treatment for all workers in terms of working conditions and social rights. It creates different categories of workers, by nationality and by type of contract, and this is simply unacceptable. We therefore voted against the final draft.

I believe, nevertheless, that Member States should be allowed, under certain conditions, to set limits to the capacity to accept citizens from non-EU countries and offer them a job in their area.

Its implementation has led to the increasingly advanced integration of a vast area of trade. However, that area still experiences unequal treatment between nationals of a Member State and those from third countries. This difference in treatment is a two-fold problem. It both penalises migrant workers, who do have the high expectations usually brought about by the social rights of Member States, and harms European workers who, faced with unfair competition, suffer from social dumping. The ‘single permit’ resolution, presented by Mrs Mathieu, specifically targets migrant workers’ rights.

Whereas in the United States, for example, they do not burden the social system, and in some States they also have to leave once their job comes to an end, through the increasing level of equality with the resident population that they have been afforded in recent years, they constitute an ever greater burden for those States with traditionally well-developed social systems if they remain in the country permanently after losing their jobs and if, as a result of them bringing any family they have to join them, all the relatives have to be supported, too.

The proposal adopted today also confirms full observance of the principle of subsidiarity, by setting minimum standards on rights and obligations, but leaving Member States the flexibility and freedom regarding the introduction of procedures in their national legislation and their practical application.

      <p sl="nl">Although the directive on a single application procedure for a residence and work permit is far from being ideal or complete, I voted in favour of it nonetheless. I regret the shortcomings concerning seasonal workers, posted workers, the right to change employer and the right to enter and re-enter, because these subgroups will be protected in other (future) legislation. All in all, this directive is extremely important given that it is the first of its kind to grant a common set of minimum rights (including salary rights, equal treatment at work, pension rights and access to health care) to workers from third countries who are legally resident in Europe, which it does on the basis of equal treatment with national workers of Member States. In addition, the directive provides for a system with a single simplified application procedure for a residence and work permit. This scheme is far from a complete common immigration policy, but in view of increasing immigration flows, the constantly changing demand for foreign labour and the prevention of abuse and discrimination in this regard, this first form of protection is essential. Third-country workers will now receive greater protection than has been the case. Taken as a whole, this was the deciding factor for my ‘yes’ vote.</p>

The creation of a single working document represents significant progress in the control and regulation of migration flows from Member States and will enable legal immigration to be monitored more easily. With this text, Parliament has stated that controlled, regulated immigration of workers is beneficial to all. Establishing a common legal framework for European and foreign workers protects our citizens against all forms of unfair competition in the labour market.

We will thus promote a level of consumerism that satisfies our citizens, who will find it easier to make purchases in other Member States.

This directive is aimed at combining EU legislation regulating consumer rights, safeguarding a high level of consumer protection across all EU Member States and encouraging businesses to provide services and sell goods in other Member States. Currently there remain obstacles to the smooth functioning of the market. Companies are not inclined to trade in other Member States and consumers are unlikely to award contracts due to the different rules that apply to consumer contracts in the Member States. Legislation in force until now set only minimum requirements for the protection of consumer rights, and the Member States were able to apply more stringent measures, thus leading to different legal regimes in the Community. I believe that it is necessary to review this directive again and strengthen its provisions. We must ensure that the same standards of consumer rights protection apply in all EU Member States, enabling us to avoid the inconsistency that currently exists in the internal market, strengthen consumer confidence in the internal market and encourage companies to trade in other Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">The proposal for a directive on consumer rights presented by the Commission combines four previous directives in a single legislative instrument. It is the result of revision of the acquis related to the consumer, which started in 2004 with the aim of simplifying and completing the existing regulatory framework relating to consumer protection. The current regulatory framework results in significant compliance costs for European companies that wish to operate across borders and have to comply with differing legislations. I believe the fragmentation of legal rules acts as a deterrent both to companies and consumers from buying or selling across borders.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report under discussion aims to achieve necessary balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of companies in the insurance market, while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity. Therefore I support the rapporteur's proposals that tend towards a kind of targeted harmonisation, that is to say harmonisation limited to specific aspects of certain contracts such as, in particular, information obligations or the right of withdrawal in remote or off-premises contracts, while managing to maintain a high level of protection for European consumers.</p>

At the same time, it seeks to protect and support companies, regardless of their size, which can provide goods and services to consumers in Europe without encountering unnecessary legal barriers. By bringing together four directives on this subject, we hope to harmonise the current rules in a more defined manner, avoiding the fragmentation of laws which is very often an obstacle for both consumers and businesses.

      <p sl="en">The approved report sweeps away the fragmentary nature of existing regulations in the area of consumer protection, which ends up discouraging consumers and businesses from getting involved in cross-border trade. Consumers in particular often complain that they cannot make full use of the advantages of the single market, especially in relation to trading over the Internet. In my opinion, the correct response to these complaints is an approved set of common definitions, such as the concept of a consumer, a seller or a distance agreement. Also beneficial is the creation of a list of basic information to be provided by the seller before any kind of consumer contract is concluded, and the unification of the deadline for withdrawing from a contract at 14 days in the case of distance or off-premises contracts, including the creation of a single form for withdrawal from a contract. Unfortunately, in the case of this report we have seen how the left has, at the last minute, failed to support the compromise agreed with the rapporteur, and we have therefore had to put it to the vote. However, that is no disaster in my opinion, and on the contrary it is perhaps an illustration of the fact that the European Parliament works as a political body in which an open and genuine ideological conflict between the European right and the left unfolds.

      <p sl="pt">In October 2008, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive aimed at bringing together in one text the acquis on consumer protection, which covers four directives on unfair contract terms, certain aspects of sales and guarantees on consumer goods, consumer protection in distance sales and consumer protection in contracts concluded away from business premises. It is worth noting that these directives, which have been subject to revision, provide for minimal harmonisation clauses, which has led many Member States to maintain or adopt stricter rules on consumer protection, creating a fragmented regulatory framework throughout the Community with consequences in terms of the internal market, particularly for businesses and consumers in cross-border transactions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that this legislative text, which was voted upon today, strengthens consumer protection while taking into account the characteristics of the sector, in which complete harmonisation may not always be feasible.

The objective is very ambitious: it means to create a complete reform of consumer legal protection which addresses the entire subject of contracts and which brings into play the 27 national laws that provide different levels of protection. About a year ago, Prof. Monti said in his report to President Barroso: ‘ … the legislator should find without delay an agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, in order to ensure a high level of protection for consumers in an integrated retail market’. I fully agree with Prof. Monti. The absence of common rules in various Member States has given way to fragmentation of legal frameworks which is harmful for both consumers and manufacturers and in fact prevents the realisation of a common market. At a time of crisis like the one we are living through globally, Europe cannot afford to let its manufacturers lag behind and its consumers be insufficiently protected. It is therefore a matter of urgency that we come to an equitable common denominator in order to harmonise laws throughout Europe. We must all make an effort to reach an agreement with the Council, even at first reading.</p>

However, the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection. Article 5, for example, will mean that a company will have to provide very extensive pre-contractual information even when goods are purchased in store. This will hardly benefit consumers, as they can assess the product directly in the shop. Article 22a places companies under obligation, in the case of distance contracts, to supply their goods to customers in any Member State. Such an obligation contradicts the freedom of contract and exposes small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to considerable legal and financial risks.

There are a few reasons why I abstained in the vote, namely that in my opinion inadequate sanctions are provided for, no right of withdrawal is planned in the case of Internet auctions and, above all, the definition of doorstep selling is very vague.</p>

      <p sl="it">I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Schwab as I believe that the report represents a fair balance between protecting consumers on the one hand, who must be protected from fraud and unorthodox behaviour by manufacturers and third parties, and, on the other, avoiding regulations that are too stringent for manufacturers, by imposing obligations which, given the size of their business and turnover, they sometimes cannot put up with. Take the case of a craftsman who, in theory, can work outside business premises: he cannot be subjected to the same requirements as a large multinational company which manages and concludes thousands of contracts every day. Harmonisation that is focused and balanced, taking into account the peculiarities of the European manufacturing base while preserving consumer protection, is therefore the way forward.</p>

The fragmentation of rules is, in fact, considered a deterrent for both consumers and businesses who buy or sell across borders.</p>
      <p sl="it">Given the situation regarding the consumer acquis , the approach in favour of complete harmonisation in this proposal is not practicable at present. Therefore, it is necessary to correct its scope by making a structural change. In line with the resolution of Parliament and with the statement made in the working document of the Committee for Internal Markets and Consumer Protection in 2009, a new approach based on full harmonisation is preferred, that is to say harmonisation limited to specific aspects of certain contracts while maintaining a high level of consumer protection.

      <p sl="de">I am pleased with today’s decision on consumer protection. We have taken an important decision for Europe’s citizens, enterprises and the single market. It is heartening that it was possible to find a sensible approach for a partial standardisation of the multitude of European systems of law. Nevertheless, from an Austrian viewpoint there are a few problematic points which now urgently need to be discussed and clarified in the trilogue negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission: (1) The ‘procurement element’ must be included in the text. Procurement element means, for example, that if someone asks a beautician to come to his or her house in order to utilise the beautician’s services (in other words the person procures the business connection him- or herself), the right of withdrawal should no longer apply. (2) We need to ensure that no additional burdens for SMEs arise, provided that adequate consumer protection is ensured. Ultimately, additional financial and administrative burdens on SMEs would be passed on to customers. (3) Chapters IV and V (liability and unfair terms) should be deleted, because even after lengthy negotiations it was not possible to achieve the desired full harmonisation. Deletion would avoid a standstill and open up the way for new possibilities in the trilogue negotiations. (4) With regard to the welcome rule on Internet scams, a few adjustments still need to be made in order to ensure a balance between consumer protection and the burdening of businesses.</p>

      <p sl="de">I voted in favour of the compromise package on consumer rights negotiated between the groups, because it was possible to introduce some improvements to the directive compared with the Commission’s proposal. It is important that the basis of the directive is once again minimum harmonisation and services like those in the health or social sphere are removed from the directive. There was also an improvement in the area of distance selling, where the withdrawal period for consumers has up to now been a week, but under the European Parliament’s amendments two weeks would now be provided for. Purchases at trade fairs are now also classed as direct selling. In Austria, a purchase at a trade fair has up to now been treated, from a legal point of view, in the same way as a purchase in a shop. However, some important points still need to be improved. The highest priority in this regard is Chapter V of the directive, with which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is completely dissatisfied. We must prevent the list of unfair contract terms from being exhaustive – the Member States should not be prevented from extended their level of consumer protection. Many consumers in Member States with a long tradition of consumer protection would otherwise find their protection worsening. I have therefore also voted for referral back to committee, so that these essential points can also be resolved and improved.</p>

The amendments should boost consumers’ confidence when making purchases in other countries and ensure the same conditions for companies, thus fully exploiting the potential of the common market. On the other hand, the new rules must be balanced in such a way that they do not become an intolerable burden for small and medium-sized enterprises. Consumer protection is very important. Only by taking levels of consumer protection seriously, will it be possible to achieve full harmonisation. It is also important for citizens to know their rights. This is a problem throughout Europe, but particularly in my own country. According to data from the Eurobarometer poll, initiated by the European Commission, the vast majority of Lithuanians would like to learn more about their rights as consumers. According to the poll, two-thirds of Lithuanians (66%) believe that the Lithuanian legal system does not provide adequate protection by issuing penalties to companies which deceived or defrauded them. The message is clear. We cannot ignore it. Statistics also demonstrated that people have little confidence in the government and EU information offices – less than 7% of Lithuanians trust these institutions which provide them with correct information and advice on consumer rights.

      <p sl="de">Despite financial crises, the EU has indulged, and continues to do so, in the creation of additional authorities – for every issue and every problem a new agency is set up. Between 2005 and 2009, the budget for the EU agencies more than doubled and the number of employees rose by 65%. The added value they provide is highly questionable, however. The results leave something to be desired and the monitoring of them is inadequate. On average, taxpayers have to pay EUR 579 million per year for the EU agencies. I am very much against the establishment of new agencies. It is unacceptable for taxpayers to finance the officials of the Member States with very cushy jobs in pointless agencies. I therefore voted against the report on establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency. The Commission has more than enough trained officials to take on this task.</p>

Japan has been struck by a natural disaster on a massive scale which also caused a major nuclear accident, the true scale of which has so far been impossible to assess and which will have consequences for people’s health and the environment for decades to come. The European Union immediately activated its Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate its humanitarian, technical and financial aid. This disaster should be seen as a starting point for thoroughly assessing and reconsidering issues surrounding the safety of nuclear energy. With nuclear energy there is not only the issue of the operation of power plants themselves, there is also the question of the storage of waste nuclear fuel that will last for centuries. During the earthquake in Japan, underground facilities for storing waste nuclear fuel were damaged, which would lead us to believe that the hitherto prevalent view that burial is the safest means of neutralising waste is not at all proven, and that waste storage facilities may become a great danger to people’s health and the environment. I believe that it is essential to begin active discussions within the EU and at international level to make it possible to ensure the highest standard of waste storage in nuclear power plants already in operation and to seriously consider the benefits of the planned nuclear power plants and assess possible dangers.</p>

Once the fire that continues to smoulder at Fukushima nuclear power plant has gone out, many questions will need to be answered – could certain disasters have been avoided, and what safety improvements should other nuclear power plants carry out, so that natural disasters do not cause nuclear accidents? All countries using nuclear power should check the safety of their nuclear power plants. Those planning to construct new power stations should examine more closely the dangers they pose. However, at present it is most important for the European Union to show solidarity with the ordinary people of Japan. The resolution on the situation in Japan is therefore crucial. We must provide all the necessary humanitarian, technical and financial support to help people survive now and to reconstruct affected regions in the future as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="it">The disastrous earthquake that struck Japan on 11 March cannot pass unnoticed in the eyes of the world; it must be our cue to reflect on the political and socio-economic aspects of the disastrous consequences of the tsunami. Like all my colleagues, in approving this motion for a resolution I express my deepest sympathy to the Japanese people who, with a great sense of civil responsibility, are reacting as best they can to the disaster. I hope and request that the EU will take action to provide humanitarian aid, through its own civil protection services, and propose suitable projects to solve the problem of nuclear contamination through a joint project with the Japanese authorities to try, as far as possible, to restore the situation to normal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">On 11 March, Japan and the Pacific region were hit by a devastating earthquake, followed by a tsunami which caused thousands of deaths and missing persons, along with considerable material damage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this resolution, which expresses solidarity with the victims of the earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear accident, and I hope that Parliament’s call for the EU and its Member States to extend all possible aid and support needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level to the regions affected, will be heeded with the utmost urgency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At a time when Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War II, following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country on 11 March, I would like to join the expression of complete solidarity with the Japanese people and Parliament's call for the EU and its Member States to extend to the affected regions all the help and aid needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level, as a matter of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The earthquake and the tsunami that struck Japan on 11 March have led to the deaths of many thousands of people (the current count exceeds 27 000 dead and missing), and have caused considerable material damage. Under these conditions, Japan must now deal with a nuclear accident of extreme seriousness. As Japan has not experienced such a crisis since the Second World War, I fully support the resolution of the European Parliament on the situation in that country. I also call upon the EU to provide Japan with all the humanitarian, technical and financial assistance possible, including medical supplies, mattresses, tents, food, experts and specialists in radioactivity and nuclear energy … I also wish to put on record my fullest solidarity with the Japanese people. I congratulate them on their mobilisation, their courage and their determination in the face of such a disaster. Moreover, given the gravity of the situation in the Fukushima power station, I call on the Japanese Government to demonstrate the fullest transparency and on the Member States of the EU to organise a broad public debate on energy, one that is not solely restricted to nuclear.</p>

      <p sl="en">I very much support this resolution that states: ‘1. Expresses its most complete solidarity with the Japanese people and government and presents its sincere condolences to the victims of this threefold disaster, bearing in mind that the human losses and material damage have not yet been fully assessed; welcomes the mobilisation, courage and determination of the Japanese people and of the authorities in response to this disaster; 2. Calls on the Union and its Member States, as a priority, to give Japan and the disaster regions all necessary humanitarian, technical and financial aid and support and welcomes the fact that the Union immediately activated its Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate its emergency aid;’.</p>

      <p sl="it">With today’s vote I wanted to express solidarity with the Japanese people and its government in the wake of the devastating earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear accident. Together with my colleagues, we have invited Member States to provide Japan and the affected regions with all necessary support, including humanitarian, technical and financial support, while praising the decision to activate the Civil Protection Mechanism immediately to coordinate emergency aid. The exemplary courage and determination shown by the Japanese people and authorities in addressing the situation should be an example for all, and one more reason for the EU not to abandon this country in the very delicate phase of its complete reconstruction.</p>

      <p sl="pt">On 11 March the Pacific region, and Japan in particular, was rocked by a devastating earthquake and tsunami. I believe that it is important to mention once again here that natural disasters are increasing in number and intensity, and it is therefore necessary to rethink pre- and post-crisis scenarios at a global level in order to anticipate and provide assistance to the countries affected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At the same time, the natural disaster also caused an extremely serious nuclear accident, which has affected the Fukushima nuclear plant in particular. This event has shown that it is crucial to think about safety conditions at European nuclear plants.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would therefore like to call for a discussion, preceded by a thorough analysis, on how to reduce the devastating effects of a nuclear accident on the regions and people where it occurs. I welcome the EU’s willingness to extend all humanitarian, technical and financial aid as a priority, along with the instant activation of the European civil protection mechanism. However, I believe that it is vital to grant this mechanism more logistic and planning resources so that it can become a real mechanism for the protection of the countries affected.</p>

      <p sl="fr">My thoughts go out to the victims’ families, to the wounded and to all the Japanese people who have been struck by this cataclysm. The courage and dignity of the Japanese people compels admiration and I am pleased that this House has demonstrated its support and its solidarity by means of this resolution. This is the greatest disaster that Japan has experienced since the Second World War, and the catastrophe at Fukushima has shocked us all and forces us to review our approach to nuclear energy. This issue has no bearing, however, despite what some may have us believe by means of a political salvage operation, on the opportunity to continue with the production of nuclear energy, an energy of the future that plays its part in the decarbonisation of our economy and that guarantees our energy independence. The drama of Fukushima requires us above all to strengthen our requirements in the area of nuclear safety. I support the proposals of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for a definition of common safety standards and for greater vigilance within and around nuclear power stations. In this matter, the expertise and performance of the French nuclear industry must serve as an example. From now on, the responsibility rests with the European Union, which must take strong measures to ensure that a nuclear disaster of this magnitude will never happen in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">The enormous damage caused by the recent earthquakes and tsunami in Japan will not be cleared up overnight. We must stand ready to provide Japan with concrete practical assistance, even after the media interest has died away.</p>
      <p sl="en">Solidarity is one of the fundamental pillars on which today’s Europe rests. It is right that, along with Member State governments and parliaments, the European Parliament too has given a clear signal to our friends in Japan, sorely afflicted as the country is, that we are with them and that they can rely on our help at any time.</p>
