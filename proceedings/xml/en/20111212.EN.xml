      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few remarks at the beginning of our part-session: I would like to draw your attention to the priority debate tomorrow. This will be the report by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, on the recent European Council summit. The longest possible time, or in other words nearly three hours, has been planned for the debate. I strongly encourage you to take part in this crucial debate for the European Union. This matter is vital for us.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">My second remark is that news has reached us about the hammering out of an agreement at the climate conference in Durban. Of course, it is not satisfactory, because it does not specify any details of what is to happen in the future. However, I wish to stress that the European Union and the European Parliament’s delegations have played a very important role, with 15 of our fellow Members attending, and this time it seems that the European Union’s delegation spoke with one voice at the Conference. This is very important.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">My next piece of information is that this year marks the60th anniversary of the signing of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. This document forms the foundation of our EU asylum regulations. It also defines the international understanding of the term ‘refugee’. The European Parliament, as you know, is actively working on and involved in matters related to refugees. We have also participated in the negotiations on the common European asylum system. We are calling for its full implementation in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to remind you, if I may, of the Shusha camp in Tunisia, housing refugees from Libya and citizens of almost all African countries. These are people who cannot return to their homeland. The European Union, and above all the Member States, should take a decision on this matter. The United States has agreed to accept 800 refugees, Norway 400, the European Union, at present – all the Member States together – 150. There are 3 800 refugees. They cannot return to their homeland and currently the Tunisian authorities are in charge of them. They live in the open desert in tents.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">My last piece of information is that I would like to mention an important anniversary. Tomorrow it will be 30 years since the imposition of martial law by the Communist authorities in Poland, trying to crush the Solidarity movement. Many people died defending their right to freedom of expression and to freedom. Many people were arrested and persecuted. If we think about what Europe looks like now, 30 years later, especially Central and Eastern Europe, we can see what a great success we have achieved together. Without the help of Western democracies, human rights and democracy in the Central and Eastern Europe countries could not have developed the way they have. This is also a lesson to us to provide the same kind of help to the North African countries, the countries to the east of the Union and the Western Balkans.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I still have the following pieces of news. One of them is very welcome, and so I shall deal with it straight away. In connection with the entry into force of Protocol 36 on transitional provisions concerning the composition of the European Parliament for the rest of the 2009-2014 parliamentary term, as of 1 December, or in other words for the past few days, Parliament has had 17 extra Members. We already have 17 new Members. The eighteenth Member, from the Netherlands, will join us in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">If I may, I would now like to read out the names of our 17 new Members, and I would ask them to stand up once their name is read – since they are with us in the Chamber – as we would like to welcome them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Can I remind this House that the recent report from the Commission ‘decriminalised’ the Romanian and Bulgarian workforce, so to say, by proving statistically that their contribution to both the EU’s and the destination countries’ GDP was – I repeat, statistically speaking – strictly positive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, time is of the essence regarding this matter, as the deadline for imposing or extending barriers against Romanian and Bulgarian workers is 31 December 2011. Consequently I am sure this House will wisely acknowledge the importance of this matter and show its support for it.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A7-0394/2011 by Carl Haglund, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, setting out a recommendation on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco setting out the fishing opportunities and financial compensation provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco (11226/2011 - C7-0201/2011 - 2011/0139 (NLE));</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the oral question to the Commission on the future Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial compensation provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco, by Carl Haglund on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and Carmen Fraga Estévez on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) (O-000319/2011 - B7-0671/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-028-000" speaker_id="96683" name="Carl Haglund" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will take the opportunity to present both issues at the same time – as you proposed. Allow me to start with the resolution that my dear colleague Carmen Fraga Estévez and I have drafted together. It concerns a resolution on the current arrangement with Morocco, something that has been debated several times in this House especially over the past year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy that we have come to a point in time where we have been able to agree among many groups on the content of this resolution. I know there are some alternative resolutions, but the main message remains: that Parliament wants to see a better agreement with Morocco in the future, and I am happy that, together, we have been able to identify that the current arrangements with Morocco are desirable. However, they need to be economically and ecologically far more sustainable than they are today. So I am happy with the resolution. I am sure that there will be a broad majority in support of the resolution. My colleague Carmen Fraga Estévez will probably get back on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning my report on the same issue: we have been dealing with this topic in the Committee on Fisheries for a long period of time and – in light of the resolution, which clearly states that the current arrangements are not very good – I would like to explain why we need to vote against this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I say ‘against’, I think it is important to note at this point in time that my initial recommendation for the Committee on Fisheries was not to consent to this agreement. The reasons are very well outlined in the brief resolution. A fisheries partnership agreement – and I say a ‘partnership’ agreement – should be viewed as a fisheries ‘partnership’ agreement, something which benefits both parties. Unfortunately, as we can see from the very good ex-post evaluation report, we have an agreement in front of us that is economically far from sustainable. The evaluation report states very clearly that, of all the fisheries partnership agreements, this places the heaviest burden on European taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Practically speaking, the return on the agreement is negative. Many agreements have a positive return with about a 40% positive return, while this one has a negative return with only 65 cents return on every euro invested. This is a very bad deal for European taxpayers. On top of this, of course, there are the ecological aspects and I actually find them far more troubling.</p>
      <p sl="en">The basic principle of fisheries partnership agreements is that we fish the surplus; in other words fish which is there to be fished and not over-fished. Therefore it is disturbing to note that out of the eleven fish stocks covered by the agreement – we have only been able to assess nine of the eleven as two of them lack data – nine fish stocks are over-fished. In other words, we are not fishing the surplus; we are fishing more than the surplus, which is ecologically unsustainable and goes against the basic principle behind these EU agreements which we have laid out in the common fisheries policy. This is also a reason why we need change.</p>
      <p sl="en">With these things explained, I think it is quite clear that we need to pass the resolution to show our Commissioner – who is sitting right there – that she has our backing for a new agreement, but at the same time a better agreement which takes into account all the problems outlined in the ex-post evaluation report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to take the opportunity to say that from Parliament’s point of view, working on this dossier has not been the easiest because of timing and because of the new arrangement where Parliament is obliged to consent to these agreements. This is an arrangement which came with the Lisbon Treaty; it is both an obligation and a responsibility for us as Members of this House to actually examine these agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">In light of what I have done and in light of what the two committees who took the opportunity to give an opinion on this agreement have done, it is clear that we should not accept the current arrangements. That is why we should vote ‘no’. I can tell you that the Committee on Development and the Committee on Budgets both gave opinions on my report; both recommended for us not to consent to the current arrangements. I think that is a very strong signal from both the Committee on Development and the Committee on Budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Committee on Fisheries we had a very tight vote which ended up in favour of the report, and I am sure we will have a tight vote also on Wednesday when we vote on the actual issue. But I urge all colleagues to take the responsibility which the Lisbon Treaty gives us, and examine the current arrangements very thoroughly and at the same time note the fact that we are calling for a future agreement with the Moroccans. This should not be seen as a hostile move towards our partners; it should rather be seen as us taking ourselves seriously on a very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their good cooperation on this issue. I am aware that all of us do not share the same approach, but I want to thank colleagues for a constructive dialogue so far and I am sure we can handle this issue in a constructive manner despite certain differences. I will end my speech here.</p>

    <intervention id="1-029-000" speaker_id="1993" name="Carmen Fraga Estévez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the fact that we are currently within the extension period of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Morocco is simply because the Commission did not fulfil its obligation at the time by requesting a negotiating mandate or reporting the agreement well in advance if it was not being fulfilled. This is nothing to do with the fishing fleet: they are neither responsible nor should they have to suffer the consequences. Therefore, I strongly advocate resolving this situation by ratifying it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not agree with those who oppose it, whether it is for the political issues in the Sahara, or the negative results in the fishing evaluation report. In that regard, I would like to refer back to 2006 and my report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco when this Chamber was very firm both in terms of the benefits that the Saharan people should receive, as well as denouncing a disastrous negotiation, the loopholes in which have led to the poor results.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would stress, however, that I do not think any of these issues are going to be resolved by sending the fishing fleet home. On the contrary, I think we should look at the future of our fishing relationship with Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, Commissioner, we are again in the situation where there are less than three months of the extension period remaining and there is still no negotiating mandate. The sector is again plunged into uncertainty, but this time it has taken the initiative and acted responsibly alongside the Moroccan fishing sector and, with the agreement of their respective administrations, together they have drawn up an action plan for the future, which was delivered to you in Brussels last week.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the reason why Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I, on behalf of my group, have tabled an oral question and a motion for a resolution which look to the future, a future based on new foundations which try to make up for the mistakes that were made and which have the approval of all interested parties.</p>
      <p sl="es">I simply request that the Commission is …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity to share with you my assessment referring to the current situation and my views on the future of our fisheries agreement with Morocco. Let me start first with the interim protocol. You are now going to decide whether or not this protocol can be concluded. The lead committee has adopted a positive recommendation, but I know that many of you are not convinced, so let me explain our position.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, this one-year protocol – an interim protocol – was agreed with Morocco in February this year, just before the previous one expired. I am convinced that this decision was right. I believe even now that we have done the right thing. Why? Because the interim protocol provided us with the time to address those legal and political issues which are related to fishing in the waters of the Western Sahara.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have pressed Morocco to provide us with reliable information that the local population benefits from the exploitation of these waters, as is required by international law. These efforts have given some potentially positive results. For the first time, the current protocol includes a formal requirement for Morocco to report on benefits and their geographic distribution, and in so doing it sets an important precedent for any future protocol.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to economic and environmental issues, the mandate to extend the previous protocol did not leave us much room for manoeuvre during the last round of negotiations. In other words, we really did not have the possibility to go for a better agreement referring to economic and environmental issues. However, it is clear that any future negotiations will have to result in a better deal. After all, this interim protocol made it possible for fishing activities to continue without interruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that a lot of you are not convinced about this, but I would just like to remind you that this is really important for some hundreds of European vessels fishing there, most of which are small-scale vessels.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the basis of a decision taken by the Council in July, the protocol is now being applied provisionally. Indeed, there is less than three months left before it expires at the end of February next year. So I can understand that your rapporteur, Mr Haglund, and Ms Fraga Estévez and others are not happy that Parliament is able to express itself only now. But this is not our fault. We have done everything possible to speed things up. In any event I am glad that Parliament has proceeded to this plenary vote without further delay. I can assure you that the outcome is of great importance to all of us. In any case, we are going to respect Parliament’s vote. That is something I would like to make absolutely clear. Your vote next Wednesday will be respected by us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also assure you that we are taking very seriously the comments made in Mr Haglund’s report, as well as the issues he raises and the issues raised in your motion for a resolution arrived at today. So in the case of any agreement, we have to significantly improve the text with regard to environmental, economic and legal/political aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say here a few words on recent developments in Morocco and on the state of relations between the European Union and Morocco, against which your decision today should also be judged. The winds of change that have affected the Southern Mediterranean and some countries beyond have touched Morocco too. So what is the Commission’s assessment of this? The Commission assessment is that, in Morocco, the authorities have launched a significant process of reform with the elaboration of a new constitution, increasing democratic accountability and respect for human rights as well as the successful holding of parliamentary elections which have brought new forces to power. The European Union, at all levels, has welcomed these changes. This House has also called for the EU to support the process of democratic reform in Morocco. That is the framework we have to bear in mind when making our decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said in the Committee on Fisheries last month, the Commission is in the process of preparing a proposal to the Council for a new negotiating mandate. At first we thought of waiting for your vote on Wednesday, but then we understood that it would be too late for our preparations and too late for you to vote on the substance. That is why we have already worked towards taking this initiative, in order to be ready in case this House gives us a positive signal to go forward on Wednesday. So we have done the preparations. If you give your consent to the interim protocol, we are ready to go forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">What are the main parameters of this better deal with Morocco that we should be aiming at? First, on economic profitability. We are definitely seeking value for money. It is imperative that any new protocol should ensure a better utilisation of available fishing possibilities as well as an overall financial envelope that clearly reflects market value, as other committees of this House are asking for. Second, on environmental sustainability. This means that we will be defining fishing possibilities based on best available scientific advice and also that we will be targeting only the surplus. Third, on international legality. With regard to the issue of the waters off Western Sahara, we will fully respect international law. There are a number of options on how to achieve this. We are working on all of them. If we were to follow the option of including the waters off Western Sahara, then we would need to demonstrate, through a strict and rigorous reporting mechanism, that there are economic benefits for the regions and local populations concerned. This would become a condition in the new protocol.</p>
      <p sl="en">On all these issues, we will draw on the conclusions from the implementation of the present protocol as well as from the debates in this House. The Committee on Fisheries last month recommended that Parliament consent to the conclusion of the protocol. If that approach is followed by this House, then we will very soon be ready to move ahead towards a better protocol to this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the middle of the Sahara, Morocco has built a 2 700-kilometre-long wall which is the longest wall in the world after the Great Wall of China and is guarded by 120 000 soldiers and millions of landmines. It will also become the world’s longest conveyor belt, transporting phosphate resources out of the territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Morocco took the country of Western Sahara in 1975 using napalm and phosphorus bombs. That was an attack on a people abandoned by their Spanish colonisers and was a contravention of international law. The fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco, including the waters of the Western Sahara, is in fact illegal. This has been established by the legal services of this House in a recent opinion, which overrules the previous legal opinion of the Commission, which was written before it was possible to establish two things – firstly, if the EU was actually fishing in Western Sahara and, secondly, whether or not the financial payment was to the benefit of Western Sahara and if the fishing had the consent of the people of that territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are now two answers to those questions – 74% of the EU fleet capacity does operate in the waters of Western Sahara, and the people of this region have not been consulted on the matter. I have seen the answers to these questions, which Morocco gave to the Commission one year ago. They make it one hundred per cent clear that Morocco is not going to recognise there is even such a thing as Western Sahara. They do not even mention Western Sahara.</p>
      <p sl="en">This makes one other thing very clear – namely that Morocco does not need this agreement. Morocco has a domestic fleet that is bigger than that of Spain. They have the national fisheries policy objective of tripling fisheries’ contribution to GNP, doubling domestic employment and increasing domestic consumption of fish. In 1999, Morocco terminated the EU fisheries agreement for those very reasons, and because of the EU over-fishing that is now also taking place. It is extremely clear that Morocco only wants to keep the fisheries agreement with the EU for one reason: to legitimise Morocco’s illegal occupation of Western Sahara by making the EU an accomplice in this criminal act.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be shameful to this House and to the entire European Union if we, as a proponent of human rights and defenders of international justice and democracy, gave our consent to this shameful agreement.</p>

    <intervention id="1-033-000" speaker_id="96750" name="François Alfonsi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Committee on Budgets wished Parliament to withhold its consent to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco. I should point out that in practice, withholding our consent would have no effect, since the agreement was concluded in February 2011, and therefore expires in one month’s time. The Committee on Budgets also rejected a proposal to remove the budget commitments linked to this agreement for the coming year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nonetheless, by expressing this opinion against the proposal, the Committee on Budgets wanted to send a warning signal. This agreement entails damaging environmental consequences, since it is well known that these fishing grounds are overfished. It also entails problems in terms of the legality of the expenditure, in that the Moroccan Government still refuses to budge on the decolonisation of Western Sahara, and three quarters of the fishing ground in question borders the Sahrawi coast.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If Parliament were to follow the Committee on Budgets’ example and vote against consenting to this protocol, it would send a strong message to the Commission concerning the negotiation of future agreements. At a time when the whole southern Mediterranean rim is waking up to democracy, it would also send a strong message to the Moroccan Government, encouraging it to begin the process of democratic reform, especially with respect to the people of Western Sahara.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will deal first with the subject of the provisional protocol.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As shadow rapporteur for my group, I would like to convey a message to the rapporteur: I hope that when the time comes for the report on the funding of maritime affairs and fisheries, on which I am the rapporteur and Mr Haglund a shadow rapporteur, we will be able to have more regular discussions than we have had on this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to repeat what I have said, and remind him that I am, and always have been, available to discuss all the subjects that we have already worked on and will, I hope, work on together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fisheries agreement currently in force between the EU and Morocco is a one-year extension, as already mentioned, of the previous agreement that the Commission proposed. As you know, this agreement will end on 27 February next; in other words in two months’ time, as Mr Alfonsi has just said. It allows ten EU Member States to fish in Moroccan waters, and whether we like it or not, it benefits local inhabitants. The aid which the EU pays to the Moroccan industry supports fisheries policy development throughout the whole of that country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I call upon my fellow Members to vote in favour of this agreement, as it is mutually beneficial. Our consent will allow negotiations to begin on a new fisheries agreement, with new criteria attached. Withholding our consent, on the other hand, would send a very negative signal to the whole region, at this time of democratic reform. Morocco is a vital partner for the European Union. EU support should consist of more than just declarations: we make plenty of those here. It should also consist of agreements, and practical action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The resolution on the future agreement by our group and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe sends a strong signal to the Commission to negotiate an agreement that is profitable and ecologically viable, and will allow the EU to make good use of fishing opportunities. However, as you know, we must first vote in favour of the provisional agreement.</p>

The whole of Parliament is talking about the agreement; the debate has been a matter of controversy within all the groups in recent days and weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a fisheries agreement that needs careful analysis. What is the result of such analysis? Those of us who are members of the Committee on Fisheries are agreed that this agreement is not ecologically sustainable, because it contributes to overfishing. I regret to say that this has rather been forgotten in the debate so far, but nonetheless it is a key point. In view of the catastrophic state of the world’s seas, the European Union should not be allowed to overfish its own waters, much less waters belonging to third countries. This protocol also has no economic merit. There is no win-win situation for us. In addition, there remains the Western Sahara question. I am sure we are agreed that the agreement must be in accordance with international law.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current protocol on which we are going to vote has all these shortcomings. For this reason, it is not possible to vote in favour of it. We are now being consoled with the idea that it will all change in the future. I hope that is so, and that our resolution will help the Council and the Commission to get things right in the negotiations with Morocco. The only convincing reason for voting in favour is that the protocol is about to expire and the Commission has asked us not to bring about a break in it, because that would make the new negotiations more difficult. It assures us that all our demands will be incorporated into the new protocol. Not only is that something I am expecting, but indeed I am relying on it being the case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Commissioner must excuse us if some of us feel outrage at the existing agreement. You only have to look at the evaluation study to recognise its faults. The study makes absolutely clear that this is the least successful of all the bilateral fisheries agreements agreed by the European Union. It is one under which our taxpayers are paying EUR 36 million a year – for what? Very little. The fish we land does not even end up in the European Union: it goes down to Africa or gets sold on to the Asian market. The ship-owners – there are 80 ships, more or less, on a constant basis there – are paying just EUR 2 million. That is a subsidy of extraordinary proportions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not surprisingly, when we look at the issue of sustainability and we recognise that these fishermen are fishing in waters which are described as ‘fully-exploited’ or ‘over-exploited’, there are questions here about the whole sustainability aspect.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think we can have confidence that the Commissioner will do her very best to negotiate a new arrangement which meets the criteria of sustainability and the social requirements referred to in the declaration. She can also have a smile on her face, as she was not responsible for negotiating the appalling arrangement we have in place at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, evidently I oppose not only the extension of the current agreement, but also a new agreement, and the reasons why have already been mentioned. There are three types: legal, economic and ecological.</p>
      <p sl="es">Legally speaking, it is a simple issue. Morocco negotiates using resources that are not theirs and two courses of action can be taken from here: either the Saharan territorial waters are excluded from the negotiations, which has not occurred up to now, or international law is respected, demanding that this agreement respects the benefits for the local population, but also their wishes, Commissioner, the wishes of the local population to which no one has yet referred.</p>
      <p sl="es">From an economic standpoint, it is also clear that the agreement is a shambles because under no circumstances does it lead to a benefit, and it is also economic profligacy, even more so during conditions like those we are currently experiencing. The ecological issue is even more serious, however.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are faced with a situation where the agreements should respect a maxim: exploitation of surplus stocks only. When it comes to Moroccan waters, we find overfishing is already taking place by local fishing, and we can add to this the contribution we Europeans are making.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are three elements for voting against the extension and a new agreement, therefore, which are legal, economic and ecological. Furthermore, for once, I think it would be good for this Parliament not to bow to the pressure and blackmail of the Moroccan Government, to act responsibly accordingly and, in particular, guarantee its credibility.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, by proposing to extend this agreement the Commission is caught in the trap of its own incoherence and contradictions. The Commission ordered and paid for an ex post evaluation by an external consultancy after the agreement had been in place for four years.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The evaluation was clearly negative, both in economic terms, from the point of view of its utility to the Member States’ fleets, and in ecological terms, from the point of view of the perilous state of conservation of various fish stocks, not to mention any positive impact on the Moroccan fishing sector, which is, as in other cases, much reduced or zero.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Faced with the result of this evaluation, the Commission has come here to say that the report did not necessarily represent the Commission’s position, but it did not, as it should have done, counter the analysis therein with any objective data that might have contradicted it. However, the most serious issue raised by this agreement, which justified our opposition to it in 2005 and likewise justifies our opposition today, is that the agreement is illegal under international law.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The agreement with Morocco covers the exploitation of a natural resource over which Morocco has no jurisdiction under international law. According to the International Court of Justice, Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara has never been recognised from 1975 to the present day. By including waters off Western Sahara, this agreement contravenes all the resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations on this issue, particularly the 2009 resolution on economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the non-self-governing territories.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is noteworthy that the legitimate representatives of the Sahrawi people were never given a say on this agreement: they were completely ignored, along with their will. This is an obligation derived, contrary to what you said, Commissioner, this is an obligation derived from international law, and let us not simply be satisfied with Morocco’s assertions that the people of Western Sahara are benefiting from this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should say that we do not disagree in principle with fishing agreements with third countries. On the contrary, we have supported several of them, despite their many limitations and shortcomings. However, these agreements should be a free expression of the sovereign will of the peoples and countries involved, and should not provide cover for the pillage of natural resources as is happening here. The European Union is, unfortunately, a party to this pillage. Our opinion is that the only solution to this situation is to exclude the waters of Western Sahara from this agreement and to set up a process of dialogue with the legitimate representatives of the Sahrawi people …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Morocco has occupied Western Sahara since the 1970s. If this fisheries deal goes ahead, the EU will be in breach of international law. We know it, the UN knows it, and even Parliament’s legal services know it. The financial contribution to Morocco will be EUR 36 million every year for EU boats to plunder overfished stocks. The Commission has provided no assurances that the Western Saharan people will benefit from this deal, and I have no doubt that the money will be hoovered up by the Moroccan authorities. Despite all this, the Commission does not care and wants its deal. UK boats that operate in the area go to great lengths to make sure local people benefit, so it would be a shame for them to be disrupted.</p>
      <p sl="en">This all demonstrates the failure of EU control over UK fisheries and trade. I am appalled that the Liberal Democrat political group tried to cancel this public debate and submitted a resolution that urges the Commission to close the deal as quickly as possible.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the external dimension of the common fisheries policy (CFP), in general, and the fisheries partnership agreements (FPAs) with third countries, in particular, constitute a crucial aspect of the CFP. The EU-Morocco FPA is one of the most important for the southern European fleet, arising at a political juncture when it is important not to close any doors.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Indeed, the FPAs enable the Union fleet to access external fisheries traditionally frequented by the European Union and indispensable for obtaining major fisheries products which help to guarantee Europe’s food supply. At the same time, they also play a major role in the economies and social development of third countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the European Union’s action at international level must also be consistent with the CFP’s principles and objectives, namely the sustainability and preservation of marine ecosystems. In this context, the new sustainable fishing agreement between the European Union and Morocco should be geared towards sustainable management of fisheries resources through a transparency clause ensuring that the exploitation of fish stocks by Union vessels in third country waters is limited to the resources that these countries cannot, or do not wish to, catch themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, the new EU-Morocco agreement should have a credible scientific basis and an effective method of monitoring and supervising its implementation, safeguarding the interests of the Union fleet, of marine ecosystems and of local populations, whom the agreement should also benefit. In this respect, and in general terms, I am bound to regret that the European Union’s high standards of behaviour, which propose respect for local populations and the safeguarding of their fisheries resources, are not observed by other fleets that sometimes fish in the same waters, which will, in fact, happen illegally if the European fleet withdraws.</p>

      <p sl="it">Well, we must consider this phase closed. If the Commission – or, rather, the Commissioner, who did not draw up this agreement – asks us to consent to the agreement, we must put this phase behind us and concentrate in particular on the new agreement and on what will happen in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="it">As someone who has upheld the Sahrawi cause for many years, I am not sure if it is a good idea not to have any further relations with Morocco. We cannot replace the agreement, the lack of which would not help us resolve the conflict, which has been going on for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p sl="it">What Ms Lövin said was music to my ears. I wholeheartedly agree with her, although I do not think the fisheries agreement is the way to solve the problem. We certainly will not find a solution when the UN has had a mission in place for 30 years that has been incapable of resolving all the humanitarian issues involved.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should therefore say ‘yes’ to the resolution and ‘yes’ to extending this agreement, because the resolution should encourage the Commission and spur it on to negotiate hard, both to ensure that the new agreement truly responds to these requirements, and to ensure that it is a sign that the Union’s foreign policy must heed.

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, yesterday I returned from Tindouf, where I saw just how much the population of the Western Sahara benefits from our policies and from all who claim to make agreements in the interests of this population. This agreement must be rejected and I strongly urge you to do so, for moral, political and ethical reasons and for reasons of international law.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This agreement is not a normal fisheries agreement. This is an agreement that will entrap international law and justice. This is an agreement that offends the dignity of this nation of the Western Sahara, which is already suffering under Moroccan occupation.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to vote on an agreement which is highly unusual in that it relates, in part, to what the United Nations has ruled is illegally occupied territory. This means that we are not only talking about Morocco’s natural resources, which are the subject of this agreement, but about the national resources of a people that does not have the right – or that has not had the right – to self-determination.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a Portuguese Member, I am bound to remember the case of Timor-Leste, when the European Union repeatedly censured Australia for being in negotiations with Indonesia over the resources of an illegally occupied country. No Member who defended the Timorese cause in this House can, with a clear conscience, vote for such an agreement, which would make the European Union the beneficiary of resources that do not belong to it any more than they do to the state with which it is negotiating, and which would make us accomplices in a robbery for which there has, to date, been no compensation and which has not, to date, been put right.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that something is wrong when we are debating an extension today, in the month of December, which ends in scarcely two months.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nonetheless, we are discussing an agreement that is important to the European Union and to Spain in particular, an agreement that cannot be used as an excuse for diverse claims that are not strictly fishing based, and one which I agree should be extended despite the fact that many aspects of the agreement are unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have always defended agreements with third countries, and even more so with neighbouring countries and those of such importance as the Kingdom of Morocco. It is precisely for that reason that I hope that the extension will be ratified and that a new agreement is negotiated, which is balanced, fair and beneficial for all signatories and allows our fleet to continue working.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am confident that this agreement will be reached, and that, as well as being economically viable and guaranteeing the sustainability and conservation of resources, it will also have positive consequences for the signatories from a social and working perspective.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I also robustly defend that the agreements must be respected and comprehensively fulfilled, and for that reason and to be consistent, I questioned the agreement with Morocco for the agricultural sector and I emphatically support the agreement for the fishing sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">We do not have anything against Morocco, quite the opposite, but this does not detract from the fact that we demand that the agreements are respected as is deserved by the citizens we represent.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we as the Socialist Group consider that it is important for this extension to be ratified, as it will be the foundation for us to reach a better agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">This agreement, which ends on 27 February 2012 (only scarcely three months remain, as stated by the Commissioner), has been negatively assessed from an economic standpoint. However, the importance to the 11 countries of the European Union has not been assessed, which I mention due to the question that has just been posed. They do benefit from this agreement, as do the 800 European Union workers who are in employment because of the agreement, as well as the fact that thousands of jobs have been created in Morocco, and also in the Sahara.</p>
      <p sl="es">When it comes to sustainability as an important component, reference has been made to the ex post report. For the next agreement, we request scientific data that specifies the fishing capacity, given that according to the aforementioned ex post report, the European Union only fishes 10% of the total that is fished. According to the report, the impact is negligible.</p>
      <p sl="es">A new agreement is needed, Commissioner, a new improved agreement, a new agreement under the Treaty of Lisbon, as you said, a new agreement with this additional specification of a detailed report about how to apply the agreement and which population benefits, and about the compliance of international law. The agreement should also benefit both parties, however.</p>
      <p sl="es">The overall architecture: it is necessary for the European Union to prioritise the association agreement between the European Union and Morocco; a social and economic aspect to international agreements; solidarity and the strategic sector. Europe cannot be left behind on the international stage. The ratification of this extension and the next agreement are both important.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think that I must clarify some points.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline that the Commission is here to defend the common European interest. Our common fisheries policy is about the common European interest, so I cannot accept arguments that, in the case of this agreement, only this or that Member State fishes there. There will be other agreements whereby other Member States will fish there. Also, we are all European citizens and all of us consume fish, which is a very important part of our diet. We are the world’s leading consumers of fish and we need to have good relations with all the nations across the Mediterranean and other areas. So, please, while I understand that we are going through a very difficult time, a very difficult situation, this separatist narrative is not really fruitful.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point I should clarify is that the Commission does indeed care about the rights of the people. We are not saying that we do not care about the rights of the people of Western Sahara. That is why we have gone for an interim protocol; that is why we have pressed the Moroccan Government to give us data on how the local population will benefit from this agreement or other agreements. That is why we have come to you with an interim protocol. That is why we are trying to negotiate a new agreement, under all the circumstances of which you are already aware.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are trying to ensure, I can assure you, is that any new agreement including the Western Sahara will be introduced only on condition that we are sure that the local population will benefit from it. We do care, but please be aware that it is not easy to solve the international problem through this agreement, and the Commission cannot accept that idea.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be clear on this point. I am here to explain everything to you and to say very clearly that the Commission is going to respect your vote. I would like to have a clear answer: do you want a new agreement? I can promise you that I will do my best to obtain a better agreement. A better agreement means one that is economically profitable, environmentally friendly, and in accordance with international law. It is not as easy as it would appear from some speeches here to interpret international law.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, please, I would like to have a clear answer on this. I can see that there are different opinions. I can see that some people are against the fisheries agreements in general; others are against this agreement in any event. Some others think that we need a better agreement; yes, but after all we need a clear line.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I can say to finish, as I have used up a lot of time, is that the Commission is already preparing a negotiating mandate for the next agreement. I can assure you that, if we negotiate another agreement, it will be better than the previous one, but we need the consent of Parliament to do so. Let us be honest and face facts: if Parliament says ‘no’ to the agreement, then we can have no agreement. I would like a clear line on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Referring to the past, I agree with you that the agreements we had were not economically profitable or environmentally friendly, and that is why we are going to change them. That is why we are reforming the common fisheries policy, and I hope you are going to support us in order to get this reform through the Council and its decision-making process. We need this agreement, however. That is my opinion. We need to have good agreements, but we do need agreements, as otherwise we are going to be isolated from all these areas.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me say to the Commissioner that I am very happy, and I think all of us are very happy, that you are striving to have a good agreement in the future. There is no doubt, based on the debate, that this is something that we all want. I cannot, however, at all agree with the conclusion that we need to vote in favour of a terrible agreement that almost everyone seems to think is bad, just to give you a good agreement in the future. That reasoning does not work.</p>

We are not voting on a future protocol now; we are voting on the current protocol and the current protocol is bad. I will vote in favour of a good protocol next year if you deliver one. I promise.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been mention that this protocol delivers EU jobs. Let me tell you that every EU job created by this protocol is subsidised by EUR 45 000. Is that good economic policy and good spending of taxpayers’ money? No. Let me also tell you that only 15% of the sectoral support from Morocco has been used. Fifteen per cent, which means that 85% was unused. Keep that in mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very happy about the debate, which focuses on the future. I also want to do that. Our partnership with Morocco is important; we have the neighbourhood policy through which it has been concluded. I think everyone has stated very clearly – despite a few voices – that they want a good agreement in the future. That is what I have been telling the Moroccans all the time. I am happy the Commissioner is saying that. Let us focus on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, before that, we need to take a clear stance, live up to our responsibilities and vote on my report – which is not on a future protocol, it is on the current protocol.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Western Sahara, I am happy that the Commissioner is looking for different arrangements, because it is clear that there are so many colleagues in this House that find the current arrangements very problematic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also say that there are many countries in the Council who are critical: the Austrians, the Swedes, and lately the Bundestag, the Dutch, the Finns, the Cypriots, etc. are critical. So we also have a very tough debate with the Council, which is not unanimous on this.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Commission wishes to extend the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which has been found to be ecologically damaging and which, at over EUR 36 million annually, is not only one of the most expensive agreements, but also one which benefits neither the European taxpayer nor the domestic population. Yet some people still say that EU policy is not dictated by the big lobbyists! An extension to the fisheries agreement cannot be justified – particularly since the two parties to the agreement have drawn it up so as to include the fish-rich waters of occupied Western Sahara, which are now threatened with overfishing. In view of the economic crisis it is all the more important that the EU stops squandering taxpayers’ money in this way, which robs small fishermen of their livelihoods while benefitting maritime big business. If the EU looks the other way then we will shortly be cultivating a new generation of Somali-style pirates in Western Sahara. The agreement contravenes both international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The EU, which likes to cloak itself in the mantle of democracy, human rights and international law, would be well advised to pay heed to such matters itself – whether we are talking about CIA operations, Kosovo or Western Sahara. The EU’s legalised plundering of the seas off occupied Western Sahara, which contravenes international law, must come to an end.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco is an emotional issue in the European Parliament. However, I would appeal to my fellow Members to engage in an objective debate on this subject. I agree that the most controversial issue is the vague territorial specifications. However, these should not dominate the debate or be misused to block the agreement. I think that as long as the UN has not formally resolved the issue of the status of Western Sahara, the scope of the agreement should be kept as it is.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like briefly to remind you that the agreement complies with international law and does not violate any of its provisions. Moreover, it is cost-effective and environmentally responsible. It generates profits and benefits for both the 11 EU Member States and the people of Morocco; approximately 800 jobs for European fishermen, support for thousands of jobs in the processing and coastal industries in Morocco, and also, as the European Commission points out, in Western Sahara. The agreement is politically and economically necessary, and a rejection of the proposal to extend it, against the backdrop of the Arab Spring, would send out a very negative message to the Moroccan authorities which have already started the process of democratisation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management as regards the multiannual financial framework, to address additional financing needs of the ITER project</p>
      <p sl="unknown">[COM(2011)0226 – C7-0108/2011 – 2011/2080(ACI) ](A7-0433/2011).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a majority of this House wants to give ITER, the international nuclear fusion project, a chance. This international project is led by the European Union, and Council has granted it EUR 6.5 billion up to 2020 as the EU’s contribution – representing 45% of the total funding. This EUR 6.5 billion includes additional financing needs of EUR 1.3 billion, and that is what we are concerned with now. I must state that I hope that ITER will now continue with improved project management. At the same time, however, this House insists that other priorities in research and innovation are not sacrificed as a result of the additional financing needs of ITER.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over the past year we have not succeeded in finding a solution, in reaching a compromise on the additional financing needs. We have quite rightly separated the 2012 budget procedure from the resolution of the ITER question. In the second round the trialogue reached a conclusion, which was firstly to take EUR 100 million from ITER’s budget lines in the 2012 budget and secondly to revise the ceiling for Heading 1a upward by a total of EUR 840 million in 2012 and 2013, and in return to decrease Headings 2 and 5 by the same amount. That is relatively uncontroversial.</p>
      <p sl="de">After significant struggles we then agreed on the following wording: that a third tranche of EUR 360 million should come from transfers to be made in the 2013 budget within the ceilings of the financial framework. The text of the trialogue conclusions states that this allows all the options open to us under the Financial Regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement, without requiring a revision.</p>
      <p sl="de">So far, so good. The Committee on Budgets approved the trialogue conclusions by a large majority. Unfortunately, I have to report that at yesterday’s decision by the Permanent Representatives Committee, six Member States – Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom – then added that they regret that it is not specified where the funding for 2013 is to come from. Let me quote in English:</p>
      <p sl="de">‘With regard to the draft budget 2013, the Commission is therefore asked to determine the required appropriations for ITER without using the negative reserve, the flexibility instrument or margins’.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a highly provocative statement. It is not a clever statement; it is politically stupid and brash. It amounts to nothing less than a pre-emptive blocking minority in the Council which breaks and destroys both the spirit and the substance of the compromise reached right at the outset. We had not banked on that. We will have to talk about it again immediately after the debate in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would recommend to the groups in this House that we vote in favour of the report on the revision – that we stick to the agreement. At the same time, however, I would say that we are only in a position to guarantee the EUR 360 million for 2013 if, as regards the draft budget for 2013, the Commission acts strictly on the basis of the trialogue conclusions and does not eagerly go along with this blocking minority in the Council. We can only guarantee the EUR 360 million if the Council is willing and able to act on the basis of the trialogue conclusions, making full use of the provisions laid down in the Financial Regulation and in the IIA. Parliament needs to nail its colours to the mast. We must put an end once and for all to the way in which some parts of Council treat Parliament and are not prepared to conduct substantive and budgetary discussions. That is why Parliament must make a stand tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, dear Members of Parliament, after more than eighteen months of discussions, the Commission welcomes the political agreement finally reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the financing of the experimental reactor ITER in the years 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the second piece of good news in the last few weeks as far as the EU budget is concerned. On 1 December, Parliament adopted the 2012 budget, including part of the additional amount required by ITER. This week Parliament is asked to agree on almost a billion euro increase in the expenditure ceiling of Heading 1a, under which ITER is financed. The proposed revision of the current multiannual financial framework will provide the fresh money necessary to cover most of the additional financing needs of ITER in 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact that Parliament and Council are able to take such important decisions, despite the current difficulties in national public finances, is a sign that Europe can and does work. So let us focus on this, let us move forward even in difficult times to promote projects that are expected to have a significant impact for the future of next generations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that we can stick to the agreement found on the financing of ITER, which takes into account the concerns of both arms of the budgetary authority and strikes the right balance between fresh money and funds available within the existing expenditure ceilings. The decision to revise the current multiannual financial framework provides certainty to the funding of ITER and enhances the credibility of the Union vis-à-vis its international partners participating in the ITER project.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to say that the Commission will take on board the statement made by the rapporteur. We have to reflect on that and I think we can come up with a fruitful proposal relating to the upcoming 2013 financial prospects of this project.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like also to say that we understand the concerns of some Member States, but we have to stick to this agreement now and see what will happen in the future. In this regard, I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Böge, Mr Lamassoure as Chair of the Committee on Budgets, as well as the Polish Presidency for all their efforts to achieve an acceptable compromise. Let us stick to this compromise in the name of the EU’s general interest and in the spirit of loyal interinstitutional cooperation. I am confident that this House will give the deserved support to the resolution proposed by your rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="it">The issue of not touching the funds allocated to the Seventh Framework Programme and to research, which was put forward very strongly in committee, met with an agreement that I think safeguards everyone’s interests. At the same time, this approach means that the European Union does not lose trust and credibility and will also remain an international partner, making the most of the investment that has already been made.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control have both paid great attention to ensuring that in future the ITER project will be well managed, its finances will be monitored, its funding will be properly evaluated and the financial increases will be kept within reasonable bounds. However, I believe it is a major problem, in the case of a project established jointly by the Member States, which the Member States have decided on in the Council, when the Council opts in the same breath to increase research funding and extend the financing available for research and this results in cuts in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, in order to make more money available for ITER. This was not what was originally decided on by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Agreement was reached in the trialogue and my admiration goes to the rapporteur who showed the patience of a saint in attempting to ensure that progress was made in the negotiations. I would like to know how we in Europe are supposed to improve our global reputation when we demonstrate that we are lacking in unity and unable to agree in the context of a large international project. Making a note of this kind in the minutes about an amount of EUR 360 million, which retrospectively calls into question a joint compromise reached in the trialogue, is a simply disgraceful way of presenting ourselves to the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should see ITER as a really important project and Parliament is prepared to do this. However, in this case the Member States need to make some sensible proposals on financing the decision that they have reached, without once again interfering with the field of research.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement on providing the ITER project with additional resources for the next two years was an extremely tough decision. I wish to congratulate both the rapporteur Mr Böge and the Polish Presidency for helping us reach this agreement which, I will repeat, was very difficult and involved making a few compromises.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I know that various views are held in Parliament about this project and its future. However, this is one of the major, promising scientific projects which may produce a scientific breakthrough and, more specifically, in the energy sector to which the European Union has already made a commitment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We must be frank about this: such a large scientific project cannot be funded without the European Union making a firm, long-term financial commitment. We reached a fair, acceptable consensus on a few points: the need for an additional EUR 1 300 million; funding of EUR 940 million in 2012. However, the EUR 360 million in funds for next year, 2013, remains to be clarified.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I wish to say in no uncertain terms that we will stick to what we have agreed with the Council under the terms agreed in the joint text. I do not accept what is stated in a unilateral declaration from six Member States, that these funds be provided only by redistributing funds for promoting competitiveness. I want to say to the Commission now that, if it proposes such a budget for 2013, it will be a mistake and it will not be accepted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I want to start out by thanking our excellent rapporteur, who has worked persistently on this complicated dossier. The outcome is as good as it can be at this stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say very clearly also, in the light of what has been said already concerning some voices within the Council, that, if there are those in the Council who find this agreement reached in the trialogue some weeks back unsatisfactory, there are also many in Parliament who find this solution very unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am one of those who feel that this is the best solution that could be found, but it does not make the outcome in any way satisfactory, because we are still going to start redeploying money from Heading 1a, and mainly from the framework programme for research to the ITER project. This is something that Parliament has stated very clearly is not its desire, both in its report on the ITER issue itself, only two part-sessions ago, and also in the Committee on Budgets, in my opinion on the Euratom Treaty, which addressed the issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">So this should be taken into account by the Council. A compromise is a compromise and this is a fair deal reached in a difficult economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Polish Presidency has done a good job, together with our rapporteur and others, in negotiating to find an agreement that is reasonable. We should stick to it. There are no other options. If this deal does not hold, then we are going to have a very hard time finding a deal that will be feasible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also, in the light of the fact that the framework programme for research is a programme that is implemented to almost 100%, with huge requests for funding under Heading 1a, and this is also the sector of the budget that is actually driving growth in Europe, we should use all the money available under Heading la for the initial priorities foreseen in the initial MFF, where ITER was not foreseen. This is why we cannot redeploy more than this deal foresees and why we should stick to it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in this House have two reasons for voting against additional funding for the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. In our view, it is a high-risk technology, because radioactive tritium is needed to provide the heat for the fusion process. Particularly in the year following the Fukushima disaster, the European Union should be doing everything in its power to phase out this type of high-risk technology, rather than developing it further.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we do not claim to be able to assess whether the project will be a success. This is an open question, but there are, of course, legitimate doubts about whether it will actually be as successful as the majority of its supporters here are always saying. The problem primarily concerns the additional financing. We have just heard that in the 2012 budget EUR 100 million will be taken away from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, in other words, from other important investments in research. For 2013, the funding is once again completely unresolved. I can only agree with Mr Böge that the Council has behaved in a completely unfair way and this makes the fundamental attitude of six Member States clear. They are only interested in redistributing the European budget and are obviously no longer willing to admit how important the Europe 2020 strategy is for the European Union and no longer prepared to put their money on the table and invest in new competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="de">In particular now, following the outcome of the conference in Durban, it must be obvious that we need to invest in low-carbon technologies which will enable us to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions in a few years, which focus on renewable energy and which are genuinely able to take the European economy forward in this respect. However, that is exactly what is not being done with the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. Instead, urgently needed money is being taken from the area of new competitiveness and spent on the reactor, despite the fact that no one knows whether this project will ever be successful. From a green perspective, this is a case of setting the wrong priorities and, therefore, we will vote against it.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, today is the umpteenth time that the ITER project has come up for discussion. Let it be clear that the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is not opposed to nuclear research. Moreover, the ITER project is useful for international business and Dutch companies are amongst those who benefit from it; which is a good thing. It would be very difficult for any single Member State to fund a project such as ITER on its own and that is why we are, in principle, in favour of the global financing of this project.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, what does worry us is the continuing cost overrun for ITER. As much as an additional EUR 1.3 billion over the next two years. For this reason, the current financial framework needs to be reviewed – a process which has been described here as a ‘revision’. The PVV believes this to be a rather peculiar state of affairs, because a unanimous vote in the Council is required before this revision can be approved. We have had a great deal of debate about the specific conditions for additional funding for the ITER project, but the issue of whether or not such significant additional funding will be accepted by the Netherlands, one of the EU’s Member States, remains, in our view, very much open to question.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As far as the PVV is concerned, ITER demands significant sums of money. However, the sheer magnitude of the amount, without the prospect of any firm agreement that future ITER funding will stay within limits, is the reason why we will be voting against the Böge report and against the rising costs of ITER. Please note, Mr Böge, that the Council has the final say in this. Which is just as well!</p>

It is supposed that we all want the same thing, which is the development of the European Union and, in this case, the pursuit of such a long term and important project as the funding of an experimental fusion reactor that can completely change the energy outlook in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am now speaking to you as the rapporteur of the European Parliament report on the next financial perspectives. In this report, we already made a request that large projects, such as ITER, keep their accounting within the structure of the next financial perspectives to avoid the problems we are currently facing with ITER. Under the European Parliament proposal, this debate and these unilateral declarations made by the Council would not have occurred.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can easily understand the financial restrictions that are placed on the Member States, how can that not be the case if we are part of the Member States? However, we are part of the European institutions, and accordingly, the agreements are there to be fulfilled. We have just come out of a trialogue in which it was evident that the funding for ITER in 2013 cannot occur solely through the redeployment of the category corresponding to research and development, but rather the remaining budgetary tools provided by the Interinstitutional Agreement will have to be used.</p>
      <p sl="es">We don't prejudge what they are, nor what they should be, nor how much. What we want is to keep the debate open and any kind of unilateral declaration, such as has been made by the Council, goes completely against what Parliament has done for the 2012 budget, that is, being reasonable, open and, in particular, open to dialogue with the other institutions.</p>

Parliament has always expressed clear support for a knowledge-based economy and the Innovation Union, and this solution definitely follows that path. It is very important to us that a project which simultaneously promotes a knowledge-based economy, a new type of energy economy and a carbon-reducing solution is finally put in its proper place. We consider it crucial that we maintain this course under the next budgetary framework as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Knowledge must take priority over austerity. Austerity implemented at all costs will never lead the European Union to success by itself.

      <p sl="es">We have shown our support for this project in the European Parliament on many occasions; we have always been available to both the Council and the Commission for finding the best solutions for this funding issue that has been raised, and there have been several misunderstandings with the Council, but it appears we have finally reached an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">With a lot of will and, in particular, engineered accounting, during the 2012 budgetary negotiations and the trialogue on 1 December, we have found a way to fund that extra EUR 1 300 million so that ITER can continue.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it appears that six countries want to turn the screw even further and have signed a unilateral declaration for the EUR 360 million for 2013 to be funded through cutbacks in other programmes.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, they wanted cutbacks in the Seventh Framework Programme, which was blocked by Parliament as it was clearly connected with the Europe 2020 strategy. Do you recall that strategy? It appears that sometimes, when it comes to money, the existence of this strategy is forgotten. Now, again, they want to propose cutbacks, or rather demand them. Where are these cutbacks to be made? Does it not matter from which programme? It appears that the Council does not mind.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is the case that their strategy is not even to allocate an additional euro: that is the only strategy that the Council knows how to defend. The only strategy we are going to defend is that no programmes can be cut back to fund ITER.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find it hard to celebrate the fact that we have reached an agreement with the Council on financing the extra cost of ITER.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The point of these discussions (which muddied the negotiations on the budget) was not simply to find a solution for ITER. The main issue was, in fact, to deal with the underfunding of the European Union budget, which has become a structural problem to the extent that we are now in a position of questioning whether or not the EU has the capacity to honour its international commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ITER project is yet another illustration of the fact that the EU budget is not adequate to meet either the EU’s ambitions or our strategies. The reason that ITER has become, and will continue to be, one of the greatest sources of ongoing tension between Parliament and the Council is that Member States are demanding ever more from the European Union on the project, but are not willing to bear the financial consequences. By tinkering around the edges, and proposing short term solutions for funding these increasingly costly major projects, Member States are jeopardising the Union’s capacity, from 2013 onwards, to afford the tasks for which it is responsible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the period 2014 to 2020, by deciding to remove the ITER and GMES projects from the next financial framework, even though they were both established as research and development projects by a majority vote, the Commission is admitting that it is actually unable to guarantee that the financial resources will be there to meet our responsibilities. This is a serious admission of failure and incapacity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union does not have the wherewithal to abide by its international commitments, and yet research, innovation and energy are among the major aims of the 2020 strategy, along with employment, sustainable development and growth. Pitting these different priorities against each other is not the way to …</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the proposal for an amendment of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2006 to address the additional financing needs of the ITER project is in line with the Council decision concerning the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities (2012-2013), on which we voted in the last part-session.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the trialogue meeting, Parliament, the Commission and Council agreed to bear the additional cost of EUR 1 300 million for the ITER project in the period 2012-2013 as follows: EUR 100 million already included in the 2012 budget, EUR 360 million by way of a commitment appropriation for 2013, and an increase in the ceilings for the commitment appropriations under Heading 1a of EUR 840 million.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Therefore, on the basis of the knowledge base provided by the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy, the ITER experimental nuclear fusion reactor which is being built in Cadarache in France could form the basis for the future generation of experimental fusion reactors, and Europe could become a world leader in the construction of such reactors.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Böge on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for his attempts over almost two years to reach a compromise on financing ITER. Even in the light of the Council’s irrational actions, the proposal that he has submitted to us for tomorrow still represents an attempt to find a solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there are two things I would like to point out. One is that I myself took part in the trialogue negotiations. The Council’s arguments in the trialogue in response to the point made by Parliament that the budget line for ITER was not adequate amounted to a desperate plea for a compromise on this subject in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research. We specifically stated in the trialogue that the surplus costs could not be paid from the first pillar. Therefore, the Council fell into this problem with its eyes open.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a consequence, for us this can only mean one thing. Horizon 2020 needs its own budget line for the major European research projects, including ITER, Galileo and also Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). We are now calling on the Commission not just to play a role in the dispute with the Council, but also to take independent action for the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to raise two points that I feel are important. When we talk about generating electricity using this fusion, rather than fission reactor, we are talking about starting in 2100. Therefore, it is not really the most important priority at present.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, people have been talking about keeping the budget under control, and I completely agree. The only problem is that in 2006, the budget was EUR 5 billion, whereas in 2011 it is EUR 15 billion: in other words, three times higher. On top of this, because of Fukushima the Japanese are now saying they will not be able to meet their commitments in two years’ time. This means that ITER will be delayed by another two years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A third factor, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, is that this is the first time that a facility like ITER, which entails certain risks, primarily of disruption – and I would invite you to read the studies that have been written on the subject – has not been insured.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why will the Indians, the Chinese and the Russians not insure it? It is because they do not want to increase the ITER budget any further. We are therefore setting ourselves on a collision course, and it would be better to stop now, rather than pour billions into a project that supposedly will be ready by 2100. For this reason, it is time we put an end to ITER.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Commission has asked us to revise the Interinstitutional Agreement as regards the Multiannual Financial Framework, in order to provide additional commitment appropriations of EUR 1.3 billion from the EU budget for the ITER project in 2012-2013. According to the documents submitted, this involves the budget-neutral adjustment of a transfer of funds between individual EU budget headings in the 2012-2013 period. I do not wish to cast doubt on the ITER project or its contribution to the development of knowledge and innovation, but the transfer of such a huge sum of money indicates either poor project planning on the part of senior managers or a superficial job by Commission officials in drafting the relevant budgetary frameworks of the Union. It might be possible to accept such a transfer of funds if justified by exceptional circumstances. It must not become a frequently-applied routine procedure, however, undermining the budgetary stability of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, a few sessions ago we debated that the ‘Food for Free’ programme would not receive any funding in 2013. The resources which we are preparing to give now to the ITER project can fund this very programme on which tens of millions of pensioners and other socially deprived Europeans depend for the next five years.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The ITER project is indeed important. However, I wish to emphasise a point made by the Commissioner that this project is experimental. This means that we are currently pouring into it billions and billions of euros which may produce absolutely no result in the long run, providing no benefit at all from this project. This is why I think that this new proposal is causing an imbalance in the EU’s social and industrial activities, which is wrong and must be prevented.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to underline again that the Commission welcomes the compromise reached after very difficult discussions. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work, because this was really something very difficult to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an experimental scientific project, but we need to finance it since it is a major project and a major scientific challenge with great prospects. It is also a commitment – an international commitment by the European Union, and we have to show that we can fulfil our commitments and, in spite of the difficult circumstances, the difficult financial situation, we cannot postpone the very important scientific commitments we have already made.</p>
      <p sl="en">Referring to the objections, we have heard about the commitment of the Japanese Government, referring to the Fukushima accident. Well, of course, the Fukushima accident may have had an influence on their position, but what I would like to make absolutely clear is that in mid-November the Japanese Government came to the ITER Council and committed themselves to fulfilling their obligations. So your argument about the Japanese Government is groundless.</p>
      <p sl="en">On nuclear liability, which is a great problem and which we understand is a legal problem that is very difficult to solve and very complex, as you have underlined, the ITER organisation and the governments around the table are trying to find a solution. We have to seek a positive way forward, and since we have reached an agreement we have to support it.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last remark, on the COREPER meeting today. I think that we have to stick to the fact that the compromise was adopted there, despite the different options and different opinions and the statement by some of the Member States. What I can say on behalf of the Commission is that the Commission is sticking to its right of initiative and will come forward next year with a good proposal to Parliament and the Council on the 2013 funding for this project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to pick up straight away on what Ms Damanaki said at the end of her speech. Her wording was diplomatic and cautious, but it concerned the commitment to the results of the trialogue. That is exactly what we expect from the Commission, because anyone who does not use their right of initiative correctly under the terms of the agreement will lose their privileges. Therefore, I am assuming that the Commission will apply its right of initiative on the basis of the spirit and the content of the trialogue results. I also assume that certain Member States will not attempt to exert pressure at that point, which could potentially result in the entire structure being destroyed again, because we have only been able to agree on this over three stages and this is the way that we have negotiated it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the debate in the Committee on Budgets, we also attempted to look in detail at the management problems mentioned by Mr Paška. We are hoping that this situation will improve in future. It is true that there have been omissions and errors in this area. I would also like to warn the Commission and the Council that before they make international promises like the one made by the Council to the international research community on ITER involving EUR 6.5 billion, which includes the EUR 1.3 billion additional funding, they should speak to Parliament, which is part of the budgetary authority. I would like to remind them that Ms Ferrero-Waldner always took a very positive and constructive approach to consulting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets on foreign policy matters. As a result, it was possible to resolve some of the areas of conflict in advance during the course of a sensible discussion.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Madam Vice-President, I would like to touch on what Mr Ehler mentioned concerning the long-term perspective. We need to make it clear that if we want large projects, whether it is ITER or Galileo, or whatever it might be, we must understand what funding is available for specific periods, so that we do not constantly have to deal with the problem of additional financing. These projects also belong in the European budget, but they must have appropriate funding, so that we can avoid the chaos of the last two years, which always seems to accompany essential large-scale projects of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against that background, I would like to ask my fellow Members to vote in favour of the report tomorrow, with the relevant comments that we will submit, but also to make it clear how we plan to resolve the problem of the forthcoming EUR 360 million in the 2013 budget.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is indisputable that we need to support the ITER project, given the international commitments we have made, the importance of ITER for future energy sustainability and its contribution to European technological development. However, it is also indisputable that a project of this kind involves significant technological risks which are unfortunately not uncommon with scientific and technological projects. There are increased planning and management risks with such a highly complex project. In the recent past, inadequate risk management has led to the failure of the project’s budget. We need to put right past mistakes; we need to learn from them; we need to put in place measures to prevent them reoccurring in future. While we accept and understand recourse to funds left over from agriculture and administration, it is regrettable that, to secure the rest of the funding needed for the ITER project, there is an insistence on using funding for the Seventh Programme Framework, since this is a vital tool of budgetary policy for achieving the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy: economic growth, job creation and competitiveness. We need to keep the Union’s strategic priorities clear. It is deplorable that contextual constraints and the established budgetary status quo mean that these are constantly succumbing to attempts to put measures for relaunching European competitiveness beyond reach.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In order to overcome the increasingly intense energy crisis, Europe needs to secure the conditions of sustainable long-term energy supply. Nuclear fusion could provide a sustainable solution for energy problems at both European and global level. The process does not generate any greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive wastes, and could therefore become a permanent large-scale basic energy source that ensures sustainable development. ITER demonstrates and perfects the key technologies that are required for the development of fusion as a safe and environmentally sound energy source, with regard to which Europe has been at the forefront of research for the past 50 years. We are all aware that its construction represents an extraordinary challenge, not only from a financial, but also from a technical standpoint. The EU cannot ignore the matter of political prestige in this regard either. In the upcoming period implementation will require commitments of an additional EUR 1 300 million, out of which EUR 100 million have already been included in the 2012 budget. Together with the Council and the Commission, the European Parliament must elaborate a proposal on ensuring the balance as soon as possible. I believe that ITER will bring about the revolutionary breakthrough it promises, which could provide a key solution to our energy problems in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="de">While in conventional nuclear power stations energy is generated by nuclear fission, ITER is aimed at generating energy from nuclear fusion. This is the crucial difference from current nuclear power. Nuclear fission gives rise to long-term radiation and highly toxic substances that represent an enduring danger to man and the environment. In contrast, the residual products from nuclear fusion are far less radioactive. ITER could therefore pave the way for a sustainable source of energy, even if its use for power generation is still a long way off. ITER should therefore be given sufficient resources. Europe must stick to its guns and promote research with potential for the future. However, we need greater transparency and better cost estimates: exceeding the original budget by more than 300% is not acceptable. Moreover, continual increases in funding must not become the norm.</p>

      <p sl="cs">We sometime take decisions that may not bear fruit for the people of the EU for decades. Often, the position we take will influence life only for our children, whilst we will sometimes not even be able to confirm whether we have voted for a sensible project. The ITER project is one of these. The prospect of success with nuclear fusion is nonetheless very alluring, and to be honest, we do not have many options for the situation when our energy sources run out. I am therefore convinced of the need to support the ITER project. Yes, it is expensive, and yes, the outcome is not 100% certain, but there is a chance here. Humanity will not develop and move on without courage decisions. We should therefore finance programmes as ambitious as the nuclear fusion reactor. I am pleased that we are finally approaching a solution to all of the problems, and I hope that one will be found, despite the latest apparent obstructions from some Member States. Europe will then not prove an unreliable bedfellow for our partners, who include the US, Russia, Japan, India and other countries. I do not know whether the claim is entirely correct that the current costs for ITER represent just 3% of US military spending last year. It shows, however, that this is not such an absurd use of money for us as some people are trying to make out.</p>

      <p sl="es">I say that from the heart as, since I entered this Parliament, I have been loyal in my commitment to the victims in defence of their rights, and one of the basic rights of any victim is to be suitably protected. My commitment extends to all citizens, as we are all potential victims of crime and we have the need to be able to live in a world and a European area of freedom, justice and security.</p>
      <p sl="es">With your votes in favour, we will be legislating to make life easier for the victims, who will feel equally protected in any country of the European Union going forward, without the need to initiate a new legal procedure with every move. In summary, we will make it easier for the victims to move around and we will limit their aggressors’ movements, which I consider to be a big step forward that I am delighted to have been able to make as the rapporteur for this report. The time is already upon us to stop allowing crime to cross borders, placing our lives at risk. We have the right and duty to protect ourselves, and this tool will serve that purpose.</p>
      <p sl="es">Despite the difficulties and the path we have taken during these two years of negotiations, which has not always been smooth, I want to thank the Polish Presidency today for having skilfully driven the negotiations. I also want to thank the Commission which, thanks to the vision of Ms Reding on presenting the legislative package relative to the victims and an additional regulation in civil law, has finally managed to dispel the Council’s doubts about the convenience of supporting the European protection order, along with opening the door to more wide-ranging legislation for the rights of the victims of crime and their support, on which I am working with a great deal of hope.</p>
      <p sl="es">I want to thank my co-rapporteur, Ms Romero, and also the Secretariat.</p>
      <p sl="es">When we return to our countries and people ask us ‘What do you do over there in Europe?’, given that they view our work as so distant and incomprehensible, this time I will be able to tell them that we have at least created an instrument, which we have ratified in this parliamentary session, which will protect so many people that suffer violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">I offer this future law for the many women killed through male violence, the many innocent people that suffer human trafficking without the possibility of escaping from their aggressors, the many defenceless children, the victims of terrorism that live with their terror, those that run from organised crime, and the many that don’t know where to go for fear of being pursued. We have taken a big step today towards the defence and protection of those that are most in need.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, Member of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, before us today is the conclusion of one stage and the start of another with the Directive for the European protection order for the victims of violence. I also want to thank the Polish Presidency and all those that have given us their support to allow this to finally see the light of day.</p>
      <p sl="es">We were aware of the difficulty when the Spanish Presidency, alongside another eleven Member States, presented the initiative in January 2010. It has taken us two years. We knew that violence against women, in particular, as well as against the weak, is violence that is still considered to be taboo, one for which we don’t know the official figures for Europe and, therefore, it was difficult to demonstrate the need and urgency with no idea of the information, crime and its prevention.</p>
      <p sl="es">The same thing occurred with the Directive for the trafficking of women, for paedophilia. There are no official figures: information exists that governments refuse to release, but no one doubts that human trafficking and paedophilia exist.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, a request was made at the same time to the Commission and the Council for the creation of an Observatory that could form part of the European Institute for Gender Equality or the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. At present, we have nothing more than a survey, the results of which won’t be known until 2013. Ms Reding, it is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="es">We don’t have official data, but if our information is that 25% of women in Europe suffer violence, we are talking about a serious problem; if we talk about 2 500 women that have been killed, we are talking about a serious problem. Can we know how many women file a report in Europe? How many have access to a protection order? How many are killed? Can we know how many human beings, how many children are the victims of violence in the terror that occurs in the household?</p>
      <p sl="es">It is so difficult to convince the Member States, but at least we have this Directive here today. We will all ratify it after a long process, during which a lot of resistance has been overcome. If we were in the commercial rather than the civil and criminal domain, the solutions would have been swift, without a doubt, but it is significant that it is the first directive created along the lines of preventative and restorative justice, and which is mainly aimed at women who are victims of violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thousands of European women have placed a lot of hope in this Directive: the women’s associations that have fought for it and those that suffer harassment and abuse, and they expect a great deal from us. It is a directive that gives victims the protection to move around freely, to avoid the ordeal of double victimisation, double procedures and double interrogations. There will finally be no borders when it comes to protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are now at the onset of another stage. We hope the Member States quickly transpose it. However, equally as important as the transposition, is the monitoring obliged by the Directive, the assessment of how it is applied, so that we know the reach of this first stage of this Directive. With this, we are simply starting the struggle against violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is now necessary for women to file reports in Europe, Commissioner, to lose their fear, to defend their dignity, so that they can become citizens. Not even the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European Union covers this torture, this killing in the private domain; this possibility is not included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The possibility of torture by state institutions is included, but not by someone who receives affection. Furthermore, this is what is terrible about these killings that occur in the darkest hours of the household.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is, therefore, the real message we are delivering: that abuse does not go unpunished, that crimes could be avoided. We will have figures on the aggressors and thousands of women will be able to breathe easily.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, protecting victims, wherever they find themselves across the Union, is – and must remain – a crucial element of our action, because exercising one’s freedom of movement and residence should not result in a loss of that protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">If improving procedural rights is crucial to developing a fair justice system, it is equally important to improve the rights of victims. As we raise those standards, we have to embark on balancing: on one side the rights of the accused and, on the other side, the rights of the victims in the administration of justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why the Commission has always supported the objectives of this proposal and why we have completed this Member State initiative by legislation allowing victims to benefit from the speediest means available for civil law protection measures as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to thank both rapporteurs, Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Romero López, for their determination and flexibility and for being so helpful in finding a good solution in this dossier. I would like to stress that the contribution from the European Parliament was also very valuable in raising the general level of ambition for this proposal. That was essential.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ensuring that no gaps remain in the protection of victims is equally important. That is why the legislation on a Civil European Protection Order (EPO) should be discussed and negotiated as a priority. Protection for women when they travel and go abroad is either covered under criminal law or under civil law for administrative reasons, depending on the system of the Member State. It is important to have both so that no woman will be left behind.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know this is a top priority here in this House. I discussed it last week with the incoming Danish Presidency to ensure that it will also be a priority for them. I really hope that at the beginning of next year we can add to the criminal EPO the civil EPO, in order to have this needless distinction removed. You are absolutely right that this will be very important for all the victims because it will be a signal to show them that Europe cares for them, that they are not left behind and that this awful crime, which often takes place in hiding, will come out into the open. That is also why I very much look forward to our fruitful cooperation on my proposal for a horizontal directive on victims’ rights, which will complete what we have now started to do on the EPO.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning data, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur that we do not have the necessary data in order to have precise figures – as precise as possible – because very often it is a family affair that is hidden in the household. That is why I have asked the Vilnius Institute to gather and collect data on gender-based violence. The Vilnius Institute is working on this. I will come back to Parliament as soon as there are results.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, some 8 000 Romanians benefited last year, as victims, from protection orders in Spain. These people are protected only in Spain, but should also benefit from protection when travelling to Romania or other Member States. According to the statistics, approximately 15% of Europeans are victims of crime, and the physical, emotional and financial consequences for victims and their families cannot be measured and recorded in terms of statistics. In Europe, the number of protection orders is estimated at 100 000, but they are valid only in the Member State which issued them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I thank the rapporteur Teresa Jiménez for the dedication she has shown in her efforts and for her commitment to the protection of victims.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also thank the Council for its legislative initiative and the European Commission for its legislative proposals complementing this directive with a view to recognising the protection measures issued under civil and administrative law.</p>
      <p sl="ro">All victims must be treated with respect and dignity and must receive protection, along with their right to freedom of movement within the Union, as a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, one of the fundamental rights that the European Union must guarantee for its citizens and residents is real freedom of movement under safe conditions throughout the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the moment this is not guaranteed for those people – most, but not all of whom are women – who have obtained protection orders in their own countries, often with great difficulty, after being persecuted, stalked or repeatedly threatened even with being killed by someone they know, often a spouse, as Ms Reding mentioned, or an ex-husband or a boyfriend, or in any case someone they know. Such people are in fact no longer protected when they travel to another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament and the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, are seeking to fill this legislative gap by means of this directive. I would like to point out that we have applied the codecision procedure for the first time, at the initiative of the Spanish Presidency together with another 12 Member States, including Italy, and with strong support from the Polish Presidency, whom I would like to thank.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the first legal instrument offering effective prevention and protection for actual or potential victims of crimes against the person or crimes of a moral nature across the European Union. It may be executed by either the civil or the criminal authorities of a country with measures that are the same as or equivalent to those taken in the issuing country.</p>
      <p sl="it">As the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to highlight the excellent cooperation that arose with the two rapporteurs and the invaluable contribution made by Ezio Perillo of Parliament’s Directorate for Legislative Affairs, who is today at the Court in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also want to say how pleased I am with the key points of our proposal: the expansion of protection to cover physical and psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty and sexual integrity; the right to information; the guarantees that the perpetrator of threats will also be informed of the consequences of breaching the European Protection Order; and the obligation for Member States to draw up comparable statistics.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, I also expect Parliament to adopt a position on the Victims package that Ms Reding has announced, so as to make this focus on victim protection truly horizontal.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a long journey. One only has to think back to the debate we had on this important subject, already a year ago now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to take the opportunity of my allocated time to praise the admirable work done by our two co-rapporteurs on this very important subject, matched by their admirable determination. As other Members have said, it will bear fruit tomorrow in the agreement. We are nearly at the end of the journey, after all the obstacles, disputes and very detailed legal discussions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are two things I would like to say: this is, of course, an important day for all the victims in Europe, and I support everything that has already been said on this. They can sometimes, quite unjustly, become forgotten victims, since we talk far more often about the rights of the accused than about victims’ rights. It is therefore a great day for victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, it is also a major step forward for the European Union, as not only have we been innovative in our procedure, with the two committees constantly liaising and discussing the matter with the Commissioner, but we have also created a legal instrument. This means that free movement within the European Union will be given wider scope and will be expressed more, thanks to this very valuable legal instrument, which speaks out loud and clear today as proof of, and an almost logical, natural legal progression in the process of greater European integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The journey may have been long, but today we stand together as witnesses to, and participants in, a great step forward in cooperation on criminal justice and prevention. To ensure that this prevention is also effective, and that in practice we have to use this legal instrument as little as possible outside national borders, after the agreement has been made tomorrow we will need to do a considerable amount of work on information, publicity and awareness-raising. This should be directed not only at potential victims, but also at all the authorities that will be called upon to implement this instrument.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our next step, as you said Commissioner (you will think we are never satisfied), will be to start looking tomorrow at a law on civil protection.</p>

      <p sl="es">It hasn’t been easy to reach this point: it has been far too difficult. However, I first want to applaud the initiative of the Spanish Presidency in starting the process, then the joint work carried out by Ms Jiménez-Becerril and Ms Romero, from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, showing that the coordination under Rule 51 is successful, which I hope is also the case for the package relative to the victims. Finally, I should like to applaud not only the work before us, but also the challenge of showing that this is a step forward, but, as Ms Romero stated, it is simply a step forward: by no means is it the final one. Many more remain, as there is no point in the victims suffering today and having to pay even more to have the right to be recognised throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, firstly, I would naturally like to thank the rapporteurs and other colleagues who contributed towards the creation of this hugely important Directive.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The protection of victims must not be limited to state borders, as victims often move in order to escape violence. In our common area without internal boundaries, it is therefore essential to have the possibility of also using protection measures in another Member State, and without having to commence new legal proceedings after moving in order to have the protection measures provided. I fully support the aim of this Directive, and I welcome the fact that several fundamental amendments were made under the co-decision procedure, and that the European Conservatives and Reformists Group can now support this final form. The changes I have in mind relate mainly to the area of the scope of the European Protection Order and also the legal basis for issuing a European Protection Order. I welcome the fact that the wording ensures a sufficient level of flexibility for cooperation between Member States, while securing protection measures for victims of all crimes.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am delighted that, thanks to this Directive, we can provide protection to the victims of all crimes, without imposing an obligation to amend national Member State systems, and that this Directive takes account of the different legal traditions of the individual Member States. It would be more than a pity if this important issue, and I mean by that the pan-European protection of all victims of crime, was undermined by further unnecessary harmonisation within the EU.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I am very pleased to see the commitment of the various EU institutions to this issue. Thanks to broad political and institutional efforts across the board, we have succeeded in producing an excellent directive in a constructive manner. I would like to thank everyone involved for the work they have done.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Within the framework of a European protection order, victims who are granted protection in a Member State of the EU will now be able to obtain equivalent protection if they move to another Member State. This is important. The protection covers victims of gender-related violence, harassment, abduction, persecution or attempted murder, for example. I believe that this directive brings us a step closer to a safer Europe for all citizens, but particularly for women, who constitute the large majority of the victims, and here I am talking about men’s violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The directive is assumed to apply only to protection measures taken in connection with a crime, but in the various legal systems of the Member States a person can receive similar types of protection with other measures, too. It is important to say that a victim of crime is guaranteed comparable protection. From the point of view of equality, the European protection order exists primarily to deal with the symptoms of gender-related violence.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In my opinion, the European protection order is one of several steps for dealing with and combating the fundamental causes of men’s violence against women. In order to take further steps, we now need an overarching EU strategy on men’s violence against women, a strategy that will then make it easier to find practical solutions for dealing with these abhorrent gender-related crimes of violence.</p>

We live in times where the European Union is continuously attempting to impair the sovereignty of nations. In these difficult times it is therefore very pleasing to see topics such as the European protection order come up as well. However, I would like to remind everyone that the coin always has two sides, and this, too, is a double-edged sword. We can of course use it for good causes, such as in the case of victims of crimes of usury, or prostitution for that matter. However, we should not only discuss malicious male chauvinists, but also situations where women might abuse this possibility in certain domestic conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I therefore ask everyone to let us consider how we could prevent the possibility of abuse by regulatory means. After all, the institution of family is sacred and inviolable. The integrity and unity of the family stands above all else, but protection must of course be ensured. A the same time I am most pleased that one of my fellow Members mentioned the protection of children … Let me state that the protection of children and the proper punishment of paedophiles, even by the harshest means, is very important.

At the same time I also commend the Commission on turning this Spanish initiative into an implementable proposal. I believe that today’s debate marks another important step towards the protection of victims. It is true that we cannot predict how many European citizens this measure will affect and the lives of how many victims or potential victims it will make more liveable, but it still carries within it an important message, a clear commitment by the European Parliament and the European institutions to protect the rights of victims. As mentioned by the Commissioner, the first part of the victim protection package, a directive, will be approved in the near future, followed by a regulation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The message is clear: our institutions take the side of the victims, rejecting any form of violence, while respecting the human rights of the accused in court proceedings. It is important that we prevent perpetrators from being able to pursue their victims across countries by making use of their right of free movement within the EU. Furthermore, we consider it important that we adopt the proposal in such a manner that the application of the protection order in another country entails the least possible administrative burden.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, victims never want to celebrate, but on some days they at least receive news that is of comfort to them. Today is one of those days, as we will definitely ratify the first part of the European protection order, which refers to issues linked with criminal matters.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council’s specific declaration that declares the prioritisation of the negotiation, agreement and ratification of the proposal for a Directive which will extend the application of the order in the civil domain, presented by the Commission on 18 May, completes the legal instrument we are ratifying today.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, because it overcomes the main obstacle that has held up this initiative during its processing, but in particular because of the risk faced by victims throughout Europe and the measures that are introduced to protect them that are adapted to the borderless area in which we move, which is what is important.</p>
      <p sl="es">The assailants, those who threaten and assault, do not understand the legal subtleties and our work is to stop them to make Europe an area of freedom, security and democracy for all. This is the message we are sending out to the European citizens today. This regulation refers to the security of individuals, of people. Extreme care has been taken with the legal system, both in resolving legal issues and in avoiding the lowering of standards of freedom, which has been the main obstacle in initiating this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I congratulate the rapporteurs for their resilience and endeavour, and I am happy that this instrument, initially developed for certain types of particularly severe violence, such as violence on women, will cover the protection issues suffered by all types of victims, in particular those threatened by terrorism or organised crime.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the adoption of this directive marks the end of a long and positive legislative process that began at the December 2009 European Council. To begin with, 12 Member States, including Italy, led the call for a European approach to victim protection and support, aimed primarily at the victims – women – of gender violence, including domestic violence and stalking, as well as other groups of highly vulnerable victims, such as children and persons with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Protection Order is an instrument based on mutual recognition in the field of judicial cooperation on criminal matters. It is also a useful system for keeping aggressors at a distance and punishing them, by forbidding them to have access to the places where the protected person lives and imposing restrictions on their contacting or approaching the victim.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, this is a positive step towards achieving a European area of freedom and justice and a step forwards in terms of cooperation between Member States in order to guarantee Europeans’ fundamental rights in practice.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is measures like this that strengthen our people’s trust in the authority of the European institutions and, for that reason, I will conclude by congratulating all those who have worked on this important dossier, especially Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Romero López.

      <p sl="sk">We welcome the initiative to protect victims of violence, which must clearly be brought to a conclusion from a legal perspective. The protective measures adopted in one Member State must be recognised, managed and enforceable. Thanks to this system, a protected person will be able to avoid parallel proceedings in individual Member States. There should also be appropriate mechanisms for preventing the repetition of a criminal act or the perpetration of another possibly more serious crime. Criminal acts are often repeated in the case of gender-based violence, although this also occurs with other forms of criminal act, such as human trafficking or sexual abuse of minors, for example. Perpetrators of criminal acts can move freely within the EU. It is therefore necessary to enable the scope of application of protective measures adopted in one Member State to be extended in order to protect the victim of a criminal act who wishes to exercise the right to freedom of movement. If this is not done, victims of criminal acts will face a tough choice between surrendering the right of an EU citizen to freedom of movement and surrendering the right to protection. That, of course, is unacceptable.</p>

I think that the natural consequence of closer cooperation between the Member States in their fight against crime is to extend the protection offered to the victims of those crimes on a European scale.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European protection order, as a joint legal basis, is aimed primarily at protecting victims of domestic violence. Statistics prove how many people have been waiting for the document. My country, Poland, recorded over 100 000 cases of domestic violence last year, and this is certainly not the full scale of the problem. Many of the victims do not reveal their tragedy because of their fear of the abuser and their belief that the judicial system would not be able to provide them with efficient protection. This is why protection at European level is so important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Under the directive, victims of domestic violence will have legal protection outside their current country of residence. Protective measures such as a restraining order or a court order to leave the house which have been issued in one country will apply in equal force in another country which has undertaken to protect victims using the European protection order.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that the broad protection guaranteed by this directive will be an effective and efficient way to help improve the situation of victims of violence, and will give them the opportunity of a new life.</p>

The European Parliament has been working very credibly to combat violence, and particularly violence against women, for many years now. To this extent, the initiative started by the Spanish Presidency of the time for a European protection order fell and continues to fall on open ears. Scattered across the countries of the European Union there are currently around 100 000 women alone in victim protection programmes. These victims sometimes move their place of residence, perhaps to another EU country. We are currently in the process of creating a European legal area – a Europe of freedom, security and justice – as a European added value. As a system of mutual recognition, the European protection order is an important part of this.

The introduction of the European Protection Order therefore also creates a need to perform an extensive comparison of protective measures in civil matters in the individual Member States, in order to achieve an equal level of protection for people shielded by an EU Protection Order. I am pleased that the European Council, in accordance with the resolution on a roadmap for strengthening the rights and protection of victims in criminal proceedings, supported the interlinking of the Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters with the Directive on the European Protection Order. People repeatedly threatened by perpetrators of criminal acts surely deserve to have a good, effective and comprehensive system of protection throughout the EU.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, victims of violence often move to a different area in order to distance themselves from the dramatic events that have taken place. We cannot allow perpetrators of violence to exploit differences in legal systems and to pursue such victims to another Member State and to continue to harass them there. Victim protection must be the central issue – whether we are talking about sexual assaults, stalking or child abuse. Legal harmonisation would contradict the principle of subsidiarity, however, and in view of the different legal systems in this sensitive area must be rejected. Protection measures therefore need to be adopted under each country’s national legislation in order to provide victims with protection across national borders. This applies in particular to those Member States that believe they have to apply Sharia law. Domestic violence cannot be justified on either cultural or religious grounds, and that is a principle that should apply throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Now it is very important that we get the other half of the work done and to complete this directive with the legislative instrument I have introduced for civil and administrative proceedings. It is also very important that we do not start giving out information to women before we have completed our work, because there is the danger that some women will think they are protected when they travel abroad when they are not. So let us complete all our work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The moment we have the necessary coverage for all women who are in danger when they go outside their Member States then we should, together with the Member States, launch an information campaign, which I think will be very important. It is also one of those elements which can, I think, very usefully go into the European Year of Citizens, where we can explain to the female citizens who are suffering what we have done in order to protect them when they utilise their right to free movement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with Mr Gustafsson, Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, that it is not enough to stop now at the protection order. We have to go a step further. That is also one of the reasons why I put the comprehensive victims package on the table, setting basic rights for victims in criminal proceedings. Here I have put emphasis on the special position of women in this procedure – for instance the right to be heard by a female police officer or the right not to meet the accused in court. Because that is the case it would also be very good if the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality could invest time in working on this victims package.</p>

At the moment the Vilnius Institute is collecting data on how many women and girls there are in Europe – we are speaking about our territory here in Europe – who are victims of FGM or who could become victims of FGM. That will come up in the spring and then we should draw together the conclusions for possible action.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is only the beginning of the work which we have to do in order to make Europe a safe place for women and to reduce the number of victims.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I think it is very important to closely follow the application of the European protection order. We refer to filing a report, but these reports should be followed by real protection. We need troops: we can approve good laws, but if we do not provide countries with the necessary means, the victims will not feel confident and they will continue to keep quiet for fear of being assaulted again. Therefore, it is necessary that the judges and the police have the training and means to be able to do their job properly. That is real justice.</p>
      <p sl="es">So many victims complain about the application of a law that does not meet their needs. It is necessary, therefore, that we pool our efforts, that we insist on the statistics to see how this instrument is working, which I believe is really necessary. I ask the Member States to make the effort to understand and apply this regulation, as that’s what we have worked for, and we consider that we have made it clear.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that from now on, the doors to victim rights are wide open in Europe, that women and men can count on this, and other instruments, which will make victims come forward and put a stop to those that they fear.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today through our voices, and tomorrow through our votes, we will tell the victims that we will never forget their rights in the European Parliament, the support that society owes them, and mostly importantly, justice. I can tell you that it is justice that keeps all the victims alive, regardless of the crime committed against them.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I am very pleased with this document and I congratulate the rapporteur for doing such a huge and important job for the European Union’s citizens. The European protection order is a major step forward, establishing an effective framework for cooperation between law enforcement authorities in criminal matters. It is also a very important instrument because it touches on a very sensitive area – the prevention of crimes threatening a person’s health, life and psychological and sexual integrity, as well as the protection of people who are already victims of crime. I am always standing up for the safe and proper promotion of the free movement of people within the European Union because, having granted EU citizens the right to move freely and work in any Member State, we also have to ensure both their security and the protection of other associated rights. This is precisely why the establishment of the legal framework necessary for the effective protection of individuals is an extremely important task for us, the EU’s law-makers, and I am pleased to see that we are moving forward rapidly as we perform this task. This is also why here, in the European Parliament, in the near future we will be awaiting the Commission’s proposal on the mutual recognition of safeguards in criminal matters, which we could consider and which is necessary for the effective functioning of the European protection order.</p>

      <p sl="hu">With our world locked in a struggle with the economic crisis, violence, too, is taking its victims in increasing numbers and will not stop at country borders. There has been a sharp increase in numbers in the past year: even if we only look at people between 18 and 34 years of age, 14% of them fell victim to domestic violence and abuse. This is one of the reasons why it is very important for us, despite the immense differences in the legal traditions of countries as regards justice, to be able to take Community-level action in an increasing number of fields for the cross-border protection of victims, whether they are women or children. Tomorrow’s vote and the final approval of the directive therefore represent a considerable success and a momentous occasion. I am particularly pleased that besides Poland, the Hungarian Presidency, too, had a hand in this success.

      <p sl="en">We are about two weeks after the international day for the elimination of violence against women. It was a symbolic day to remind us about the ‘ugly face of abuse’ and the terrifying numbers got more attention than usual: more women between the age of 16 and 44 die because of violence than because of cancer or traffic accidents. Every third woman is a victim of violence during her life. We have said many times before and I will say again: it is our responsibility to protect these victims! The European Protection Order is a very important step in this direction. Furthermore, victims (not ‘only’ women) of all kinds of violence will enjoy the same protection in every Member State which can contribute – via inspiring European criminal law – towards realising a European area of justice. I think the day when the regulation on the EPO is applicable (in three years) will be an important day. It may not be an international day of anything but, more importantly, it will give victims a real chance for protection – throughout Europe, an equal treatment of protection, no matter which Member State they choose to live in.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State (13036/3/2011 – C7-0451/2011 – 2007/0229(COD)) (Rapporteur: Véronique Mathieu) (A7-0434/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-132-000" speaker_id="4412" name="Véronique Mathieu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is currently undergoing a massive transformation: in economic, monetary, social, demographic and migratory terms. The changes sweeping across and shaking up Europe are considerable and call on us to reconsider European policies. Europe is at a turning point and we have a duty to address these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the main challenges facing us in the years ahead is a shortage of labour. Our low population growth is the Achilles heel of Europe. By 2050, one out of three European citizens will be over 65 years old and 20 million skilled jobs will not be filled. We would need 3.2 million immigrants a year between now and 2050 to keep the age structure as it currently is. Resorting to immigration is justified and made necessary by this demographic deficit. It is high time we accepted this state of affairs, got to grips with these changes and ultimately did something about it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Aware of this problem, the European Commission has proposed a package of measures: the blue card Directive in 2009, the Directive on the single permit, the Directive on seasonal workers or even intragroup transfers seek to address these issues. We should now seize the moment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘single permit’ Directive provides a partial response to the labour crisis looming on the European horizon. It also makes it possible to control the workforce. To regulate and simplify legal migration, it is better to control all forms of migration and remove any temptations for fraud and illegal migration. The ‘single permit’ Directive allows workers from third countries to come and work in Europe with standards and regulations in place. It protects workers from third countries from people traffickers and other criminal gangs profiting from and abusing their fragility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Permit application procedures have been greatly simplified. A single residence and work permit can be obtained in a maximum of four months. Applications can be made either by the employer, in Europe, or by the worker, in the third country in which he or she resides. What is more, there is a right to appeal in the procedures of Member States in which the applications are made. Similarly, the information shown on the single permit is standardised and simplified throughout the European Union. It is the same information shown on the work permit. Additional information may be requested. It is optional and its content is closely supervised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As well as significantly simplifying procedures for work and residence permits, the single permit will therefore allow us to give third-country workers and workers from the European Union a common set of rights. Until now there has been a genuine disparity between Member States, and we could not put up with this any longer. Failing to recognise the rights of foreign workers who bring so much to our economies was wrong. This step forward is both fair and necessary. The equal treatment of workers is at the heart of this directive, which puts third-country workers and European workers on an equal footing. Third-country workers enjoy the same rights as European workers in terms of pay and conditions for dismissal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same rules also apply to the recognition of diplomas, freedom of association and membership of a professional organisation, social security, tax benefits and access to public goods and services. In addition, those with a job will enjoy equal treatment when it comes to access to education and to employment. Employment services will also be accessible to the unemployed and thus to those most in need of such services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The export of pensions will no longer be conditional on the existence of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries. Equal treatment will again be the rule here. This step forward means we can recognise the value of work carried out by citizens from third countries and take this into account when giving them pension rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I am immensely proud to have taken part in these lengthy negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank the European Commission and, in particular, Cecilia Malmström and her services, which have enabled the directive to see the light of day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to thank the successive Spanish, Belgian, Hungarian and Polish presidencies for their commitment. I would like to thank my fellow Members for their relevant proposals and support in the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can now congratulate ourselves on the fruit of our labour. It is a step forward in which we can rejoice and which reflects the image of a fair and dignified Europe, which respects each worker that contributes to European growth.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all a great thank you to the rapporteur Ms Mathieu, and also to the rapporteur for the opinion Mr Cercas, and to all the Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for their excellent work on this proposal. Thank you also, Ms Mathieu, for the nice words you said about Cecilia Malmström. I will certainly convey these words to her.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you are aware, the Commission presented this proposal back in 2007, which seems like another century because since then we have arrived at the Lisbon Treaty, but at that time our aim was – and still is – to simplify procedures by introducing one permit for residence and work, while protecting migrant workers by guaranteeing them employment-related rights on an equal footing with nationals.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal is one of the main building blocks of the European Union’s labour migration policy. It is a complex proposal as it addresses both immigration and employment issues. If adopted by Parliament and the Council, this directive will confirm the important contribution third-country workers make to our economies and to our societies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has already confirmed that the text agreed upon is in line with the original objectives. If the text is endorsed by Parliament, this directive will be the first one on legal migration under the ordinary legislative procedure introduced in this area by the Lisbon Treaty. Indeed, Parliament’s involvement as a fully fledged legislator has made it possible because there is a substantial contribution by Parliament to achieving a more rights-based instrument, ensuring, for example, social security rights for registered unemployed workers who have earned them through previous contributions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally I would like to raise an institutional point. The Commission is very pleased that the last pending issue, the reporting mechanism on implementation, was also solved in a satisfactory manner. In line with that interinstitutional agreement, the Commission decided to propose in this specific case that Member States provide explanatory documents when putting these EU rules into national law. Given the wide scope and the wide range of rights and policy areas involved – social security, education, labour law – this was a very important issue and we are pleased that the Council accepted this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me hope, Ms Mathieu, that Parliament will endorse the agreement and thereby adopt the directive, which will facilitate matters for potential employers and guarantee legal security for non-EU workers throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I would like to begin by wholeheartedly thanking the rapporteur, Véronique Mathieu, for all the hard work she has invested into such a delicate and sensitive subject, the difficulty of which clearly underlines its importance. As others have mentioned, this is the first time that we are passing a law under the codecision procedure on the possibility of having third country citizens work legally within the European Union countries.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This law provides certain advantages: an advantage to third country citizens wishing to work in the European Union, because for the first time we will be providing a legal means by which this will be possible. It also presents an advantage to European Union countries by granting them the faculty to accept workers from third countries via a legal form, without depriving them of the discretion to decide on how many work permits to issue. A further advantage of the possibility to work legally is that it cuts down upon, or attacks the possibility of illegal immigration. This law therefore, is in itself a means of combating illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="mt">It is ironic and unfortunate that when it came to the vote within the Committee, the Socialist Group chose to abstain, when one would have thought that it would have approved of such a law, which, for the first time opened up this right to third country citizens - a right that will also provide certain guarantees of rights.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I believe that this abstention proves that there are those who seem to prefer the law of the jungle rather having a law that sets clear standards for those who come to work in our countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as shadow rapporteur and a member of the Socialist Group, I first want to express that we cannot vote against a directive that clearly is a small step forward, as well as having won two battles we pursued with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which were the issues of the exporting of pensions and professional training for migrants. We cannot, therefore, vote against it.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, this is not the directive that we had promised in Tampere and that we had promised for ten years in the Green Paper; this is not the directive for equal rights: there are still very significant exclusions in terms of working and social security rights; decisions still remain in the hands of the Member States, which shouldn’t be discretional in nature, but rather regulated.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, it is a step forward, but it is not enough; it is very far from the ambition we Europeans should have. We have seen too much of the accountant’s short-termist view, the bureaucrat’s selfish point of view, the view of those who think in the short-term, and not the long term view for the great opportunity for which we have had to set a framework directive so as not to leave anyone or any right out.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in 2008 this House voted in the Return Directive, which immediately became one of the most criticised EU laws. A large number of countries outside the European Union and a huge number of NGOs from within and outside the EU expressed their disappointment and frustration. We promised at the time that measures to send home people who came and stayed irregularly in the EU would be accompanied by genuine legislation dealing with legal migration, making it more coherent and human.</p>
      <p sl="de">This task has become one of the main priorities of the Commission, whose ambition is to see the entire package on migration adopted by the end of 2012. I hope Parliament shares this ambition.</p>
      <p sl="de">The single application procedure for residence is the first one to be adopted; it was discussed at length and negotiated not only with the Council but also among political groups in this Parliament. I want to congratulate Véronique Mathieu for her determination during the entire process; it was not easy at all. I am convinced we did the right thing and I regret that our Socialist colleagues abstained during the last vote. Certainly the single permit in its actual wording is not the best it could be. However it is much better when compared to the situation in many Member States. I dare to say that it is an honest attempt to provide people who want to come and study and work within the European Union with a better mechanism to do so, and also maybe to protect them from the humiliation they have to suffer in various Member States at present.</p>
      <p sl="de">I cannot imagine the European Union asking to be taken seriously and claiming to be an international actor without minimum standards on migration and asylum.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think it is clear that for all of us the legislation that we are talking about this evening maybe is not the most perfect that we would have hoped for. However I think many of us see it as a positive step forward, and certainly analysis of it that has been done says that it may be positive in terms of integration for the many thousands of people affected by the legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a simplification in terms of putting together the residence and work permit as a single piece of paperwork. That, we know, was controversial, as well in the way in which it was discussed. But it should be a simplification and, as has been pointed out, there is a due requirement of time so that these applications should not be left sitting on desks as they so often are in many of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the rights section of it – which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was largely dealing with – I think we have made some progress there. The most important part of it is that we are looking at equality of treatment with Member State nationals in a large number of places, not least in terms of pay, rights of freedom of association and the right to educational/vocational training so that people are actually able to improve their skills base, which is for their own benefit and for the benefit of the company with which they work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The social security dimension is also important and I think that the changes that Parliament managed to make on pensions is one which we should be proud of.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the combined work and residence permit for third-country nationals in the EU came in like a lion and is going out like a lamb, to coin a phrase. This in no way opens the way for a truly simplified regulation for third-country nationals who would like to work in the EU. That remains the case even if residence is increasingly being linked with work. In many cases that may be all well and good – but it is the only focus here, and we see that as a problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, we do not feel that this directive is a step in the right direction. Firstly, this is because its scope is too narrow. Its provisions are narrow-minded and provincial. It is not just that it is only to be applicable to the executing Member State and not to the EU as a whole; that does not even get mentioned any more. It is also that the regulation is not to apply to family members of Union citizens if they are third-country nationals, nor to seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees or people under international or temporary protection. This gives rise to all kinds of individual directives, and as a result there are different classes of third-country nationals with differing rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that there is no real simplification or legal harmonisation, and this is true through the mere fact that the Member States actually have the final say on all matters – such as whether it is the employer or the employee who is to apply for the permit. If it is the employer, the potential employee may not even get to see the application, such as in cases where it is rejected. He will have absolutely no opportunity to comment legally in any form whatsoever. We are also critical of the fact that an application may be deemed inadmissible if the Member State sets quotas for the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point I would like to make – and I will concede this to the rapporteur – is that it is good that pension entitlements will be recognised. It is absolutely unacceptable, however, that there is not completely equal treatment with employees who are EU nationals. There are to be considerable restrictions – and these will depend on the class of person – when it comes to vocational training, social benefits – such as for family members – and access to public housing. That is really not acceptable. If that is made a fundamental principle, then it is a mistake and we cannot support it. That is why we are rejecting this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am, in fact, perpetually shocked and surprised to see so little critical thinking applied to immigration in this House, which is nevertheless said to represent the peoples of Europe. Immigration which has, after all, brought with it so much alienation, so much uprootedness and also so much crime in recent decades, the real costs of which should be considered huge for the societies of most of our European countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, obviously, I am not going to be foolish enough to draw, with no valid reason, any links between what is known as ‘the blue card’ for highly skilled immigrants and the massive non-European immigration of the past decades. However, I do have, and will continue to have, the greatest misgivings about the official European policy, which have today, once again, been confirmed. That policy continues, for ideological reasons, to favour mass immigration, despite the real situation on the ground and the dramatic unemployment figures, for example, when this flies in the face of all common sense.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As far as what we call ‘legal immigration’, or even the immigration of the highly skilled, is concerned: what is the situation with the legal and semi-legal immigration which directly results from the immigration of those we designate ‘highly skilled’? Who can guarantee that those people will leave when the highly skilled person leaves, even if they desire to do so? I still have major issues with an economic policy which is reliant on immigration, which, in turn, causes us constant problems. This kind of policy has proved to be totally disastrous in the past and we ought to take lessons from that.</p>

The foundation of the whole system, that is the abolition of border controls at internal borders, coupled with the control of external borders, has cracked open. As we all know, the borders are not being controlled effectively or efficiently. Instead of putting the foundation of the system in order again, the European Union just keeps on extending the system and making it even more unwieldy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The introduction of a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State is a new step towards an immigration policy which has been conceived and organised by the European Union from start to finish, without Member States retaining any right to pursue their own policies, to set their own priorities within their policies or to respond to their own problems in a manner commensurate with the wishes of their own constituents.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is a drastic measure which is undermining an essential element of the democracy of Member States, namely the right to decide for themselves who to allow into their territory and under what conditions.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, there is perhaps nothing that lends a degree of uniformity to a national or supranational entity more than cohesion in the way in which those perceived as outsiders are treated. Historically, numerous federations of independent states have drawn very close when they adopted uniform policies for dealing with the presence of third-country nationals in their territory. The uniform policy for dealing with foreign nationals in the various states in the US is often cited as an example of immigration policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today we are again debating a draft directive which, any initial reservations notwithstanding, goes one step further, by making provision for common rules for addressing the residency status of third-country nationals in the territory of the European Union. Also, the role of the rapporteur, Ms Mathieu, whom I too should like to take my turn in thanking, in overcoming any disagreements is a truly well-established role and I cannot understand why the socialist group abstained in the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="el">The immediate benefits of this directive are obvious: less bureaucracy, greater security of law in the Schengen area, confidence-building between the Member States, more effective action on illegal immigration, common rules for assessing the work qualifications of third-country nationals and benefits for social insurance and health care.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are even greater benefits in the medium term. The fact that third-country nationals are treated in the same way in Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and every other Member State of the Union is also a step towards a standard approach to our common future. I therefore believe that a vote in favour of this directive will be an important step for the legislature, for the European Parliament, a huge step towards the adoption of a common European immigration policy and, ultimately, an important step on the route towards European integration.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Although agreement could not be reached on all issues, I am pleased that, in the final agreement on this Directive, provision was made for the portability of pensions. This is something we should welcome. However, it is disappointing that we failed to find a common solution in the European Parliament itself regarding the inclusion of individual categories of workers in the content of this Directive. Here I have in mind seasonal workers, workers transferred within a company or asylum seekers.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Unfortunately, this Directive does not exactly strengthen the principle of legal equivalence for all third-country workers. Clearly, I would like to congratulate and thank the Commission (because we have a Member of the Commission here) for making proposals both regarding seasonal workers and workers transferred within a company, and intensive discussions are currently taking place in Parliament. I hope that we will find an appropriate solution and will adopt a common decision.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would therefore like to wish that, when addressing migration policy issues in future, we will understand that third-country workers have the same rights as European Union citizens if they are residing and working legally, because their contribution to our countries’ economic growth and the growth of our social well-being is inescapable.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Ms Mathieu for the excellent job she has done. We should be pleased that the citizens of third countries want to come to the European Union and our Member States to work. We need them because we are short of workers in many areas and we also have an ageing population.</p>
      <p sl="sv">For me, it is self-evident that we need to make it as easy and as problem-free as possible for these people to live and work in the EU. I therefore welcome this report concerning the creation of a single application procedure for third-country nationals. Those who come here to work will in all likelihood want to live and spend their lives here, too. We should be able to provide that opportunity with as little red tape as possible. That would benefit everyone involved, and we will achieve it with this directive.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I welcome the fact that we will finally have this directive in place. It will benefit many people who help to maintain welfare standards in our Member States and it will bring prosperity to the EU once the crisis that we are currently experiencing is over.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the report we are debating in fact proposes making the rights enjoyed by migrant workers fully comparable to those enjoyed by European citizens. These rights truly underpin our economies and social systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">In some cases, the measures contained in this report would even give workers from third countries staying in a Member State preferential treatment, such as tax benefits and ad hoc forms of assistance to enter the job market.</p>
      <p sl="it">To be perfectly honest, I think the European and national institutions should support our own citizens first and foremost, especially in an economic and social crisis such as the one we are experiencing now. Adding to the range of rights enjoyed by third-country workers would mean ignoring the terrible situation in which tens of millions of families find themselves in our countries today, and turning our backs on our own vulnerable groups, such as the young, women and unemployed Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="it">The statistics on poverty in Europe reveal a striking picture: over 60 million people are at risk of poverty; in other words, 15% of the population have to make do on less than 60% of the national median income. One in eight people lives in a family in which nobody is working, and one in five children is at risk of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="it">Faced with this situation, European do-gooders are thinking about how to sort things out for third-country workers, but in actual fact they do not even know how to ensure decent living standards for our own workers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Commission thinks its plans will help to meet future labour requirements. Joint residence and work permits are to be issued generously. It would be better, however, if residence were linked to specific job opportunities in the labour market. Even then, wholesale migration is unlikely to be the answer. In addition, a bunch of rights are intended to make migrants equal to nationals – in other words, equal working conditions, recognition of professional qualifications, tax relief, trade union rights and equal social benefits.</p>
      <p sl="de">Who, ladies and gentlemen, is supposed to pay for this? Our indebted euro area countries? Certainly not the migrants, because their income is around 30% lower than that of the average EU citizen. Naturally, this also means that less tax will be paid. Furthermore, migrants are much more likely to suffer unemployment and are less well qualified. Under this system, it is mainly migrants who would benefit from claiming social security – because they are a population group that has a particularly low employment rate and tends to have a higher level of poverty. As a result, migrants would be overrepresented in the social security systems. That will certainly not help our labour markets.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the ageing societies of the European Union have a great need for a regulated influx of migrants and employees who contribute to the competitiveness of the EU and the sustainability of our social security systems. In the coming years the IT sector will be short by about 700 000, and the health care industry by nearly 2 million employees. Europe is increasingly losing its appeal among highly qualified third-country employees. It is less appealing than the United States, Canada, Australia or Switzerland. In order for us to become more attractive it is important to establish a common migration policy, and in this respect the current proposal for a ‘Single Permit’ Directive represents a major step. The political compromise over the scope of the Directive is the result of long negotiations. There have also been extensive debates regarding equal treatment.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are glad that the transferability of pensions and the right to continuing vocational training were eventually included; to my fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party I would like to say that with our abstention we intended to express that we had wished to achieve much more in the course of these negotiations. We must carry on with this work in several fields in order for a true common European migration policy to be formed. On the one hand there is some backlog in respect of the blue card in the transposition and application of adopted directives. On the other hand, headway must also be made as regards the directives on intra-corporate transfers and seasonal workers. In conclusion I would like to state that if Europe truly wishes to be competitive it needs to open up its labour market to employees from the new Member States. In the following days we will be discussing Romania and Bulgaria; we need them, too, partly in respect of seasonal, and partly in respect of highly skilled labour.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this directive calls for common rights for third-party migrants working in the EU. If adopted it would remove what little rights remain or are still left to Member States to determine their own immigration policy. It wants third-party migrants to enjoy comparable rights to those of EU nationals, including working conditions, social security and access to public services.</p>
      <p sl="en">But of course not all Member States have the same level of social security and public services, and of course a citizen of a state, by definition, enjoys the benefits of that citizenship, or should enjoy the benefits of that citizenship that non-citizens do not. If citizens do not have exclusive rights, then the concept of citizenship itself is meaningless. What this will mean is that third-party migrants will flood to those states that have the highest levels of public housing, social security and public services. No prizes for guessing that Britain will be top of their list as a destination. Equally unsurprisingly, I can tell you that UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this directive.</p>

I believe that with this directive we have succeeded, on the one hand, in creating certain incentives for those who are actually needed in the Member States and will therefore be able to find work, while, on the other hand, maintaining checks and thus managing legal admissions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I consider it particularly important that we incorporate a ruling that establishes that naturally it remains up to the Member States to set quotas, and that then – once such quotas are in place and if they are being or have been used up – a decision of inadmissibility may be made; in other words, the Member State can then refuse immigration. In the final event, these are regulations that are intended to lead to a clear decision being made within four months as to whether or not a third-country national may migrate to a particular place within the Union. This will kill two birds with one stone: labour will be found and come here by legal means, while at the same time we combat illegality.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The frequently complicated administrative steps for the adoption of economic migrants must be simplified, as there are substantial differences between the various Member States at present. I welcome the fact that the Directive provides the possibility of combating the exploitation and discrimination which working immigrants are often exposed to. The draft stipulates equal treatment on the basis of a common set of rights in areas related to the labour market. Another advantage is ensuring better protection than such workers enjoy at present, on the basis of the international agreements currently in force, which have been ratified only by some Member States. Since economic migrants take part in the economic life of their host countries, they must have a legal status that protects them from exclusion and discrimination. This status will make it possible to combat the unfair competition which often follows on from an absence of legal status.</p>

The agreement negotiated with the Council is not entirely satisfactory, but can be considered a step forward. The single permit will, in actual fact, be applied solely to a limited category of workers, which goes against the very principle of the single procedure that this directive was intended to introduce at the outset. At the same time, it is unfair that working conditions and derived benefits will not be entirely equivalent to those applicable to EU citizens. However, I cannot claim that this comes as a surprise, given that Romanians and Bulgarians, who are European citizens, also continue to be afforded discriminatory treatment on the labour market in some Member States. I believe that the errors and shortcomings of this directive can be redressed by the new directives on seasonal workers and intra-company transfers.</p>

In my opinion, the effort to define a common set of rights for workers from third countries reminds us in particular that European citizens, as well as employees or workers in another Member State, cannot always count on the same set of rights. Our friends from Romania and Bulgaria cannot even get work legally in some Member States, and seasonal agricultural workers in southern Member States often report experiencing appalling working conditions. In this context we should perhaps be talking not just about the employment rights of workers from third countries, but rather about equal EU employment rights for all workers in general.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the rapporteur has said that legal migration will increase the EU’s competiveness, but she is just a little bit coy about explaining how.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me help her out. Flood the market with any commodity – and of course labour is seen as a commodity by globalists – and the price will be driven down. As I have said repeatedly, the only way in which an unprotected developed world can compete with the Third World and emerging economies is by pushing the wage rates of our workers down to their levels. We need protection for our industries and workers and not competitiveness built on the back of our workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur goes on to seek to justify immigration by reference to demographic change in Europe, falling birth rates and ageing population. However, birth rates fall in response to economic demands in the home and can be reversed by imaginative social policies. Furthermore, if you bring Third World immigrants to Europe, they do not become substitute Europeans. They bring the Third World with them.</p>

These must be abolished in order to increase Europe’s prosperity and attract a highly qualified workforce.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The introduction of a single application procedure for residence and work permits will make a significant contribution.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that Commissioner Reding is treating immigration and the issue of employees from third countries together, because this raises three problems. The first one is that labour from third countries cannot be treated otherwise, or at least I cannot treat it otherwise, than as strike breakers in a strike. Because Europe, realising that there is nothing it can do about its own employees and unemployment, takes the easier path: why, let us import employees from outside Europe cheaply, at low wages, and disregard the problems of the European people. I would only like to remind my fellow Members that the reason why they are sitting here in the European Parliament is to deal first and foremost with the problems of the European people.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Our job is primarily to curb European, and not African unemployment for instance. The second problem I would like to bring to your attention are the differences in salaries. Why is it not first ensured that a Hungarian employee earns as much as, say, a German, a French or an Italian employee? The third problem is the issue of immigration itself. Immigration into Europe must be stopped immediately; we all saw what happened in London, Madrid or Berlin. The same will happen in other Member States with similar critical social tensions. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the rights of third-country nationals are once again being expanded on the pretext of simplifying procedures and improving the management of immigration. If immigration remains at a high level in times of rising unemployment, then clearly local people will be crowded out of the jobs market. It is also strange that the supposedly highly qualified workers who are to make up for the supposed shortage of skilled labour in the EU all too often end up in unskilled sectors of the economy – in agriculture, in the building trade and in the hospitality sector; in other words, in precisely those areas in which workers are laid off more quickly than skilled workers. That also increases the likelihood of their having to be supported by the social safety net.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead of recklessly giving third-country nationals access to social security via the EU’s back door, we need to seriously investigate which sectors are recruiting immigrants, what level of education and training they have, and what costs this imposes on the general public. EU migration policy must not result in unchecked mass immigration and in workers being crowded out by competing labour – all at the behest of big business.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather bewildered to hear some fellow Members saying that this directive would allegedly encourage unchecked mass immigration. The reality is the exact opposite. We are talking here about those with a proper work and residence permit, and if they are doing the same work as an EU citizen, then such people should also receive the same usual types of social benefits within the European Union as any other person would get. This safeguards those who work properly and with the right papers; it is not opening any floodgates.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also find it most amusing that some Members are complaining that too many groups are excluded, while others are complaining that mass immigration will take place. I congratulate the rapporteur. She seems to have found the golden middle way between giving the Member States the necessary individual powers of differentiation in certain decision areas and, on the other hand, providing a certain guarantee of social security for those working according to the rules. It should be a matter of course that family benefits depend on length of stay, but that someone who has earned a pension is able to take it with them if they have worked according to the rules. I therefore find it rather strange that people’s concerns that many workers will be crowded out of the labour market are being fuelled here. This directive has nothing to do with that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am certainly not going to intervene in the polemics which have started in this House. I think this is a question to be solved by the House itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the numbers of migrant workers, I would like to say that this proposal gives the freedom to each Member State to decide for itself how many migrant workers it wishes to accept. Let me also underline that those migrant workers pay taxes and social security contributions when working legally, as well as contributing to the cultural richness of our societies.</p>
      <p sl="en">To those who suggest that the equal treatment provisions allow for too many limitations – I agree that the rapporteur seems to be right in the middle because there are opinions on both sides, to one extreme and to the other – I would like to underline that the primary aim of the Commission was to ensure workers’ rights as regards employment-related rights and those earned through contribution. This means, for example, the need to ensure work-related vocational training but not necessarily completely equal treatment as regards education in general.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, one of the objectives of this directive is to establish a level playing field for migrant workers from day one without any minimum employment period. Let me also point out that the outcome of the political agreement resulted in provisions which are even more inclusive than the original Commission proposal as regards access to social security for unemployed migrants and freedom of association. Some restrictions are introduced on access to education and housing, but the work-related rights in vocational training are kept, which in the Commission’s opinion results in a balanced approach. Here of course I am also speaking for the relevant Commissioner, my colleague Cecilia Malmström.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the end of this long but fruitful negotiation process on a highly important proposal in the area of legal migration, I sincerely hope that Parliament will come to an agreement and adopt a directive that will ensure the equal treatment of legally residing migrant workers so that they can benefit fully from employment-related rights. Such a directive should be seen as a first, and an important, step to be completed later on by other instruments, such as the ones dealing with seasonal workers and intra-corporate transferees.</p>

    <intervention id="1-166-000" speaker_id="96932" name="Birgit Sippel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, in the current times it is more important than ever to keep repeating that the European Union is more than just a market. It is a community of values, and it is precisely in difficult times that it must prove itself to be a strong community of values in all policy areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU and its Member States are based on the common principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. An indispensable element of the rule of law in the context of criminal proceedings is the presumption of innocence, supported by clear and comprehensive procedural rights for the accused persons. Following the directive on the right to interpretation and to translation, the new directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings is a further important cornerstone in ensuring that suspected and accused persons are given a fair trial across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">The development of equal standards for procedural rights in criminal matters will strengthen our citizens’ trust in the judicial systems of the Member States. The mutual recognition of court decisions will also encourage this. An individual can only comprehensively exercise his procedural rights if he knows what those rights are. For a fair trial, it is crucial that people are aware of their rights and that they know what the accusation against them is. If authorities fail to observe these procedural rights, then they jeopardise the fairness of the proceedings and risk miscarriages of justice.</p>
      <p sl="de">The existing EU legal framework in the judicial area focuses on improved cooperation between judicial authorities. In contrast, the new directive concentrates on our citizens and the rights they enjoy in criminal proceedings. It states that police officers and prosecutors must provide people who have been arrested with written information concerning their rights in simple terms in a language they can understand. In addition to the right to interpretation and translation, this includes in particular informing them of the accusation against them, of the right to legal assistance and of the right to be heard by a judge without delay following arrest. In addition, Parliament has been able to expand the specific rights of which the suspect is to be informed. We have succeeded in integrating into the directive the right of access to medical assistance, the right to communication with relatives and the right to remain silent.</p>
      <p sl="de">No one knows in advance how long a suspected person will remain in pre-trial detention, for how long he will be deprived of his liberty. It is therefore important that he is informed of his rights at an early stage and is also given access to material evidence for and against him. The accused person must not become the object of the criminal proceedings, but rather must be able to play an active part in the proceedings. The Member States must now adopt and implement the directive as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to the services of Parliament and of the Commission – and I would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, whose perseverance and really outstanding cooperation have made this report possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is now important that the Council and Commission bring the follow-up measures to this directive to a rapid conclusion jointly with the European Parliament, thereby creating uniform standards and fair trials throughout the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for the very solid work done and for the efficient way the negotiations on this dossier were concluded, which has permitted a first reading agreement. I would also like to praise the role of Mr Albrecht, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as the important role played by all the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the European Parliament in general because it has contributed to maintaining the level of ambition of the Commission’s proposal. One thing in particular which I believe is very important for our citizens, the letter of rights, has been maintained in the final text as well as the actual list of rights and the moment when the rights apply. I also welcome the fact that additional rights were added to the list of rights, notably the right to remain silent, which shows again that it is very good that Parliament has codecision possibilities because Parliament preserves the rights of the individual.</p>
      <p sl="en">The measure on the right of information in criminal proceedings, as you know, is part of the Procedural Rights Roadmap and the implementation of this roadmap is one of my top priorities. The letter of rights and right to information is now the second measure adopted; with the right to interpretation and translation having already been adopted. So we are progressing quickly on this issue and I think that is good for the Europe of the citizens and of rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">In some Member States I am asked the question: why do you do this – are those rights not the usual rights that everybody has? Unfortunately it still happens in some Member States that someone can be brought to trial and not know that he has a right to a lawyer or to an interpreter. We have even heard of cases where people have been tried in court and did not know or did not understand what the accusation against them was. With this measure, accused persons will receive a Letter of Rights, in a language they understand, and will be guaranteed to receive adequate information about the charges they face. This is important in today’s Europe in which millions of people exercise their right to free movement and travel to other EU Member States, be it to work, for study or for retirement. They need to know, if they find themselves caught up in criminal proceedings, that their rights are protected and that Parliament has helped to do this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, this measure will also play a vital part in promoting mutual trust between justice systems in the EU, which in turn is necessary to enhance judicial cooperation, because without trust this cooperation cannot function.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here, together with those instruments of mutual recognition, we are creating a continent of justice, rights and security for European citizens, and I thank the parliamentarians who make this possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs I would first like to add my thanks to the rapporteur from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – I believe that we have really cooperated well here in the European Parliament, where we members of the Committee on Legal Affairs also had opportunity to contribute suggestions in the process – and also, of course, to the other group members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Naturally, I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner for Justice and Fundamental Rights on the fact that a new cornerstone of this road map to create common standards in criminal proceedings has now been achieved. I believe we are agreed that this is a very important step on the way to achieving these common standards. It is also an important step for our citizens, because only informed citizens who know their rights can exercise such rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am thus very interested about which rights we, as European citizens, will be able to exercise in future. For this reason, I am already looking to the future and I would also like to see us completing the further steps in the process as soon as possible, such as the right to access a lawyer – steps in which I will be involved as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and as shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I consider this to be extremely important. I would once again call on the Member States to give up their resistance to certain provisions and to take the common path towards creating these standards. It is hugely important. We, as Parliament, are ready to do this.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, access to information for suspected and accused persons is a key factor in ensuring fair criminal proceedings. The provision of information on rights is the basis for access to all rights. In order to prepare a defence, a person must know the details of the case in which he is being charged and of any available evidence. Suspected or accused persons do not always receive this information. Legislation and judicial practice differ considerably from one Member State to another. If suspects are not properly informed, the criminal proceedings may be unfair, which can give rise to unnecessary costs relating to delays in proceedings and to exercising appeal procedures and failed criminal investigations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There are no rules at a high enough level, and those rules which do exist are not enforced properly. No minimum standards are established in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and neither the Convention nor its enforcement mechanisms offer sufficient protection in all cases with regard to the provision of adequate information about rights and, in particular, about the charges. The manner in which these rights are reflected in Member States’ national practice varies. This reinforces the need for action at EU level. The Union’s instruments facilitating judicial cooperation between Member States are based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments, and this semi-automatic recognition requires mutual trust between judges and courts.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The available data shows that the problem of insufficient information is very serious and is not limited to particular Member States. Therefore, by adopting this Directive, we are taking another particularly important step towards better protection of basic rights in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In closing, I wish to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for their excellent collaboration on this dossier, as well as the Commissioner for the commitment she has shown in adopting rules which improve the procedural rights of defendants in criminal trials.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, also set out the basic rights of defence.</p>
      <p sl="sk">These include, for example, the right to have access to a lawyer, the right to interpretation and translation, the right to be informed of the charge, the right to a regular review of detention and the right to be brought before a court. The proposal currently before the Committee seeks to improve the rights of suspected or accused persons, especially as regards information about rights and about the charge. It also covers the situation when a person is arrested under a European Arrest Warrant for prosecution or execution of a sentence. Having common minimum standards in relation to these rights should facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition, thereby improving the functioning of judicial cooperation between Member States. I agree with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which opted for a fragmentary approach in the plan to strengthen procedural rights. The right to information was presented as the second measure of the plan, which contains half of a Letter of Rights, partly excluding other rights. These concern legal advice and legal aid, communication with relatives, employers and consular bodies, and the rights of vulnerable suspects or accused persons.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, the right to information should be supplemented with these other rights. I would like to thank you very much for your attention, Commissioner, and I hope you will take these proposals of ours into account in your report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I congratulate Ms Sippel as rapporteur for leading us to a successful conclusion and I, as always, welcome the full support and backing of Vice-President Reding.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear that a person who is arrested or questioned is in a vulnerable position and deserves to know their rights and how to apply them, but the quality of information provided is often poor. People often do not understand what rights they have, and this ignorance is exacerbated by being a foreigner and not speaking the local language. A particular need, given that we know that there is discrimination in granting of bail, is to know how to contest pre-trial detention.</p>
      <p sl="de">EU laws are needed, backed by enforcement powers, to make concrete the rights theoretically available under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament rightly fought for information to be provided as soon as possible, as soon as someone is informed they are a suspect. No one should be left for hours in a police cell to stew without knowing what is happening to them or being able to contact a lawyer or consular help.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also rightly insisted on the accused person or their lawyer having access to all material possessed by police or prosecutors that will be used as evidence, and at an early enough stage for a proper defence to be mounted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Like Vice-President Reding, I believe MEPs’ success in inserting a right to silence is very important. I am glad that my own country, the UK, has opted into this measure, whatever else it is doing elsewhere, as it did with the first one on the procedural rights road map on the right to interpretation and translation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am hopeful that the UK will also take part in the third measure on access to legal assistance and advice. The UK has a good record in the field of defence rights, so in this area my country needs to be fully engaged.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we are many years overdue in matching the strengthened cross-border powers of prosecutors with stronger rights for accused persons. I hope that we have put one more brick in the foundations of fair trials across the EU so that miscarriages of justice over measures like the European Arrest Warrants will become a thing of the past.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are debating a much-needed directive. A fair trial means that the right of defence must be respected, and the right of defence can only be asserted if persons exercising it have full information about the rights to which they are entitled in the first place. It is hard for someone who is arrested to defend themselves, and it is even harder when they are arrested in a country other than their own. The provision of full information should therefore be of particular concern to law enforcement agencies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I approve of all of the solutions in the directive, but my only concern is whether its implementation will in fact work well in every instance, as we are dealing here with a difficult and delicate matter – the independence of the judiciary. Problems may arise with the actual functioning of the directive in practice. There should be an adequate system for examining complaints relating to abuse of the powers contained in the directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this directive includes the right to information for persons facing a European arrest warrant. In the case of an EAW, it will have to be a short letter. Subjects of EAWs effectively have no meaningful rights. Provided that the form has been correctly completed, the court has no power to refuse extradition. The court cannot base its decision on the prima facie evidence – or the lack of it – against the accused person. What is worse is that some people are being extradited, not after being charged, but to face investigation.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of my constituents in London, Dr Miguel-Ángel Meizoso, is facing extradition to Spain, not for something that he is alleged to have done, but for something he is accused of that he might possibly do in the future. If you do not believe me, I can give you the case papers. An English court would reject his extradition if it had any power to do so. Giving Dr Meizoso a nice letter will not protect him and will be small consolation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though all EU Member States should respect people’s right to a fair trial, national procedures on information in criminal proceedings vary considerably from one country to another.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some Member States provide for accused persons to receive only oral information about their procedural rights, while others provide information – especially if it is technical – only in writing or at the request of the accused. Since over 8 million criminal proceedings are brought in the European Union every year, it is easy to see that an information system that is still so varied and heterogeneous is inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore agree with the content and aims of this directive. I am referring especially to the general rule making it compulsory to provide accused persons with information about their procedural rights before proceedings begin, particularly the right to be assisted by a lawyer and to be able to benefit from official translations if the proceedings are in a different language.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the stage after proceedings have begun, I agree with the two specific rights selected: the right of accused people to full information about the charges brought against them, and their right to access to the case file. These are two essential conditions for determining and challenging the lawfulness of the arrest or detention and for enabling them to put up the best possible defence.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore congratulate the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs on their work during the informal trialogues. These have led to the approval of measures that will harmonise the spread and development of fundamental rights, such as the right to a defence and the right to a fair trial.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her well prepared report, because this Directive really is a huge step forward, reinforcing rights to information in criminal proceedings and common standards throughout the European Union. Indeed, simply knowing your rights is not enough, it is very important for them to be respected and to be able to exercise them in a real situation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Denial of procedural rights can have a very detrimental effect on the fairness of the criminal process and may lead to judicial errors. This Directive is therefore aimed at ensuring a fair hearing in a person’s home country or another European Union Member State. Basic procedural rights also need to be respected, such as consulting a lawyer or having interpretation and translation if needed.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is important for Member States to ensure that suspected or accused persons are provided with sufficient information about the accusations, such as the nature and cause of an accusation in order to safeguard the fairness of criminal proceedings and ensure the effective exercise of the right of defence. It is particularly important that the right to information in this Directive should not only cover rights concerning legal advice and legal aid, but should also grant rights to contact relatives, employers and consular services.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Reding, I would firstly like to say that I very much welcome the results of the work carried out by Ms Sippel in conjunction with the rapporteurs. The proposal will successfully lay down common minimum standards for the right to information in criminal proceedings within the European Union. I thought at the outset that the proposal tabled by the Commission was very good. I would therefore like to offer my particular congratulations to Commissioner Reding.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this process I was particularly concerned that the rights of the suspected person – particularly as regards the right to remain silent – should have no negative consequences, as was in fact the case in the law of certain Member States. That is now ensured. I am pleased about that, too. In the course of the discussions on this report it became clear that in many Member States there is no legal obligation to inform a suspected person of his right to legal assistance, and moreover that in only ten Member States were suspected persons informed of their rights in writing, and that in three Member States there was even no possibility whatsoever of access to documentation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Looking at France and the practice there as regards garde à vue – in which there is no access to a lawyer during the initial detention period – it is clear that we need to carry out some approximation at a European level, and that we need to do so in the near future. Only then will we be able to restore trust in other Member States’ judicial systems and ensure that mutual recognition of judgements can take place on such a basis. Unless we have achieved an adequate level of approximation we will not be able to forge ahead with measures such as the European Investigation Order.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report takes us a big step in the right direction. I congratulate all those involved.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I want to first acknowledge the efforts made by Commissioner Reding and the Commission in speeding up this package of procedural safeguards, given that it has been stalled for a long time, and could not be implemented until the Swedish Presidency established the roadmap.</p>
      <p sl="es">Clearly, a country demonstrates how civilised it is by the way it treats suspects. For that reason, we consider that the specific proposal we are debating here today is very significant. I would like to thank Birgit Sippel for her efforts in introducing some elements into this proposal for a Directive, which are substantial for the suspect, for the letter of rights, that is, to know what the suspect is accused of and to establish, therefore, the right to remain silent and the right to learn of the substantial elements of which they are accused, as well as, of course, medical care, etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, what I really want to highlight in this speech is the birth of this right, because this was the debate on the right to interpretation and translation, and this will be the debate on legal assistance for a suspect. When does this right come into being? When the suspected person is accused of something, and it is very important that this right is respected and that this right comes into force at the same time that the person becomes aware that they are a suspect.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, first of all, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Sippel, for the work she has done and for her excellent report, and also the Commissioner, Vice-President Reding, for actually proposing this directive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This new directive deals with a real issue faced by Romanian and European citizens, who, while enjoying freedom of movement within the European Union, must comply with the rules of 27 judicial systems. Greater harmonisation is needed between Member States’ judicial systems, both civil and criminal, and the first step towards this is to establish common standards for informing defendants. Often, defendants do not know either the local language or their rights under the national laws of Member States, and this can lead to abuses.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A good example is that of the Roma citizens from Romania and Bulgaria expelled from France without knowing what they were being accused of or what their rights were. The right to interpretation and translation and the right to be informed of one’s rights and obligations are fundamental and should be mandatory minimum standards in all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the right to information for suspects and defendants during criminal proceedings is one of the cornerstones which should guarantee the standards of every civilised country. In this connection, we should welcome the work that this House has put into this document. We also welcome the fact that rules of this kind, which concern fundamental rights, are covered by this directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us not forget an issue which has been ignored here, although it too deserves attention, namely the situation of victims, who are often in a similarly difficult situation and do not receive adequate information, even though they have fallen victim to crimes which are sometimes atrocious. Sometimes they fall victim to these crimes in countries they are visiting as tourists, where they are unable to move around and defend their rights and reasons because of the language barrier. We must not forget about them, and we must not create an imbalance between the rights of the victim and those of the offender. We should remember that victims often become victims of crimes again, in a phenomenon known to researchers as ‘repeat victimisation’. This is due to the callousness of the judicial system, which does not respect their right to information or their right to protection, even though these should be the priority. In some jurisdictions the offender, often having acted deliberately and in full awareness of his deeds within an organised group, has more rights than his victim. This House must be vocal in its appeals for the rights of victims.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am calling on you, Commissioner, and I would encourage you to get involved in measures to help victims, to help all those who right now are falling victim to serious crime and are later entirely ignored by the state apparatus, even in Europe. We are obliged to make changes, Commissioner. Let us do something about it.</p>

Along with the general right of a participant to be informed about procedural rights, the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council therefore also defines two specific kinds of right. The right to information about the charge and the right to access to the case file mark a major step towards a situation where criminal proceedings operate in relation to the accused at least within the basic outlines of related rules in EU countries. Compliance with common minimum standards in relation to the right to information in criminal proceedings will also allow public bodies to avoid misconduct that might later undermine confidence, as well as the correctness and legality of criminal proceedings. The submitted Directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings will surely contribute to a substantial improvement in the rights of EU citizens in criminal proceedings.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in a European Union in which the right to a fair trial and to a defence has been laid down in not one, but two instruments – firstly in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and secondly in the European Convention on Human Rights – one should be able to assume that people are informed of their rights in criminal proceedings as a matter of course. With eight million criminal trials taking place annually across Europe, the bureaucracy alone was unlikely to be able to keep up with increased mobility. However, the situation has improved considerably since the Commission became aware of the problem of EU citizens not being informed in another Member State of their basic fundamental rights in a language they can understand. In some countries the information is given only verbally; in others it is given in writing in such complex language – legalese you might call it – that unless you have a legal background you would hardly understand any of it, even in your own mother tongue. It is therefore to be welcomed if information on rights is now to be provided in the EU languages in written form and in accessible language – not just so as to save on interpreting costs, but also because this simple measure could help to prevent judicial errors, which is a good thing.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to draw attention to restrictions on rights experienced by municipalities under the current conservative and liberal coalition governing Lithuania. Due to the recession and government inaction, some municipalities are trying to provide their residents with financial assistance by themselves. Unfortunately, last week a government representative demanded that Vilnius district municipality revoke its 2009 decision under which residents’ heating costs are subsidised. This is government interference in the competence of municipalities and a gross violation of the European Charter of Local Self-Government, and unfortunately not the first one. Municipalities in my country are so far unable to use finance and land of their own accord. The use of even the smallest plot of land for municipal purposes requires explicit government permission. I would like to use this platform as an MEP to ask the Committee of the Regions and other local bodies to defend municipalities’ rights, which have been disregarded by the current Lithuanian Government.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, 2011 has ended, leaving behind a feeling of uncertainty about the future, the future of our citizens, the future of Europe and the future of the euro. Last year, the institutions of the European Union were replaced by an informal German-powered management team supported by the French. Political leaders and the media have presented the problems of Mediterranean Europe as the result of the laziness and corruption of its inhabitants. We call the Greeks lazy, but it turns out that they are the hardest-working Europeans. As a Greek, I refute these accusations, accusations that, unfortunately, by dint of constant vilification, have ripped the people apart.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, economists are people who teach us what to do with money we do not have. Everybody is talking about the crisis as though it were inevitable. There are some who even say: ‘the alternative to the crisis is war: you choose!’ Well, this is not really the case. Perhaps this reasoning was valid up to 1945, when imbalances were dealt with brutally by force, in the sense that a big scandal was covered up by an even bigger one. In the meantime, however, the European Union came into being, that organisational structure whose duty it is to avoid war and prevent or drastically limit the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, what the founding fathers of the European Union failed to take into consideration was human greed.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, last year, without the agreement of neighbouring states, Hungary unilaterally adopted a non-standard form of nationality, which is granted on the basis of ethnicity, with no real link of the citizen to the state in question. Since Hungary has rejected and continued to postpone a communication on this matter, the Slovak Republic has passed an appropriate amendment to nationality. This includes the principle of withdrawal of Slovak nationality where there is a voluntary acquisition of nationality of another state. This principle is not contrary to European standards. Quite the reverse – it is included in the European Convention on Nationality as well as in the legislation of many EU Member States. I would therefore like to recommend to Hungarian colleagues in the European Parliament that, rather than hysterical nationalistic speeches, they put pressure on the government in Budapest to begin correct negotiations over this issue with neighbouring states.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there have been serious concerns about the activities of the CENI, the electoral commission, with accusations of widespread fraud in favour of the incumbent, President Joseph Kabila, and a lot of serious violence has broken out. International observers on the ground are demanding more transparency and the publication of the results at local level, and the High Representative must insist on this if the EU is to unequivocally recognise the results.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly in Russia – parliamentary elections – there have been widespread protests at the allegations of massive fraud, again carried out in favour of Putin’s United Russia party. The scale is so large that there are grounds to believe, a bit like in Ukraine in 2005, that the outcome of the election would have been completely different. So there is also reason to demand now a re-run of these parliamentary elections in Russia, otherwise the presidential election next year will be a total farce.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, just a few weeks ago the European Commission placed the Baltic-Adriatic axis on the list of the major projects to be supported in the coming years. This north-south axis, which is nearly 2 000 km in length, links up nearly 50 million people in ten EU Member States. It covers 85 conurbations and commercial centres, 138 sea ports and internal waterways as well as 28 border crossings with third countries, and with a freight volume of around 24 million tonnes per year is one of the main Alpine crossing points. These facts make it very clear what a positive effect the Baltic-Adriatic axis will have for the countries concerned. It will bring the eastern Member States of the EU closer to the centre of Europe and provide them with better links, which will result not only in economic growth in the adjoining countries but also in a strengthening of the internal market. In addition to a further opportunity for shifting freight from road to rail, it will also dramatically cut travel times for passenger transport. This opens up new prospects for tourism, and thus offers us all a chance to get to know each other better.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on 11 October 2011 the former Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko, was found guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison. In addition, the court banned her from all public functions for a period of three years and obliged her to pay compensation to Naftohaz. Since that day, the former Prime Minister has been remanded in prison waiting for further court proceedings. On 1 December 2011, the Court of Appeals rejected Tymoshenko’s appeal, and also denied her release for health reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Subsequent court rulings show that Ukraine’s President and his advisors have decided not to respond to the European Union’s proposals regarding, inter alia, changes to criminal law and the dismissal of Tymoshenko’s case or the granting of her appeal. The guilty verdict and her remand in custody shows that domestic policy issues are more important to the Party of Regions. Keeping the former Prime Minister in prison means Ukraine is effectively isolated in the West. However, the refusal by Parliament, under the control of Yanukovych, to amend the criminal code, along with the subsequent court proceedings and the rejection of the appeal, show that the authorities have no intention of releasing the former Prime Minister, who is being held in prison under scandalous conditions, with limited access to her.</p>

Firstly, the people were not granted free elections as provided for in the constitution, because Putin’s government refused to register a number of political parties that wished to participate in the elections. Secondly, the counting of the votes on the election day was fraudulent. There are reports which say that United Russia received much less than 49.54% of the votes.</p>

Already after the enactment of the Slovakian language law and the maintenance of the Beneš decrees I proposed here in Strasbourg, in this House, that the European Union apply some form of sanctions against Slovakia. Now, Slovakia, not having been subjected to any sanctions, is continuing its rampage. And let us say it: the intention of Slovakia and the Slovakian Government is to erase the Hungarian population of almost half a million living in the historic region of Upper Hungary from the map. In order to achieve this they even go as far as withdrawing the Slovakian citizenship of one Hungarian in Upper Hungary after another. The inhumane nature of the actions of the Slovakian Government is also demonstrated by last week’s incident where a 100-year-old Hungarian teacher was deprived of her Slovakian citizenship.</p>

Investors on financial markets are afraid to lend more money to governments that increase expenditure in an irresponsible way. Failure to implement reforms has increased public sector debt. As EU Member States’ economies are interlinked, it is necessary to find the correct balance between the responsibility of states for running their affairs and solidarity, when some Member States are threatened with economic and social breakdown. The massive intervention of the European Central Bank must not, however, become a standard measure to be used by states every time they get into trouble through bad economic policies. That would have catastrophic consequences not only for Europe, but for the whole world. We must make use of the existing legal framework based on the Lisbon Treaty.

This is not surprising, given the slow speed with which the right decisions are presented and the lack of political courage and vision of the European leaders. The very concept of how to tackle the issue of financial stability is going in the wrong direction. Confidence and stability suggest quick action. There is no time to create new institutions and unclear procedures and even less to change the European Union Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The right approach is not to restrict the circle of countries who endeavour to stabilise the euro, but the opposite, to expand that circle. Countries like the United States, Japan, China and Brazil, which really have an interest in the stability of the euro currency, should be involved in this effort. The IMF is able to provide a platform for such an intervention. It should be allowed to conclude agreements to finance the countries with balance of payments problems. In parallel, the restricted use of Eurobonds, the European Stability Mechanism and the activity of the European Central Bank can provide the necessary robust financial resource which is needed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in February of this year, the European Commission published its trade and investment barriers report which highlighted its priorities for action on breaking down barriers to trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report itself provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges the EU faces as a result of the vast array of non-tariff barriers (NTBs). Despite real efforts to free up trade, our policy strategy has focused primarily on the dismantling of tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the persistence of these costly and burdensome barriers is ever present and more worrying. There is evidence to suggest that countries are resorting more and more to these kinds of protectionist tools. Only last month the trade commissioner himself warned our committee of the new wave of protectionism by our strategic partners. Our Europe 2020 trade policy strategy can only fully be realised if we systematically and constructively deal with these trade barriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report symbolises a shared commitment to move forward with a proactive and progressive trade agenda. I would like to see the Commission act proactively to remove or at the very least reduce the restrictive impact of NTBs on the capacity of European businesses accessing foreign markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission should raise the question of NTBs with all EU trading partners. The EU should also carefully review its own trade measures in order to lift all illegitimate hindrances to open and free markets and become a true forerunner in the anti-NTB fight.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is good to see Mrs Reding, the Commissioner from Luxembourg here today. I have a personal question to do with the problem of tariffs on fuel travelling across borders. We do have problems of tariffs within the European Union and therefore it is important that these should be sorted out.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission should address the NTB problem as part of its WTO agenda, within reassessment of existing WTO agreements on technical barriers to trade (TBT) and the TBT agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to free trade agreements, it is vital that these agreements provide sufficient reciprocity and market access and mutual benefits to both parties, in order to increase both the general awareness about NTBs and motivate business and public authorities into fighting against them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission should also gather information on the WTO and OECD and any other international organisation that is relevant to work done or ongoing about a possible correlation between the existence of NTBs and the resulting loss of potential market share. I would also like to see the Commission examine the possibility of developing and establishing an early warning mechanism to detect NTBs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report suggests the increased use of regulatory dialogue with key strategic partners and working more closely with the international institutions to address the use of unjustified NTBs.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have been giving special consideration to LDCs and SIDs, recognising the sensitivity that exists in these markets, including a distinction between developing economies and emerging industrial economies, such as the BRIC countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Seeing my chairman and other people here, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, my shadow rapporteurs and all members for a combined effort in making this report so important.

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I should like to bring to your attention a matter that is of particular concern to me. At the mini plenary session in Brussels we had a European Parliament debate ahead of the US-EU summit and an extra debate on the Buy American clause in the American Jobs Act, which is currently before US Congress. It was somewhat awkward, because the competent commissioner was unable to be there and there was also a change of Commission representative halfway through the debate. Earlier in the debate we had expressed the concern that, because of this, the substance of our debate would not even reach the Commission. I was then astonished to hear the Commission representative tell us at last week’s meeting of the Committee on International Trade that the Commission has not even mentioned this matter. I consider this to be an outstanding example of a very serious barrier to trade. I would be extremely grateful, Commissioner, if you could raise this matter again in the Commission; we really must do everything in our power to ensure that the Commission takes Parliament’s demands seriously.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Commission report on trade and investment barriers shows that, by 2015, 90% of world growth will be generated outside Europe. EU competitiveness and the industrial policy depend on the availability of raw materials and rare earths. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ought to be an effective tool for ensuring transparency and combating speculation on commodity markets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would stress the importance of the EU’s trade relations with the Mercosur region and India. Although EU investment in India has increased more than fourfold since 2003, India’s investment policy continues to obstruct foreign investment. Although Brazil and Argentina are important trading partners for the EU, they regularly adopt tariff and non-tariff measures that disadvantage European companies, even though they are both involved in negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I agree with the report’s author, Mr Sturdy, that the broad range of non-tariff measures used in international trade complicates relationships between individual countries and economic groupings. I firmly believe, however, that we must look for correct and fair solutions primarily at the global level, since, as the report’s author states, many of these measures, such as the technical standards and certification applying to health protection, are legitimate by nature. At the same time, however, measures are often applied that have an unambiguously protectionist nature, and we should unite to eliminate these. This is in the interests of all major economies, and a common platform for exchanging views and seeking solutions therefore offers the best chance of success.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on the drafting of his report; however, I cannot currently agree with him either from a political or from an economic standpoint. After all, non-tariff barriers are by themselves understandable, since we are in the middle of an economic crisis and countries seek to protect their own national economies. Why, it was open trade that has lead to the impoverishment of national economies in that they were unable to reduce unemployment in their own countries. This is why instead of continued efforts to create an open economy we need national sovereignty and food sovereignty. We need patriot economies that cooperate as strong economies in an economic alliance.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Furthermore, while we need to preserve the open market, we must focus on local economy and local markets when laying the new foundations on which the European economy can be rebuilt.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I would like to express my great gratitude to Mr Sturdy for presenting this issue to us with accompanying recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Certainly we are in a difficult position in the European Union right now. We have our own problems in the eurozone. Our future in terms of competing against the rest of the world and keeping up our economic situation is certainly at risk. For that reason, we have to try and ensure that everything in relation to trade is done fairly and across the board and that we are not disadvantaged.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Certainly the point about the non-tariff barriers needs to be dealt with on a global level. In essence it is protectionism and that is not what is required in the modern era. We also we have to ensure that any FTAs we engage in are worthwhile and beneficial to European competitiveness and companies, and that they are both sensible and practical. I believe that many of them in the past were not like that.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this is yet another eulogy to free trade, something all too frequent in this House. Those who usually make them want to convince us that it is only obstacles to free trade, barriers to free trade, that prevent progress and prosperity from holding sway throughout the world. The reality is very different, and the truth is that the liberalisation and deregulation of world trade has led to phenomena such as social and environmental dumping that we cannot ignore here, both because they set workforces from different areas in competition, driving down and forcing a devaluation of the workforce, and because they inevitably lead to unsustainable flows of energy and materials. However, in this case, in the eagerness to demolish each and every barrier, they even want to jeopardise measures that are in the area of public interest, giving a restrictive conception and vision of that same public interest.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that the crisis we are facing demonstrates one thing: basically, we have to question the role now played by the free market and essentially orient international trade towards complementarity and not towards competition between countries, products and producers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, on this important, opportune and highly pertinent report, which, in my view, deserves the full support of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Indeed, the European Union should give high priority to reducing unjustified and excessive non-tariff barriers to international trade and foreign investment. This is, firstly, because it is a constitutional guideline: Article 206 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union explicitly mentions the progressive dismantling of restrictions on international trade and foreign investment, including the removal of non-tariff barriers. The second reason is that it is in our interests, given that some of our most important trade partners, like Japan, China, and Russia, retain a large number of non-tariff barriers which limit the opportunities of our companies in their markets. These companies expect our support for growth and employment within the Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, non-tariff barriers which impede access for European producers and exporters on external markets must be removed. It is important that multilateral trade rules are correctly applied. Reciprocity in terms of market access for both parties in the context of bilateral free trade agreements is vital.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support the promotion of public procurement codes of conduct. European companies should be able to tender for public contracts in third countries on fair and equitable terms.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, a stable and attractive environment must be created for European investors abroad. Given the Union’s position as the world’s largest exporter of services, I would stress the need to eliminate restrictions affecting European service sectors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I would like to thank the Committee on International Trade and most of all the rapporteur Robert Sturdy for taking up the paramount issue of trade barriers, especially non-tariff barriers, which European companies encounter on third-country markets. You are very well aware that the Commission has highlighted this in its first annual trade and investment barrier report in March this year and this report goes right to the heart of the enforcement agenda of our trade policy. Your report contributed to increasing the political dimension of this matter and we thank you for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have taken good note of your suggestions, and when I say ‘we’, I speak on behalf of my colleague Karel De Gucht, of course, who is the Commissioner responsible for this file. I can assure you that the Commission will continue to pursue the removal of unjustified non-tariff barriers through regulatory cooperation with, in particular but not solely, our strategic partners. As the report rightly points out we will of course fully respect the right of our partners to establish their own levels of public policy protection in the areas of health, safety and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will mention just one example of regulatory cooperation, of which the Commission informed Parliament at the last meeting, on 29 November 2011. I am speaking about the Transatlantic Economic Council in Washington where the United States and the European Union agreed on strengthening cooperation in a number of regulatory areas; those include e-vehicles, nanotechnology, and information and computer technology.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the question of the American Jobs Act, the Commission is following this very closely and you will certainly be aware that some of the most worrying elements fortunately did not pass the US legislative process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also using our free trade agreements to address regulatory barriers. The agreement with Korea is a very good example of this approach because it contains extensive rules on sectoral regulatory issues: cars, electronics and medical devices. In the recent meeting of the Trade Committee established under the agreement, the Korean Minister and our Commissioner could achieve important progress on some of the outstanding regulatory issues related to cars. The importance of regulatory issues and the interplay between internal and external market opening will also be one of the subjects discussed at a high-level conference which the Commission is organising on 20 January in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have taken good note of your suggestions on government procurement, investment and export restrictions, all of which are very important building sites for a 21st century trade policy for the European Union. As you know very well the removal of trade barriers is and remains a top priority for our trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s next trade and investment barriers report will come out in March 2012 and it will build on the recommendations set out in your report, so the fact that this report is now on the table, Mr Sturdy, is very important. It will be an inspiration and a support for the collective work of the Commission, the Member States and Parliament.</p>
