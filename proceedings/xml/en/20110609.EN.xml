      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have a point of order under Rule 96 by prearrangement with the President, whom I would ask to write to the Formula One Teams Association – including Lotus in my own constituency – which made clear in a letter yesterday that it objected to a rearranged Bahrain Grand Prix on logistical grounds.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask the President, in that letter, to remind those teams that there is a fine tradition of sportspeople withdrawing from events on human rights grounds – from Muhammad Ali and Vietnam to cricketers refusing to go to South Africa under apartheid and athletes to the Moscow Olympics.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also ask the President to make it clear on behalf of the European Parliament that should any of the teams withdraw on human rights grounds, they would have the support of this Parliament, and that the bloodied name of Bahrain should not stand, this year, alongside the proud European names of the Nürburgring, Monza, Monaco and Silverstone.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I am rapporteur for the report on transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements after the Treaty of Lisbon and, following thorough consideration of Parliament’s vote and the Council’s proposal, I would like to step down as rapporteur for this report, as the position of both the Council and Parliament so one-sidedly favours the interests of investors and does not take account of the need for transparency. Furthermore, the old Member States are not taking into account the need of the new Member States for new agreements, and investors’ rights are not balanced in any way by environmental, social and other legal requirements. I therefore do not feel able to defend Parliament’s position, nor do I feel able to lead these negotiations to a successful outcome. I therefore ask to be allowed to transfer the task of rapporteur to the committee chair.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Mazzoni, the chair of the Committee on Petitions, who is unfortunately unable to be with us. No doubt there are more important petitions than this one. This petition does not concern thirty thousand people, as in the case for some other petitions that are pending in this House. The drivers behind this question as far as the Committee on Petitions is concerned are nature, which is a contentious matter locally, how the local economy is allowed to develop, and, above all – and I will come back to this subsequently – the uniform application of the law in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps I might make another comment before going further. The report on this case – on this ski lift project – shows that the local media delight in seeing someone or other on the ground. It could be a lobbyist for nature, a lobbyist for business, the local authorities or the national government. That is not appropriate in this case. We went on a local fact-finding mission – Mrs Lichtenberger accompanied me – and the impression that the European Union can act as some kind of supreme court of appeal is entirely misplaced.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to rely to some extent on local authorities implementing the law properly. This takes us to what is at the heart of the petition. The petitioners assert that the local threshold for carrying out an environmental impact assessment (EIA), which was 20 hectares at the time, was not adhered to; that instead, the project was artificially subdivided into smaller parts and that in reality, the 20 hectare threshold was exceeded. As an aside, a 10 hectare threshold has since been introduced in Austria. Things have therefore changed somewhat in any case.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we investigated locally, we concluded that the provisions concerning environmental impact assessments, as applicable in Austria, were complied with at the time – at least in essence. One might argue over the odd square metre or other measurement, but in our view, the dispute does not concern vast areas. Neither do we feel that consideration of individual aspects of the development would obviously lead to a different conclusion. This applies, for example, to the issue of the lake created to provide water for artificial snow, the issue of parking facilities serving the project and other aspects.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we came to the view that we needed to look a little more into what was behind this case. We questioned whether the way the national government had applied the law on the EIA was correct and in accordance with the spirit of our European regulations. We then soon saw that to some extent, it was possible for the provisions to be applied in different ways – not just in Austria, but also in some other Member States, including my own country.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question arises as to whether we should always allow projects to be sliced up locally. The question arises as to whether we should allow projects to be divided into separate stages in time, if, in retrospect, one can say that actually it was all part of an overall plan and should have been looked at as a whole from the start. There are also cases of projects being subdivided locally as far as their legal arrangement is concerned, which gives rise to the question of how much this is permitted by our European legislation – deliberately or otherwise – and whether things need to be tightened up in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">One particular point stood out for us in respect of such facilities. Can we really allow ski runs – new ski areas of 1, 2, 3 or 10 hectares which are added on to ski areas or which will be more heavily trafficked as a result of the expansion of existing ski facilities – to be completely disregarded in the calculations? My personal opinion is that, based on the European rules, all the areas to be used should be included in the overall project, hence our specific question to the Commission as to whether it does not feel that we need to tighten up the European regulations in this area.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, Mr Potočnik and I are pleased that we have a parliament that has made the monitoring of environmental regulations a focal area of its work, as is the case in this instance. The EIA Directive is of great value for the ecological development of the European Union. For us, it is an important instrument for achieving sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="de">It states that projects that have a substantial impact on the environment must undergo an assessment in which all their direct, but also indirect, effects on the environment are evaluated. These are types of projects in which the Member States have to decide, using threshold values, whether the results of this assessment mean that an EIA must be carried out. The circumstances in your ski area belong to a class of projects in which Member States have long had to decide whether an EIA is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Austrian legal provision was not really satisfactory in the past. It concerned an area of 10 hectares or of 20 hectares or more. After we received the petition, the Commission asked the Austrian Government how it had ensured that the directive was properly applied in this project. Austria replied that it had not had to carry out an EIA because the threshold of 20 hectares had not been reached. There was then official doubt on our part. We pointed out that in determining the size of the area, and thus deciding on whether an EIA was necessary, an overall view should be taken rather than looking at the area in its narrower sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">Austria then revised its law on EIAs, which I think is the most important result in this individual case. In our legal opinion, it now complies in every respect with the requirements of the European EIA Directive. The decision as to whether an EIA is necessary when a ski area is expanded now depends overall on the size of the enlargement in land area and whether it lies within a designated nature conservation area. Moreover, earlier expansions are also now to be included in the appraisal.</p>
      <p sl="de">The requirements of the EIA Directive are actually clearly and strictly stated in this respect. Circumventing these merely by subdividing projects into stages, into sections or tranches, is not possible. We place great importance on an overall analysis of the impact on nature. The European Court of Justice has confirmed our interpretation of the law. It has made it clear on more than one occasion that the aims of the EIA Directive cannot be circumvented by subdividing projects. As far as the threshold area is concerned, taking into consideration only those surfaces on which building work is actually to be carried out is too narrow. We are concerned not just with the building work, but also with its overall integration into the surrounding area. In other words, when calculating whether the threshold area is reached, one must include areas in which no building works are actually taking place, but which are indisputably part of the project and part of the impact of the project.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why we feel that screening should have been carried out in the Damüls-Mellau ski area before the expansion took place in order to establish whether an EIA was necessary for the project. This decision should also have been made public, giving the reasons behind it. These are the obligations with which the Austrian authorities did not comply. They failed to carry out such screening, which, in our view, was a requirement.</p>
      <p sl="de">The project is in the past; it was decided on five years ago and approved five years ago. Construction is already complete. We have therefore requested further details of the effects of the works from the authorities in Vienna and have also made enquiries as to whether measures to alleviate the consequences are necessary and can still be considered. Once we have received this information, we will examine whether further steps can be taken to alleviate the effects on nature in this area as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have also asked the authorities in Austria to confirm to us that in the event of the future expansion of this or other ski areas which met the criteria under the old version of the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments, screening will first be carried out to ascertain whether an EIA is necessary. Mr Potočnik is currently working on a revision of the EIA Directive. Both he and we intend to submit a new text that further enhances environmental protection, which especially takes into consideration the areas of climate change, energy and biodiversity, which also includes relevant important rulings by the European Court of Justice and which harmonises and simplifies the existing procedures as far as possible and, moreover, excludes circumvention more clearly than previously.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Potočnik is in the process of preparing the recast of this directive and has therefore consulted broadly with the public and the relevant interest groups over the past year. The results are currently being evaluated and we will table a proposal accordingly in 2012 at the latest. The improper execution of this construction work will at least have a positive effect for the future, because European law will be worded more clearly and will no longer be so easy to circumvent. We are pleased that the Austrian act on the EIA now complies with the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission will take action to ensure that the Austrian authorities look at the environmental impact of the work that has already been carried out in order to ensure that in any future expansion of the ski area in the region around Damüls-Mellau, the requirements of our directive are applied in accordance with the rules. In other words, we have all learnt from the mistakes made in this individual case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Wieland has already outlined the facts of the case very clearly. I would like to add one or two political assessments, if I may.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the fact that existing regulations or directives are examined to see how well they are working in practice or how well they are achieving their objectives and are then improved or interpreted more precisely where necessary is not an argument against European policy, but rather an argument in favour of such policy. There will always be competition between European regulations and directives and the form that these take at local level. The Committee on Petitions may not be a court of appeal, but in my own understanding of what we are doing in the Committee – in other words, what I understand as my role as a member of the Committee on Petitions – I am rather proud that this petition, in which we saw that things were being interpreted differently at local level than was our intention at European level, together with the opinion of the Committee on Petitions, ultimately resulted in the law being changed in a Member State. I consider that to be a great success, and a success of European policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The general problem as I see it is the question that I will now put to the Commissioner. Many citizens are concerned about how European law on the environment is being implemented in the Member States. There are many petitions on this. Many of these are concerned with cross-border matters, but there are also many concerning circumstances in the Member States. Time and again, we face the problem that when we make enquiries to the Commission while matters are in progress, we get the answer: ‘We assume that Member State X is implementing and applying the existing directives and regulations of the European Union appropriately. We see no need to intervene’. We need an instrument that we can use to enter into a serious dialogue with the Member States while matters are in progress if there are indications that something is going wrong, so that we do not end up in the same situation as in this case. Things did not go optimally, but it is done now and we have a solution for the future – but not, unfortunately, for the past.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I think we can describe what happened here as a lesson from which we have learnt. We Austrians are very keen skiers. For that, of course, you need ski runs. However, as we must be aware and must take into consideration, a beautiful, intact environment is also a part of skiing, and people will not go skiing where this no longer exists.</p>
      <p sl="de">Seen in the light of this situation, Austrian policy has made many mistakes in the past. Ski runs have been added unilaterally without considering whether more runs are actually a good idea, and administrative practice and the legal situation were also characterised by this mindset. What happened here demonstrates the value added by the European Union and the European Parliament. In this case, it seems that things went wrong. In many cases when things go wrong, nothing happens. In this case, however, a petition was tabled, people reacted accordingly and Austria put its house in order. As far as I am concerned, it provides a good example of what should happen.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I am very grateful for the information you have given. I consider what you have said to be very important. I have just one supplementary question. You said that the Commission is entirely satisfied with the way that Austria is now implementing environmental impact assessments. However, there still remains a ruling by the European Court of Justice stating that citizens must be involved in the procedure for establishing whether an EIA is required. This has not been incorporated into the revised Austrian act and it could act as a kind of early warning system to ensure that what we saw in Mellau cannot happen again.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to emphasise once more that I think it somewhat absurd if ski runs are not included in the size of a ski area just because the entire mountain has not been dug up. As I see it, those are ultimately the areas concerned and they must be included. It is quite clear that this is a case in which a project was subdivided into smaller parts for the purposes of circumvention. I hope that you will bear this case in mind in future proceedings.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, we have a case that can help us resolve an issue that the Commission has, in fact, acknowledged, that has also been raised by Mr Jahr, and that we are going to include in the annual report that will be presented by the Committee on Petitions in the discussions regarding 2010.</p>
      <p sl="es">The situation is as follows, and we have the example of Damüls in the Alps, and also that of the Pyrenees: it is often the case that the time taken from the moment a complaint is made by some European citizens until it is resolved can be too long to resolve the issue without irreversible damage resulting. I am referring to the ability that many Member States have to evade the European directive requiring an environmental impact assessment for public or private projects in very sensitive areas in the European ecosystem, such as the Alps in this case, or it could be the Pyrenees in Spain. In this case, a project has been split up and divided to evade the directive, thus preventing any environmental impact assessment from being performed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, if you really accept that environmental impact assessments need to be strictly implemented, I think you have to react more quickly to stop projects going ahead despite reports that indicate that these projects need a prior environmental impact assessment. Therefore, it is very important for us to change the time a complaint takes to be resolved and for the Committee on Petitions and the European Commission to work to shorten those times so that Member States do not evade the need to implement the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. It has been evaded in many Member States, as has already been mentioned here, not just in Austria. In my country, Spain, we now have a project pending in the Pyrenees. It is also a ski resort, in the Castanesa valley, and the Spanish state is going to do the same. In this case, the responsible authorities in Aragon are going to split the project up in order to prevent the environmental impact assessment from taking place.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that in both the European Parliament and in the European Commission, we have to work to speed up the procedure.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-017-000" speaker_id="97016" name="Angelika Werthmann" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the environmental impact assessment is, in accordance with the precautionary principle, to determine and assess the direct impact of projects on the environment, but also their indirect effects. Excluding planned development that is clearly linked to the project in geographical or other terms can only undermine the legal situation. The European Court of Justice ruled back in 1996 that Member States must ensure that the aim of the directive cannot be circumvented by subdividing projects.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its 2003 report on the application and effectiveness of the EIA Directive, the Commission found that the roots of the multiple problems that were hindering the effectiveness of the EIA provisions lay not necessarily in the implementation of the directive at national level, but rather in its practical application. One of the recommendations formulated at the time was aimed specifically at those Member States, such as Austria, that had established binding thresholds. It was recommended that where projects might possibly have a considerable environmental impact, appropriate screening should be carried out – particularly as regards sensitive areas and the possible cumulative impact of projects. You mentioned the screening process in your introduction; we are awaiting the results.</p>
      <p sl="de">Austria’s citizens are increasingly protesting that too little consideration is given to their concerns. The European Court of Justice has ruled that the individual act at national level must be sufficiently detailed and provide for adequate public participation. What is the Commission’s assessment of this aspect in the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments?</p>
      <p sl="de">Criticism of the lack of public participation is something that can be heard in nearly all the Member States. The current revision of the EIA Directive should also include a debate on a review of the uniform procedure for public participation which is actually laid down in the directive.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-018-000" speaker_id="28252" name="Richard Seeber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, looking at the list of speakers, one might get the impression that the Community and also the Committee on Petitions is seen as some kind of supreme court in this process. I would also like to say that these projects are not something from which we should be scoring political points.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are talking here about a project in Damüls-Mellau. These are two small communities. The provincial government in Vorarlberg and the local administration tried to apply this Austrian law on the environment to the best of their ability. I believe that there is no reason to reproach these authorities. The legal question arises, however, as to how the Republic of Austria has transposed the EIA Directive. Here, one must bear in mind that the legal traditions in Austria and also in the European Union vary widely. I must point out to my fellow Member that I believe that Austria tried to do things properly. In the course of this process, lawyers came to the opinion that a few mistakes may have been made. I would like to emphasise once again that we are talking about just the last couple of percent here. In this project, measures have been taken voluntarily to compensate for this, which seems to have been forgotten. Substantial payments have been made. That must also be stated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we should probably also carry out a political appraisal. Bearing in mind that compensatory measures have been carried out in this project, that an attempt has been made to put right any wrongdoing that may have taken place, then surely the project can be rubber-stamped. Regrettably, at this juncture I must ask the Commission to treat everyone equally and to look outside our borders at some cases in other Member States where much greater damage is actually being done to natural resources. The Commission should, however, proceed with a certain amount of circumspection here. Such circumspection is particularly important in the area of environmental policy if it is to gain wider acceptance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise the aspect mentioned by the Commissioner that ‘the national authorities have learnt from this’, because I believe that the way the Austrian national government – and specifically the environment minister responsible – has proceeded with the amendment of the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments is to be seen as very positive and could be used as an example, as a benchmark, for many other cases with which many people are not as familiar.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, however, I would like to give my support to the amended petition by Mr Jahr which calls for specific and effective tools to allow influence, monitoring and correction as far back as the planning and early stages of such projects.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I have some very brief observations which arise from this process. Notwithstanding its positive aspects, the experience of the practical application of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure also shows us that it can and should be improved. It is important to look at analysis of projects’ cumulative impact in a different way, whether they are of the same type or are all different. Too often, we cannot see the woods for the trees. It is important to learn in a more complete way about the major and cumulative impact human activity has on nature.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Also, the post-EIA stage should merit closer attention: it is frequently neglected. It is important to assess the extent to which predicted impacts are realised, how effective minimisation or compensation measures are, if there are any, and the extent to which they are or are not implemented. Public environment authorities have a key role to play here and should be properly equipped to put it into effect.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, the transparency of the procedure, and public participation and scrutiny thereof, are of crucial importance to ensuring, as far as possible, the transparency, quality and independence of the study.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, today we are debating very specific issues about a specific country, but environmental impact assessments are still a rather complicated and difficult matter, both at national and international levels. Probably the greatest problem is a crisis of confidence in society over the environmental impact assessment examinations carried out, that is, the fact that project operators carry out the examinations, etc. The public should therefore be more actively involved in this process but, of course, we need to strike a balance, so that projects are not stopped without justification. Another problem is the concept of post-project assessment, when certain things, including environmental impact analysis, are not mentioned and some side effects emerge later.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Yesterday, we voted in favour of the principle of independence in the impact assessment system. This should also naturally be applied in environmental law, and when reviewing the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, we should focus on precisely this issue.</p>

I believe that it is important for the rules that are currently in force to be followed.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, this discussion once again highlights the fact that with regard to the whole area of the environment, we have a major communication problem. The environment, the economy and regional interests are constantly being played off against one another. This is where the big problem lies. We need support from the Commission to ensure that the environment is seen as an essential aspect of the economy. At the moment, far too little emphasis is being put on the fact that measures to protect the environment and the natural world can also create and safeguard jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Currently, the discussion is always polarised: either nature or jobs. We politicians have, unfortunately, also used this type of argument. I am calling on everyone to work on raising awareness and to acknowledge on both sides that we need to preserve the environment in order for the economy to continue functioning effectively in future.</p>

Under the current regulations, ski pistes only have to be included in the calculation of the thresholds when structural changes are planned during the development of the facility. All the other areas used by skiers, fare dodgers or other people do not come into consideration. I am of the opinion that the effects of using an area which has not been left in its natural state should be included.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final, brief point: in one area of a Member State which we, Mr Oettinger, are both very familiar with, the Committee on Petitions has the option in selected cases to apply a blocking procedure. I believe it would be a good thing for us to agree with the Commission and the Council that it is possible to put a freeze on proceedings if this is handled responsibly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to make one thing quite clear and to contradict the impression that has been given. The natural world is not the property of the conservation organisations. Nature is there to be used by the people. Therefore, as has just been touched on, I am not of the opinion that Damüls-Mellau is a case where this blocking procedure should have been applied.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, firstly, it must be clear to all of us that this case has not been handled correctly. However, the reappraisal of the case will help us to make progress within Europe. We have established that the thresholds were incorrectly applied, that no screening process was carried out and, therefore, that the environmental impact has not been assessed objectively enough.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act in Austria needs to be amended or expanded to ensure that it corresponds with the European Union directives, in other words, with your requirements. Thirdly, we believe it is important that, when other measures are taken in this region, whether these are additional car parks or other developments, a special screening of the entire project is carried out which includes existing developed areas and existing building projects. You could say that the region is now under closer scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="de">Anyone who enjoys skiing, as I do, will know that at around 15:00 in the afternoon in this region, noise pollution seems to be a bigger problem than damage to the natural environment. Of course, I do not mean that entirely seriously. The Commission now has the option of initiating an infringement procedure. We are not threatening to do this, but the option remains open to us. Then we need to look in general terms at the revision of the EIA Directive. What does Mr Potočnik have in mind?</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, this is all about incorporating new policy objectives, such as climate change, biodiversity, energy, trans-European networks and cohesion policy. Secondly, the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which have resulted in an important clarification of the issue, must be included. In answer to Mr Lichtenberger’s question, I would like to say that we have established that Austria’s EIA Act now meets the threshold requirements. We are currently evaluating whether it is satisfactory in terms of transparency, civic participation and public consultation, both in form and in substance. I can confirm that Mr Potočnik, the Commissioner for the Environment, will provide you with a comprehensive written answer during the next few weeks about whether it corresponds with the transparency and civic participation requirements of our directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that this case and other findings will enable us to produce a satisfactory revision of the European directive next year. Mr Wieland asked how the definition of the area should be regarded. We will give you a written answer on this issue. I believe that when a transport facility is built, we should include not only the area of land under the cable, in other words, not just the route of the lift, which is one metre wide and several thousand metres long. On the other hand, the entire mountain should not be covered, although the fare dodgers are often the best skiers if they are on the black runs. However, from a more detailed perspective, all the areas designated as pistes must be included. In other words, any managed pistes and areas where snow making machines are used, in my opinion, belong to the developed area of the mountain and, therefore, have to fall within the threshold. If necessary, this should be clearly defined during the revision of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">How could we have influenced the process at an earlier stage? These discussions are, of course, taking place relatively late in the day, five years after permission to build was granted. This is a fundamental problem because, under the terms of the Treaty, subsidiarity applies and the responsibility for implementing European law lies primarily with the Member States, which have to administer and enforce the law locally. I hope that in Austria in particular, lessons will have been learnt from this case about taking a sensitive approach when weighing up the interests of the economy and the environment and, therefore, that the case will have a positive impact in future.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Erminia Mazzoni and Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on misleading business directories (Ο-000087/2011 – Β7-0315/2011).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, two and a half years ago, I presented to this plenary a report on misleading business directories. The message that this Parliament gave was clear: that there is a serious problem with fraudulent practices by misleading business directories, that tens of thousands of our small businesses, voluntary organisations, and even charities, are falling victim to these fraudulent practices, and that we need a concerted approach to stop once and for all such deceptive practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two and a half years later, unfortunately, we are back here in plenary to discuss the same subject because there has been a serious lack of action to combat the problem of misleading business directories. This is not acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind colleagues what we are talking about here. Basically, what this involves is that a misleading business directory sends out a form, which appears to simply request people to update their own personal details or their business details, in return for what appears to be a free entry, a free listing in the business directory. At first glance, one does not notice any cost, any payment that might result from filling in this form. However, after submitting the form, victims receive a letter demanding payment of EUR 1 000 per year for three consecutive years. If they do not pay, the misleading business directories resort to what are essentially bullying tactics: harassing telephone calls, threats of legal action and pursuit by debt collectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The most worrying thing is that such illegal tactics are being used under the very noses of the authorities of several Member States, who are well aware of these practices and have not taken any action to stop them. The European City Guide, Construct Data, TEMDI, EU Business Services, World Business Directory, Expo Guide and DAD are still operating unabated. The Commission has already stated that such misleading practices are against EU law, but it has not done enough to stop them. This is why we are here today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the volume of complaints regarding misleading directory companies shows that this is a serious problem for SMEs. Rogue business directory companies are both inflicting financial damage and harassing small companies. In the period from 2003 to mid-2008, nearly 14 000 complaints and enquiries were documented. Hundreds of letters of complaint are still being received from new victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">The difficulties involved in tracking down activities of this nature undermine the very functioning of the Internal Market. Misleading practices are illegal under the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there is a lack of effective legal remedies and enforcement. The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, as the committee responsible for the legislation, has recently taken up this issue with the Dutch authorities, drawing their attention to fraudulent practices by a business directory company established in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="en">The answer of the Dutch authorities clearly shows that Member States are mostly concerned about what happens in their own territory. I believe that given the cross-border nature of the problem, more cooperation between Member States on enforcement would also be absolutely crucial to stop the fraudulent practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission could itself take a more active role in working together with the Member States on cross-border enforcement using existing EU-wide networks to facilitate cooperation between the Member States. More emphasis should be placed on effective and dissuasive sanctions against such fraudulent practices in all Member States, which would put such directory companies out of business and enable those who run them to be punished.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should be envisaged to extend the scope for the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive to encompass all commercial practices in a business-to-consumer relationship, whether aiming at the protection of consumers or competitors. In that way, most if not all unfair business-to-business commercial practices in the retail sector would be covered and governed by the same set of rules as unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices, with which they generally overlap.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important to help businesses combat the scam by improving access to information and awareness raising by improving redress mechanisms. I wish to ask the Commissioner: what are the major obstacles for stronger involvement of state authorities in cross-border enforcement cooperation, and what measures does the Commission envisage in the fight against rogue directory companies?</p>

    <intervention id="4-035-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concerns and misgivings and its critical analysis of this issue. The misleading practices of business directories are causing problems for numerous companies. Three years ago, we commissioned a survey and received thousands of complaints. We can only assume that this is just the tip of the iceberg, which means that the number of businesses that feel they have been misled could be many times greater.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Reding, the Commissioner responsible for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, is currently collecting data in order to establish the scope of the problem. I want to emphasise the fact that practices of this kind are already banned under the terms of Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and of anti-fraud legislation in the various Member States. However, some of these fraudulent practices take place across national borders and are used in business transactions between different companies and, as things currently stand, it is difficult to prosecute the perpetrators.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to address and resolve this problem, Mrs Reding plans to issue a communication by the end of the year which will report on the status of the implementation of the existing directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising and on the current opportunities for revising it and which will provide an evaluation of the situation. She is considering improving the content and looking at the conclusions to be drawn from misleading practices. She is also focusing on how the cooperation between the national authorities on the prosecution of cross-border cases can be improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">She also plans to propose that citizens and companies should be made more aware of the growing problem of misleading business directories and to highlight the need for more public relations activities in this area. The 2006 directive has been implemented by all the Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission has asked the Member States to inform us about the implementation and the measures they have taken and to submit a status report as soon as possible, before the planned communication is issued. This process was supported by a conference organised at the end of May by the Commission involving national authorities, interest groups and independent experts. The conference focused on the fraudulent practices of business directories and, in particular, cross-border activities.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the debate, it became clear that better and more systematic cooperation between the authorities in the Member States is needed and this will be incorporated into Mrs Reding’s communication at the end of the year. I can assure you that we see this issue as being just as urgent as you do. This is why we want to take the next steps as quickly as possible. However, for formal reasons, we must ensure that those businesses which are affected are involved in an appropriate way and, therefore, we need the time to do this. On the basis of the results of the consultation process and after examining all the arguments, the Commission intends to take further corrective measures to prevent misleading and illegal cross-border practices. Thank you very much for your broad support on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, no one could disagree with what you have said. I wish to relate the trouble suffered by a fellow Greek, who complained to me about a similar misadventure as the result of misleading advertising and gave me all the relevant documents. It says at the top of the letter sent out by the misleading company that the information is free of charge. Seeing that he had to enter certain information, my fellow countryman entered the information and sent off the letter. In tiny print at the bottom of the letter, it said, as Mr Busuttil said earlier, that he had to pay EUR 1 000 a year. Some time after that, the alleged legal department of the company sent out letters, which I have here, asking my fellow countryman to pay EUR 3 529.38, which apparently included interest and the company’s legal costs.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, obviously, there is a legislative framework. However, we do not know if these directives are being applied and have been adequately transposed by the Member States. The Stockholm programme says that we need to address these issues directly. We stand next to our fellow citizens; we are involved in their day-to-day problems. Our fellow citizens need to understand that we are not in some far off place, that we do not deal only with major European issues. We are with them in their day-to-day lives. We need to resolve this issue immediately.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, it is clear, first and foremost, that these companies are not only misleading, but are also fraudulent.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Entrepreneurship is meaningful insofar as it contributes to society as a whole, but if someone engages in pseudo-business in order to lure other, honest traders and companies to a directory purely for the sake of their own enrichment, and in doing so uses subterfuge, this is downright fraud, no matter how much they protest that they are not doing anything illegal. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that these directory company practices clearly are outside the law according to the directive on misleading and comparative advertising.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Nevertheless, there is no need to introduce new legislation. Rather, we should be concentrating on applying the law in practice as quickly and effectively as possible. The problem is that these companies often swoop on undertakings in another EU Member State, and these frequently small family businesses either do not have the knowledge or the ability to put up a legal defence, or find that it will cost them a lot of money and effort. I have only one additional question: does the Commission believe there is scope for a public campaign to name the individual companies involved and call on honest business not to associate with them?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would say to the Commissioner that over the last number of years, I have met many Irish citizens who have been victims of misleading business directory companies.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, I met a school secretary who paid over EUR 2 000 because the school could not afford to pay it as she felt responsible because she had signed the form. She also felt very foolish. She thought nobody could be so stupid as to do what she had done, not realising of course that this happens to people all the time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I met an elderly lady whose husband was a taxi driver. She received a form on which there were some errors. She merely thought she was correcting the errors, sent the form back and subsequently received threatening letters for two years. She was terrorised by those letters to the extent that she was afraid to open the letter when it arrived at her door. I could not tell her not to pay the money. All I could say was that if I were in her position, I would not pay the money. That was the best advice I could give her.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are lots of other examples, which I know you have heard. The truth is that citizens expect to be protected by European legislation and they cannot understand why European legislation does not protect them in this respect. There is an ambiguity here. As I said, I tell citizens that I believe that they are protected, but I cannot guarantee it. It is my understanding, for example, that one of these companies was convicted in one region of Spain, and yet all it did was simply move to another region and continue its work.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the matters that concerns citizens is that they are not sure of how legal systems operate in other countries. They may feel that within their own Member State they will be protected, but they are not sure what happens in another Member State. Equally, if these companies move outside the EU, they also have concerns about that.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is good to hear, therefore, that the Commission shares our concern and that it is pushing for cooperation between Member States and again looking at cross-border cases and trying to inform citizens and companies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, you said the situation was urgent, but it has been urgent for a very, very long time. Citizens see many areas where EU legislation impacts on their lives, and so they cannot understand why they are not protected from fraudulent companies. I would ask you, Commissioner, to understand that the word ‘urgent’ means ‘now’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I absolutely agree with what Mrs Harkin has just said. In my constituency in Scotland, it is the elderly and people who run bed-and-breakfast establishments or self-catering holiday cottages that fall foul of this criminal activity. They enter addresses into this directory and then receive a bill for a thousand euro. The elderly are terrified when they get these threatening letters from the supposedly legal representatives of these companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a cross-border criminal activity. These companies give their identities and they give their addresses. We have to track them down, close them down, prosecute them and protect the citizens of the European Union. When any member of the public contacts me in my constituency, I simply say to them to write back to the company and tell it to send all future correspondence to me. They never hear another thing.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this motion is badly needed. Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should. The companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations, and I find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises, often with limited budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers, they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people, but I think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true, then most probably it is. These companies are like predatory sharks and they should be stopped.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I know the European City Guide best and, in spite of attempts to close it down, this menace continues. In the UK in May 2008, the Misleading Marketing Regulations came into force. They outlaw using the small print of any document to hide the true cost of a service. So the Office of Fair Trading can now take action against UK companies, but there is a serious drawback.</p>
      <p sl="en">The OFT does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere, including from other Member States, so the problem continues and I continue to receive my share of complaints. More to the point, while they may operate elsewhere due to lax policing, why can my own government not prevent what comes from mainland Europe? The answer to that lies at the heart of this useless EU, which has demolished national frontiers. The free movement of people, goods and services provides perfect cover for the people traffickers, the terrorists and for threatening, traumatising scams aimed at fleecing the unwary.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can summarise in figures the situation regarding misleading business directories that are supposed to be free. Four hundred petitions have been sent to the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions. Fifty thousand very small businesses, associations or organisations have been affected and harassed into paying. An average of EUR 1 000 is required to be paid over three years for unwanted contracts, as Mr Busuttil has already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These figures only partly reflect the suffering of the victims of these scams. These people are already taking risks by starting up their company, and quickly have to face the challenges of business, the economic crisis and the uncertainties of the future. We must prevent them from being subjected to these fraudulent practices, which they do not have the financial or human resources to resist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Several proposals are possible: firstly, we must put a stop to these scams that are weakening our economy. To do so, Commissioner, it would be advisable to speed up the revision of the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive, in light of the fact that fraudulent advertising is increasing and becoming more sophisticated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should then create a blacklist of these companies, serving as a reference based on the principle of ‘naming and shaming’. With help from the national authorities responsible for fighting fraud and from the affected businesses, we could have a simple and effective tool for deterrence and prevention. Finally, we must severely punish those involved in this system. The penalties and fines incurred are often lower than the amounts collected in these scams. We should encourage Member States to be stricter in this area.</p>

This is very nice, but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area. We have Mr Busuttil’s report in front of us. In the last parliamentary term, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection repeatedly highlighted the fact that we finally need to do something to help people. The problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many of the small voluntary organisations that are affected do not have the financial means or the chutzpah to defend themselves. Only last week I received another letter asking: ‘How can I defend myself? I do not have the money for a lawyer, so I cannot take legal proceedings’. I believe that we must finally give the citizens of Europe an effective means of ridding themselves of this problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, dodgy scams, which are fraudulent in nature and prey on small businesses using a veil of legitimacy – often with Europe in their titles – must be made illegal. These scams do not just damage small businesses, which are threatened, harassed and bullied into paying fees for something they believed to be free; they damage the European Union when we do not take firm action to help.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the mantra of the European Commission, after all, to ‘think small first’, yet I have been raising this issue, as many colleagues have said, for many, many years, and yet no direct action has been taken: why not? We hear about surveys, information gatherings, and stakeholder meetings. We need action not words, and if we say that we will only wait to the end of this year, or give it another few years, then that is just too little too late: we must act now.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, given the nature of these scams and their EU-wide and cross-border nature, will the Commission consider introducing a form of legal aid to assist SMEs in tackling these scams? These types of scams will continue until the Commission takes tough action.</p>

While paying these outrageous fees may put innocent companies under severe financial hardship, the victims are often too small to afford the legal costs of bringing actions against these directory companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">These companies often target victims that are based in another Member State. This creates legal uncertainty for the victims, as they often do not know what the legal status is of such contracts in another country. The directory companies play on that uncertainty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst the Commission has clearly stated that the directive on misleading and comparative advertising outlaws the misleading practices of these directory companies, it must also look at the transposing of that directive by the Member States in order to clarify whether citizens are protected equally across Europe.

Despite the fact that, as I understand it, it was asked to cease trading by the high court in Catalonia in 2001 and was found to be guilty of misleading practices in the Belgian courts and by the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading, it continues to trade. This is not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very important that we do two things: firstly, we have to try and raise awareness amongst businesses right across Europe to ensure they are vigilant and do not fall foul of these misleading companies and, secondly, we have to bring in legislation that ensures that, when they are taken to court, they either cease trading or are put behind bars.

Conversely, there have been many instances of absurd judgments based on the formalistic approach taken by judicial and other supervisory bodies.</p>
      <p sl="cs">What these swindlers mostly rely on, however, is the poor level of legal knowledge among the institutions responsible and, regrettably, their lack of willingness and courage in many cases, and a certain indolence. Their formalistic interpretation of the law allows them to avoid getting involved, to avoid prosecuting these cases, and to wash their hands of them. Paradoxically, it is then the swindlers’ interests that are protected rather than their victims.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The question put to the Commission rightly asks how the Member States approach this issue. How have they applied the directive on misleading and comparative advertising? Unless the state plays an active and not just a formal role, this problem will remain truly intractable and the petitions from defrauded victims will accumulate. And yet we are not powerless in this matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) strongly supports the move to free small and medium-sized businesses from the menace of business directories, which allegedly provide a service for these companies, but which ultimately do not have any real consequences except invoices. However, as you, Mr Oettinger, have rightly said, Directive 2006/114/EC provides a legal basis for this which has obviously not been successfully implemented in some Member States. Therefore, I hope that the Commission will tackle the root of the problem and take a systematic approach to resolving it as quickly as possible in the Member States where the situation is particularly bad. Of course, because of the cross-border nature of the entries, the problem can spill over from these Member States into other neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">A broad-brush approach will not work in this case because it is clear that the problem lies with certain Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, business directories are one of the most widely used sources of information about the offerings available in a particular business sector. They enjoy a high standing among European consumers thanks to their prestige. This is why misleading business directories cause harm to the people who use them. This practice can be ended by implementing the directive on misleading and comparative advertising properly. Unfortunately, not all Member States have transposed this text into their legislation. This means that the victims cannot be compensated for the harm they have suffered. Revising the directive would provide the instruments needed to combat this practice. Supplementing EU legislation with specific provisions would also limit the appearance of misleading business directories. I think that the victims of these practices must have the opportunity to have direct recourse to the justice system.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that this is really a European problem. Everyone is familiar with these cases and we are hearing stories from a number of different countries. I have a whole stack of these cases on my desk and I admit that I would have fallen for most of them. The problem is, and we have covered this on numerous occasions, we have Directive 2006/114/EC, we discussed the matter in 2008 in the Committee on Petitions, and we have held debates here in plenary, but the problem is continuing and even growing in size.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Oettinger, I heard what you said at the beginning and I have the impression that the problem has landed with you. Perhaps a new Commissioner will have a new opportunity to take action in this area. I would like to ask you to take the problem seriously. It may seem to be a small problem, but it has a serious economic impact and it affects small, medium-sized and family-run companies in particular and they form the backbone of our national economies and our society. If we do not succeed in stopping this in all the Member States and in implementing the directive uniformly and effectively throughout Europe, even greater damage will be caused.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, I am grateful for the wide-ranging and consistent description of the situation given by the committed Members who are here today. I will inform Mrs Reding about this and encourage her to draw up a comprehensive communication covering the strengths and the weaknesses of current European and national law and to revise the directive on this basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear that the 2006 directive has been implemented by the Member States. Therefore, this is not primarily a problem of adapting national law. Firstly, in the event of cross-border problems, the law is often not even applied in many cases, as a result of the less than ideal cooperation between the authorities in the different Member States, and, therefore, these cases are not investigated at all. Secondly, there is often a failure to prosecute. Criminal law is a matter for the Member States, both in terms of setting penalties and of formal investigations of these cases by the authorities, public prosecutors or the courts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, and now I am coming to the heart of the matter, the 2006 directive only covers unfair practices in business dealings between businesses and consumers and not between one business and another. This means that it mainly provides protection for private citizens against these fraudulent companies. It does not protect citizens who are entrepreneurs, sole traders, retailers, businesspeople and tradesmen or who own small or medium-sized businesses against this type of fraud. However, it is precisely this point, extending the scope of the directive to include business dealings between companies, which was opposed by the majority of the Member States during the legislative process at the time. This means that we quite deliberately restricted ourselves on the basis of this directive to European regulation of dealings between fraudulent companies and citizens and not between fraudulent companies and small businesses. European regulation of the issue which you are rightly complaining about on the basis of practical experience was not wanted at the time.</p>
      <p sl="de">The directive was an ambitious European project and, at the time, the Commission was concerned that the whole proposal would be sabotaged and that there would be no directive at all if it had insisted on extending the directive beyond the relationship between fraudsters and citizens. In the light of the specific examples you have mentioned here and the cases of abuse uncovered by the Commission, it may be possible to broaden the scope of the directive beyond the relationship between fraudulent companies and citizens in the revision which is due to take place next year. We will start work on this immediately.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, there are Member States which have satisfactory provisions under substantive and criminal law covering the relationship between fraudsters and citizens and which prosecute cases of this kind. Good examples include Austria, Belgium and France. There are other Member States, and you have referred to some of them here, where the national regulations are not adequate. We must wait and see whether these Member States will be prepared in the Council in a year’s time to vote in favour of a general, EU-wide, standardised regulation to protect citizens who are also businesspeople.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The problem is real, unfortunately very widespread and can be observed almost across the whole European Union. The victims sign a contract in good faith to be advertised in a business directory after having been led to believe that this would be free of charge. Then the operators require payment on different grounds, and continuously harass, put under psychological stress and even threaten with legal action those who do not pay up. A review as to whether the corresponding Union law is effectively implemented by Member States is inevitable in order to avoid further misleading advertising and, if necessary, a new amendment of the relevant Union law should be proposed in order to solve the current problem. The most important thing now is to demonstrate to the enterprises in trouble that we not only understand their plight but also fully support them. At the same time, it is imperative to ask misleading business directory companies to cease and desist their deliberately misleading business activities, because they are contrary to the spirit of the Union’s competition policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, following numerous meetings with various parliamentary committees, I can report to you today on the progress of our ambitious plan to introduce a Europe-wide stress test for nuclear power stations in the European Union and in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">We proposed to the Council that the safety of all the nuclear power stations in the EU should be investigated on the basis of a comprehensive risk and safety evaluation and the Council reached a decision on this at the end of March. The European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) and the Commission were asked to draw up the criteria, the methodology and the timeframe for carrying out the stress tests. This was not an easy process and we received comments of all kinds on our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can tell you today that we now have in place the test criteria, the methodology and the timeframe, which, in my opinion, will meet the expectations of European citizens with regard to this stress test.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling from Mr Turmes)"/>
      <p sl="de">Simply saying ‘Rubbish’ is not an argument, Mr Turmes. ‘Rubbish’ is not a word that we like to see in the Minutes, but if it makes you happy, then I will accept it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In any case, we had a tough struggle. Firstly, many of the nuclear safety regulators were not prepared to agree to a European inspection procedure. This is because the energy mix is a matter for the Member States and because the monitoring, authorisation and supervision of nuclear power plants also falls within the remit of the Member States. I believe that the fact that we are carrying out a stress test at a European level with joint criteria is an extremely important and historic step forwards in the interest of the safety of all European citizens. I can assure you that I will not allow a watered-down version of the stress test to be used.</p>
      <p sl="de">When the outcome of the stress test is presented to the public, with all the results, evaluations, proposals and conclusions, the citizens of Europe will know more about European nuclear power stations in all the Member States than they have done despite all the efforts made over past decades. I remember very well how people living in areas close to national borders wanted to find out about the safety features of nearby nuclear power stations. This was often very unsatisfactory from the perspective of the citizens. In six or nine months, we will have significantly more data, facts and findings at our disposal than have been made public over the last twenty years.</p>
      <p sl="de">The stress test consists of three stages.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling from Mrs Harms)"/>
      <p sl="de">Given the early hour, let us take a serious approach this morning, Mrs Harms. Please trust me to remain objective. When we discuss this subject, I feel as if I am being criticised by both sides. As the worldly-wise person in the middle, I know I am in the right place.</p>
      <p sl="de">I said ‘in the middle’, Mrs Harms. I did not say anything about mediocrity. Please listen carefully. I believe that my position will meet your expectations when it comes to objectivity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Stage 1: In a market economy, the main responsibility of the owners and operators of industrial plants is undoubtedly to ensure themselves that their facilities are safe, to carry out regular safety inspections and to report the results. For this reason, during the first stage, every operator of a nuclear power plant has been asked since 1 June to submit a report to the national authorities using the agreed European inspection criteria, our inspection catalogue, which is public and transparent. The reports must be submitted quickly, but they must be thorough, and thoroughness is more important than speed. They must include the operators’ evaluation of their own nuclear power plant and the conclusions drawn by the operators on the basis of the inspection criteria and the consequences of Fukushima.</p>
      <p sl="de">Stage 2: This consists of another review by the national nuclear safety regulators of the reports produced by the operators and an evaluation of the regulators’ own inspections and findings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Stage 3 is new and is made up of peer reviews. During the third stage, we intend to gain our own picture of the situation, make our own evaluation and draw our own conclusions at a European level. We will not be sitting in our ivory tower and we will not be naively accepting the results provided by the national authorities. We will be using mixed European teams and we will have the option of visiting the nuclear power plants ourselves. The European teams will be made up of nuclear experts from the various Member States and Commission officials.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every step, in particular, in the context of the peer reviews, can only be taken on the basis of agreement between the Commission and ENSREG, which means that without the Commission’s agreement, the process cannot be completed. This is why I can assure you that a serious, objective and thorough approach is very important to me.</p>
      <p sl="de">Everything that happens will be transparent. Only in cases where security interests require confidentiality will a lower level of transparency be permitted. I believe that the test criteria cover the main expectations and legitimate interests of the public in Europe. They include all natural phenomena, such as high water, extremes of heat and cold, earthquakes and other things. They involve all the nature-related risks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I am more convinced than ever that although the starting point of the Fukushima disaster was a natural event, this was not the sole cause of the disaster. In my opinion, human failure played a significant if not a decisive role in Japan before the earthquake and the tsunami, when it came to improving safety and modernising the plant, and after the disaster with regard to keeping the damage to a minimum.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is why for me the human factor was an important component of the stress test. At first, I was not given adequate support on this issue by the nuclear regulators. I am grateful that Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety were behind me. For this reason, I incorporated their expectations into the negotiations. We have ensured that the human factor is widely represented in the test criteria.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make a very specific distinction here. We have made sure that the human factor and human failure are fully covered in the test criteria. By this we mean an error, a lack of qualifications, poor management of a nuclear power station or a pilot error leading to an aircraft crashing. This means that human issues and human failure are fully represented in the stress test.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling from Mr Turmes)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Turmes, you seem to believe that you can run the parliamentary proceedings with your heckling. Please allow me to finish what I have to say. You will have enough speaking time afterwards.</p>
      <a text="(Applause and heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">I would like to explain to the honourable Member that this subject is so important that I should have at least seven to eight minutes speaking time. Anyway, they are your Rules of Procedure. If you want more speaking time, Parliament itself can decide on this. You are a Member of Parliament and I am not.</p>
      <p sl="de">The subject of human error is fully covered. However, one area which was not included is crime. By this I mean that deliberate attacks on nuclear power stations, perhaps by terrorists, in whatever form, including cyber attacks and attacks by aircraft, do not form part of the stress test. There are two reasons for this. The first is purely formal. The nuclear safety regulators in many of the Member States are not technically responsible for this area and referred the Commission to the responsibilities of the secret service, the police, the air force, the army and the domestic authorities. Therefore, we will now invite the Member States to send representatives from the relevant authorities to us so that we can discuss with these authorities before the summer recess how we can incorporate the consequences of crime.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second reason is that the Member States raised the issue of confidentiality and put forward strong arguments in support of this, which meant that the discussions could not be transparent. We want to submit an interim report in November. I will be happy to enter into further formal discussions with Parliament before the peer review takes place. There is one point which we need to be clear about: thoroughness is more important than speed. I do not agree with the short timeframe which some Member States felt was adequate for the special tests.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe that we can do justice to the test criteria that are so important to us in the space of four to six weeks. Therefore, we may need a period which runs into spring of next year. As far as other issues are concerned, please remember that I am not concerned with the question of whether nuclear power stations are being operated, planned, constructed or shut down. That is the responsibility of the Member States according to my understanding of the law. However, I do feel that I am responsible for safety both with regard to power stations that are in operation and those that are being planned. For this reason, I am grateful that our invitation was accepted on a working level and that Ukraine, Russia, Switzerland, Armenia, Croatia and Turkey agreed to take the next step of a joint European stress test, which will allow a safety investigation to be carried out beyond the borders of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I look forward to reporting the results to you as soon as possible. In addition, I would like to explain that I will also be concerned over the next few months with drawing up strict and objective legal regulations governing nuclear waste. I was rather surprised that the committee did not categorically exclude the possibility of exporting waste to third countries by a large majority.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">I would like to explain to the honourable Member that I am here in my role of Commissioner. My party membership is a private matter. Please make a distinction between Mr Oettinger, the former Christian Democrat, and Commissioner Oettinger. Therefore, I can say as a Commissioner that I was surprised that restrictions were imposed on export bans by a clear majority. Perhaps it would still be possible to change this during the process of reaching a parliamentary decision by the end of June.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, firstly, I would like to thank you very much, Mr Oettinger. In contrast to those people whose fine words just cause uncertainty, you have made sure that something actually happens. That is what makes a difference in politics.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is really starting to get on my nerves, to be quite blunt about it, that some Members of Parliament are constantly demanding more and more, but are not prepared to make a contribution themselves. Mrs Harms, we have failed in Parliament. We did not even manage to adopt a resolution on the subject of safety because you wanted 150% and were not satisfied with what was actually possible as a result of the various responsibilities involved. We have not done our job and neither have you.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the Commissioner has done his job. Six months ago, we would not have expected to have the opportunity to carry out a stress test of this kind. We would never have believed that it would be possible to enter into discussions with states outside Europe on the subject of safety. It is easy to go around shouting about how dreadful everything is and focusing solely on the question of the exit from nuclear power, in other words, all or nothing. It is more difficult but more beneficial for the people of Europe to make progress in this area. What Mr Oettinger has achieved over the last few months is an example to us all. I am not trying to say that everything is exactly how we wanted it. We will only be able to tell at the end if this is what we wanted. Mrs Harms and Mr Turmes, it is simply not acceptable to spend your time permanently complaining and heckling and then, when you are called on to do something, to vote against better safety levels for nuclear power plants. The resolution was here on the table and you voted against it. You weakened the position of Parliament and of the Commission, when we wanted to improve the safety of European nuclear power stations. That is a fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have had enough of this constant hypocrisy. It is dishonest and it does not allow us to make progress. Of course the situation is complicated, but everyone is familiar with the legal position. It is naïve to believe that we can do what we want. There is a very specific legal position which we have to follow. The things that have been achieved here within that framework are very interesting and important. You may think that the endless heckling is funny, but it does not get us anywhere.</p>

For me, it is highly regrettable that we are once again fighting over the question of yes or no. You know that I personally hold a very individual view on this issue but I have been prepared to compromise and to find common ground in Parliament in order to improve the safety of European nuclear power stations in their current locations, which is where they are likely to stay.

      <p sl="de">Secondly, I explained during the debate and I will explain once again that I have learned a lesson from this. I now realise that we need to do more to introduce tougher safety standards for European nuclear power stations. We need to exert more pressure and show more initiative.</p>

Those nuclear plants that are now intended to be built on the EU’s eastern borders belong to that exact category as their technology has not been experimented with before in more distant places. The assurances that they will be safe are only empty assurances.</p>

However, I believe that you are right when you say that not only must we deal carefully with the subject of the safety of European nuclear power stations, but that we must also take responsibility for influencing the construction and the condition of other power stations, in as far as we can.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Oettinger has said that he is making every effort to promote the stress tests and possible changes in the directives in other areas of the world and is committed to ensuring that these higher safety standards are adopted.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Mr Reul, you are the chair of the committee. Ladies and gentlemen, let us all calm down a little.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, in the meeting that we had on the day before your meeting with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), my group explained to you what our position on this question was. Now I must tell you we are not totally satisfied. Why is this?</p>
      <p sl="es">This is so because we believe that the stress tests should have been made obligatory. However, we are pleased to hear that the 143 European nuclear plants are going to be subject to the stress tests, and we also support the Commission in its efforts to persuade third countries to re-evaluate their plants as well. Furthermore, we are not satisfied because we believe that stress tests, which, in fact, are going to be carried out by the operators themselves, should be subjected to a second opinion in order to ensure greater objectivity. The peer review method, involving seven experts, is one step. However, our group’s proposal was to create an independent control mechanism which was supposed to operate from the outset and not in the later results analysis phase.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also think that the tests should be carried out on other facilities, such as research reactors, and in respect of other threats, such as the fallout from a terrorist attack or a plant’s structural weaknesses. We are conscious of the competition issues that have arisen but we think that a better agreement could have been reached.</p>
      <p sl="es">Carrying out a risk analysis now is an appropriate but isolated measure. Therefore, to guarantee maximum safety, my group proposes that an independent organisation be created at a European level that would assume responsibility for safety and control.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say to you that what we hope for now is consistency, so that reactors that do not pass the tests and that cannot remedy their deficiencies are closed, and transparency, so that all citizens have complete information about the test procedure and results.</p>

    <intervention id="4-069-000" speaker_id="28127" name="Lena Ek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, this is not an internal German issue, but a European issue. It is vital that nuclear facilities across Europe are both safe and seen to be safe. The mistakes of the first banking stress test must therefore not be repeated; we do not need another pointless PR exercise.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is the responsibility of the Commission to make sure that the stress tests are conducted in a solid, transparent and comprehensive manner and that they have real consequences. If a plant fails the test and if the issues raised cannot be remedied, it should be shut down. The proposed stress tests are, however, too weak. The ALDE Group has called for the entire safety culture and the human factor to be included in the test. This is unfortunately not the case. I sincerely hope that the Commission finds another way forward to test the safety culture.</p>
      <p sl="de">For instance, I expect the Commission to put forward proposals as part of the revision of the nuclear safety directive to remedy these problems. This includes the issues that you raised, Commissioner, of security in respect of decommissioning and waste. The stress test also lacks clear wording on the need for the independence and transparency of the tests. There will be a peer review, with representatives from Member States other than the one where the concerned nuclear plant is situated, but they will not necessarily be fully independent. That is a problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are all problems for the credibility of the tests, but the stress tests are only the beginning. We need a strategy which goes beyond this and that provides European common standards guaranteeing a high level of nuclear safety and information.</p>
      <p sl="de">The safety of nuclear power plants is a European issue. Looking ahead, we should implement stricter safety standards than the International Atomic Energy Agency recommendations and the rest of the world. If you look at the information and the transparency in the Fukushima accident, there is a real need for a European platform and for European regulation on this issue. European citizens expect and deserve the best possible safety for their nuclear power plants.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is precious little time and there is a heavy responsibility on the European Commission, and certainly more now on the Member States, who are weakening and backing off from what they promised initially after what happened in Japan. We ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities and we ask the Council, which is not here, to meet the expectations of the European citizens when it comes to nuclear safety in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to share with you some extracts from the interim report of the UK Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations: ‘we all need to adhere to the principal of continuous improvement. That means that, no matter how high the standards of nuclear design and subsequent operation are, the quest for improvement should never stop’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK nuclear regulatory system is largely non-prescriptive. That means that the industry must demonstrate to the regulator that it fully understands the hazards associated with its operations and knows how to control them. So we expect the industry to take the prime responsibility for learning lessons, rather than relying on the regulator to tell it what to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Conclusion number one reads: ‘in considering the direct causes of the Fukushima accident, we see no reason for curtailing the operation of nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities in the UK’. Conclusion two reads: ‘in response to the Fukushima accident, the UK nuclear power industry has reacted responsibly and appropriately, displaying leadership for safety and a strong safety culture in its response to date’. Conclusion four reads: ‘to date, the consideration of the known circumstances of the Fukushima accident has not revealed any gaps in scope or depth of the safety assessment principles for nuclear facilities in the UK’.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, let us remember the extraordinary nature of the earthquake and the strength of the tsunami that hit the Fukushima installation and which has started all this process.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, so far, the debate has gone as I expected it to, but not as I wanted it to. Initially after Fukushima, you moved in the right direction and set yourself objectives which included a comprehensive, in-depth investigation of all the risks presented by European nuclear power stations on the basis of what we had learnt at the time from Fukushima. Now we know even more about Fukushima, including the fact that the disaster was systematically played down and that the core meltdowns occurred much earlier than the Japanese admitted. We also know about the problems in the monitoring systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, today you have made a big mistake. As a Commissioner who is taking over a responsibility which he does not have, you should have said: ‘Mrs Harms, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I have taken on a big task, but I have only made a small amount of progress’. You should have referred to the fact that there are major problems, that the stress tests are purely voluntary, that they are only being carried out on paper and that they are largely in the hands of the operators, which is where they always have been. You should have admitted this and then I would have been able to take you more seriously. In that case, we could have had further useful discussions about what has and has not been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">What you have presented us with, Mr Oettinger, is basically a strategy which will help to play down the risks involved in the European nuclear power programme as it currently stands. At some point, there will be a sort of Oettinger seal of approval on the old reactors which will certify that tests have once again been carried out on paper of all the things that have often been tested before.</p>
      <p sl="de">You really have little to say on the subject of safety and we have not moved much further on from that. Because of the Euratom Treaty, Parliament has almost no influence over nuclear safety and we have not made any progress in that area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will be interested to see how the debate about genuine common safety standards goes. This is what we will judge you on again. However, that is in the future and what we have achieved so far is extremely poor.</p>

If I were to say anything about Germany, it would be this: I believe it is right that the German Government, under the leadership of climate policy expert Klaus Töpfer, for example, has said that the risks involved in these power stations are too great, that in the case of a disaster, the risks would be unmanageable and that this is why Germany is getting out of nuclear power. I believe it is important to mention this here from a German perspective. However, I said nothing about this in my previous speech.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I would like to say on the subject of Japan that TEPCO and other operators of nuclear power plants maintained before Fukushima that their plants were technically equipped to withstand all the types of earthquake that were likely to occur. There were forecasts and warnings that there would be a horror tsunami of this kind. I do not understand why the International Atomic Energy Agency did not intervene earlier.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, I am outraged. The stress tests for nuclear power plants in the EU give the operators an alibi to continue running their reactors and are intended to conceal the actual danger represented by the so-called residual risks, in particular, if the power plants do not have to be shut down when the results of the stress tests are negative.</p>
      <p sl="de">The failure to include the risk of terrorism in the stress tests means that the profits of the nuclear power companies will be protected against costly modernisation measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Radioactive radiation does not stop at national borders. In order to protect the people of Europe and its neighbouring countries, the EU should develop a Europe-wide exit strategy, call on its neighbours to get out of nuclear power as part of its neighbourhood policy and, in this way, prevent new nuclear power stations from being built. The prerequisite for this is the dissolution of the Euratom Treaty, which is used to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry. In the past, loans of more than EUR 500 million have been made available to Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine alone for the construction of new nuclear power stations.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, today, if we were to balance the benefits of the nuclear industry and the dangers it poses on a pair of scales, it is difficult to say which one would outweigh the other. Experience has shown that nuclear power plants are rather vulnerable – both Chernobyl 25 years ago and Fukushima a few months ago.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Very close to Lithuania, on the European Union’s external border, there are plans to build disproportionately powerful nuclear power plants, actually they are already being built, the safety and environmental impact of which is causing much controversy. An accident in these power plants would pose huge dangers to both Lithuania and the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We must ensure that the highest safety standards are applied not just in Europe, but beyond its borders as well. We must make every effort to ensure the introduction of a requirement for compulsory nuclear power plant safety checks worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In the area of nuclear safety, there is a particular focus on the European Commission. It must monitor and check whether this approach is mirrored in neighbouring countries, particularly those intending to build nuclear power plants next to the EU’s external borders, and whether the provisions of international conventions are properly implemented or are little more than a piece of paper. We must ensure that not just European Union Member States, but neighbouring countries, in particular, Russia and Belarus, comply with the most stringent safety and environmental standards.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in Austria, where you like to spend your holidays, we are doing very well when it comes to nuclear power plants. The radioactive intensity of today’s debate does, of course, have one benefit. It reminds you, Mr Oettinger, that you can undergo a road-to-Damascus conversion and switch from being a friend of EnBW, the German power company, to being the person responsible for monitoring nuclear power stations. If you do really well, you may even be drawing up the exit strategy. However, you must be aware that this will involve a struggle over responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ‘more’ that you promised us is not enough and, of course, it is very important for you to put pressure on a joint neighbouring country of ours, the Czech Republic, which, as far as I understand it, would prefer to not take part in any kind of more critical test, in particular, with regard to crimes. You should also be exerting pressure on the blatant nuclear lobbyists from the United Kingdom, which brings us to the main topic.</p>
      <p sl="de">Do not allow yourself to be influenced by the lobbyists in the Commission. Take a look at who really holds the power in important organisations such as the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) and the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA). Keep an eye on Dominique Ristori, a Commission official who is invisibly but inextricably linked with the nuclear lobby, and on other Commission officials.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, we have to be careful how debates develop. When the Commissioner is constantly being interrupted, there is then an avalanche of questions from other Members of the House, and it is very difficult for the debate to remain on the subject that is being examined and in relation to the points the Commissioner has raised, rather than other Members’ wishes.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The 58 reactors in France or those in the United Kingdom or those in many other countries do not mean that the French or others may be more stupid or less intelligent, or that the future of their children does not worry them, or that they have never thought about nuclear safety.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety is something that is being continually worked on in all nuclear plants in relation to every nuclear reactor. There are many top-quality professionals, not people sitting here spouting hot air, but rather people that have been working on these issues day in day out since the beginning.</p>
      <p sl="es">Is a joint review of stress tests now required? I am completely in agreement, and I have to say that some of the people that are now talking about these issues refused to endorse this Parliament’s joint resolution on this subject, which was supported by the majority of the groups in the House.</p>
      <p sl="es">On that basis, a distinction must be made: we are talking about stress tests and not the abolition of nuclear energy. Those will be national debates and they will have to be carried out there.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why, speaking of stress tests, because some people do not want to talk about it, they only speak or discuss this in one debate or another with an undertone of eliminating nuclear energy, I have to say that Commissioner Oettinger has done an extraordinary job in a very short time. He has already agreed and carried out, in practice, a series of measures and tests that will show us the extent of the situation we are now in.</p>

      <p sl="de">However, we must admit that we are skating on very thin ice with these stress tests. You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure. Of course, there is the risk that the inspection will differ from country to country. Some will not want to include aircraft crashes and others will only open up a part of their plants for stress tests. You need to make sure that the tests are genuinely comprehensive.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation. The area of human failure is incomplete. The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside. That is precisely what is not being tested. I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom. We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them. I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism. This really must be included in the stress test.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points? There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing. Will some of the power plants really be shut down or modernised?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in the bank stress tests, as we know, the leeway given was so generous that almost all the institutions investigated were able to come out of the tests relatively well. Whenever a risk was suspected, a less thorough investigation was carried out, just to be on the safe side. We have to presume that things may not be very different in the case of the nuclear power stations. The nuclear stress tests have so far proved simply to be a placebo for the worried citizens of Europe. Apart from the fact that the tests, which have no consequences at the lowest level, are pure nonsense, it is doubtful whether even stringent test criteria would achieve the desired objective. The question always concerns the standards on which the tests will be based, as allegedly none of the 17 German reactors would be approved today, simply because the standards which applied when they were built do not meet current requirements. Critics are doubtful about whether even the brand new nuclear power stations like the European pressurised water reactors being constructed in France and Finland would meet the latest safety requirements. When you find out that some nuclear power plants cannot even withstand storms, all you can do is to call on everyone to work towards getting out of nuclear energy as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important issue today, particularly as regards the European Union’s neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Radioactive contamination is transboundary in nature. This was sorely felt after Chernobyl and Fukushima. The highest nuclear safety standards should therefore be legally binding and global, facilities everywhere should be equally safe, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Standards applied in the European Union are among the highest in the world. To achieve even greater security, we will carry out stress tests in nuclear power plants that are functioning, those that are planned and those that have been closed. However, if we want to be safe, identical criteria should be applied to facilities already existing or planned in the EU’s neighbourhood (Russia, Belarus, Turkey, Armenia, Switzerland and Ukraine). As we consistently strive for this, we must speak with one voice.</p>
      <p sl="lt">At the moment, less than 100 km from the European Union’s external border, near St Petersburg, a nuclear power plant with a Chernobyl-type reactor is still in operation. Russia is planning to build two new nuclear power plants even closer to the European Union’s borders in Belarus and Kaliningrad. From the Lithuanian border, it will be possible to see the chimneys of one of these power plants just as clearly as we can we the tower of Strasbourg Cathedral from Parliament. Both projects have similar problems. Work has begun even before the environmental impact assessment is completed and, as yet, there has been no explanation of the criteria for choosing the construction site of either nuclear power plant, possible alternative sites have not been analysed and general evacuation plans have not been drawn up. There are plans for both nuclear power plants to have experimental reactors, the safety of which is impossible to evaluate, as they have not yet been in operation anywhere.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Generally speaking, Belarus is not ready to develop nuclear energy, and the Russian Government is not only failing to answer the questions put by neighbouring countries, but is ignoring its population’s requests for consultations. For a second time, through the use of red tape, it is refusing to allow the registration of an initiative regarding a public referendum on the issue of nuclear power plant construction. One of the steps that might encourage the European Union’s neighbours to comply with the highest safety standards would be for the whole of the Union to refuse to buy electricity produced while failing to respect these standards. We must not use EU citizens’ money to support unsafe nuclear energy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate. We need comprehensive stress tests. Fukushima has shown that we must imagine the unimaginable. The method currently used fails to take into account risks such as terrorist attacks or plane crashes, and therefore does not meet this requirement. We need a transparent debate, because the choice whether to continue or stop must be based on broad public consensus that is informed but not bypassed by expert discussions. We need an independent debate in the presence of all parties, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest and promote appeasement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours. Instead of establishing full national control over these issues, why not at least encourage a sharing of expertise between our security agencies? Security would benefit, as would transparency and citizenship at European level.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, we actually have two questions facing us. The first is about the nuclear share in Europe. On this issue, I believe that in the coming year, we must have a transparent public debate within the Union and within the Member States concerned. The second question is about the tests that have brought us all here this morning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to mention to you, Commissioner, the four principles that I think we should keep for a genuine control mechanism. The first principle is that a control mechanism must be obligatory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second principle is that this control mechanism should be entrusted to an independent and impartial authority. I do not have much faith in self-regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third principle is that this mechanism should be binding. If the tests should ever give negative results for particular installations, then these tests should have a binding effect on Member States, which would then have no choice but to close those non-functioning installations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fourth point is that this mechanism must be transparent: the results must be put before public opinion. In this way, we will perhaps be able to bring about what Mrs Ek has called a European safety culture.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, nuclear safety issues – both in the Member States and in neighbouring countries – should be the object of the European Union’s particular attention. Following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan, the Commission announced stress tests for similar facilities in the European Union. This was very good news and a very good decision. We are waiting for it to be implemented. In view of the safety needs of all the people of Europe, particular attention should be given to making the appropriate use of all available means in order to raise safety standards and eliminate potential threats from nuclear energy. It is not only power stations lying within the Member States which are a potential danger, but also those located in countries which are neighbours of the Union. It is also necessary to provide suitable motivation and support for the Member States to conduct thorough stress tests of the Union’s power stations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to underscore the profound need for additional investment, both in research into nuclear power and in other important research aimed at anticipating and combating accidents and their adverse effects in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, using the example of the Cattenom nuclear power station which threatens hundreds of thousands of people in Luxembourg and also in the German regions of the Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate, I would like to explain why these watered-down stress tests will not do the job.</p>
      <p sl="de">Cattenom is on the approach path to Luxembourg airport and it is precisely the consequences of a plane crashing on Cattenom which are not being investigated. After the first document was submitted by the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), you yourself tabled an amendment to have aircraft crashes included in the initiating events on page 4 of the document. This amendment, which was a good one, was blocked by France and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="de">It disturbs us that you have fought for this and lost and that you have still not been able to admit that you have lost. That is dishonest and this is why we are critical of you. We must make it clearer that France and the United Kingdom are currently not cooperating over the things that we and you both want. We need to take an honest look at this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Liese, the German Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union did not support us on the famous resolution about the exit from nuclear power. Chancellor Merkel is rather braver than you are, at least on this occasion.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I think this is a European issue, not a question of which Member States have nuclear industries and which do not: it is an issue for the whole of Europe, and Europe desperately needs good news. I must tell you, sincerely, that one of those items of good news is guaranteeing the public that we are taking care of their safety.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If these tests are carried out under the terms that you are presenting, Commissioner, whereby the first stage is undertaken by the stakeholders themselves, the second stage is carried out by the governments defending those stakeholders and the third stage is undertaken by partners, who are really stakeholders, I ask myself if the result will not be to say, in the end, that all nuclear plants are in good health and are to be recommended.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that it is not the case, and for this reason I very much hope there will be serious consequences and that we will be able to tell the public that we are taking care of their safety and not just pretending that we are.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Oettinger. He has struggled and he has achieved a great deal. The results are not perfect, but the accusations being made against Mr Oettinger today apply above all to us. We must be self-critical and admit that we did not manage to adopt the resolution. Parts of my group were also not in a position to vote in favour, which is regrettable. However, the accusations also apply to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who first of all signed the resolution and then ultimately failed to support it in plenary. This made Mr Oettinger’s life difficult in his struggle with the Member States to introduce more stringent stress tests.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is the first step, but we must go further. We need to amend the directive. Mr Oettinger, we will support you in ensuring that in future, it is made legally binding. We need to extend it to cover our neighbouring countries. I fully support what Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė has said.</p>
      <p sl="de">Germany has been mentioned several times and, of course, we will have to live with the criticism. However, I would like to point out that 13 EU Member States are already functioning without nuclear energy, including countries with successful economies such as Austria and Denmark, so we must be able to accept this possibility in Germany. I would also like to say that Chancellor Merkel gave a government policy statement today in the German parliament and highlighted once again that we must at least make joint progress in the areas we agree on in Europe. For example, she specifically mentioned energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to give Mr Oettinger my support and encourage him to submit an ambitious proposal on the subject of energy efficiency in two weeks. I am very happy with the parts that we already know about, which are a mix of incentives and obligations for those affected. I do not like the fact that the Member States are supposed to set their own goals. We need the Commission to come up with a target, either mandatory or in the form of a guideline. Please introduce a target and then we will have a very good proposal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, whether you are in favour of nuclear power or, like me, are an ardent supporter of a nuclear-free Europe, all of us should nonetheless be in favour of safety. In this respect, my fellow Members from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) who are preaching modesty are missing the point just a bit. If Fukushima has taught us anything, then it is, more than anything else, that we are unprepared for disasters, that we are unprepared for all sorts of things which could happen tomorrow and which, if they did, would have the gravest possible consequences. For this reason, Commissioner, I am not interested in how many compliments or objections you are going to receive here, at this time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I am interested in are results. We are worried, extremely worried, because the worst thing that could happen is that we carry out stress tests in the near future and get the kinds of results which will provide the perfect excuse for many of the operators of very old power plants, including those in the area where I live, to keep them in operation even longer, instead of closing them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have two questions. How are you going to ensure that the independence of these stress tests really is guaranteed? Secondly, how will you ensure that the results actually will lead to the closure of the oldest nuclear power plants?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, we must deal with the underlying problem and look again at Euratom, as you have said. That is, we must review the question of how free the Member States are to block everything, as France has clearly done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must look again at the unacceptable issues in relation to responsibility – because, if the rules of ordinary law concerning responsibility were applied, we would not have these problems.

My fellow Member, Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, mentioned one reason why the weaknesses of stress tests are very regrettable. Close to St Petersburg, and 200 kilometres from Helsinki and Tallinn, are four Chernobyl-type reactors which threaten the safety of hundreds and thousands of EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, may I say, Commissioner, you have achieved a great deal. In a very short time, you have managed to draw up a very detailed specification of the stress tests and brokered an agreement between the European Commission and the 27 regulatory bodies of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Safety limits, which, on this occasion, exceed the limits of any hypothetical accident, will be reassessed by the Member States. That is an important piece of added value and an additional requirement. Some members have been critical about the human factor not having been assessed or properly taken into account. I have to say that I have personally read closely the specification of these stress tests and am pleased that the tests cover, not just technology, but the human factor and organisational aspects as well.</p>
      <p sl="sl">With this, we have taken a great step forward towards making the safety standards of the European Union uniform and I think that we should look for other ways to go even further; where and how can we take another major step in order to enhance EU powers in this area? In that respect, I expect the European Commission to come up with a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In the interests of greater confidence, international inspections of the tests carried out will be undertaken and that is where I have a question. I wonder whether the group of seven people will be so made up as to consist of representatives of the European Commission and of the regulatory bodies, or will it also include independent experts? If so, I would be interested to know on what basis they will be selected.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I have two more questions. Firstly, will these tests have to be carried out by German nuclear plants which have been shut down? Secondly, what will be the consequences of the closure of German nuclear power plants for the internal European energy market?</p>
      <p sl="sl">As regards the Nuclear Waste Directive, I would say that we will have more opportunities than you have mentioned in your speech to discuss it next time, and I hope that the European Commission will take into account the proposals of the European Parliament because, in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we have voted for several stronger proposals than were originally proposed by the European Commission?.</p>

Even small nations must be prepared for the most severe circumstances, including terrorist attacks and airplane crashes.

      <p sl="en">Lithuania is currently facing such a situation. In close proximity to Vilnius, Belarus – with a total absence of transparency – is beginning to construct a nuclear plant.

      <p sl="fr">As has already been said, our first demand is obviously the revision of this Euratom Treaty, which has remained virtually unchanged since it was first drawn up. Admittedly, the audit of the 143 nuclear reactors in Europe will, in the end, only relate to the ‘Fukushima’ scenario, and you have clearly set the limits for this, Commissioner. That is already a first victory; in any event, it represents a real break from the culture of secrecy that has characterised this sector for more than forty years now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The nuclear industry, more than others, must understand that transparency is crucial for all these issues concerning safety – you definitely repeated the word more than ten times, Commissioner – as is the independence of both the operators and the state supervisory authorities, with the appointment of independent experts, and we are still not satisfied on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the Austrian people voted with a clear majority against nuclear power and this sends a clear message to our politicians. I would like to mention that Mr Palacio has already made a great effort to give Europe more room for manoeuvre in this area. Mr Piebalgs’ nuclear safety directive was also successful. I hope that we will soon have a new nuclear safety directive which is binding and which lays down the inspection procedures and the standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should be evaluating which of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards are available to us and which can be incorporated into EU law in a legally binding way. Of course, one-off stress tests are not enough. In future, there must be a series of stress tests so that dangerous nuclear power plants can be shut down immediately. In order to achieve this, we need an EU regulator who has joint powers with the national regulators and who is entitled to disconnect from the grid any power stations which fail to meet these standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can only endorse what has already been said today. The Euratom Treaty must be revised. We must call on the Heads of State or Government to ensure that this becomes a joint European issue in the Council. It must not be the case as it has generally been in the past in the Council that the nuclear working group opposes anything which comes out of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Most importantly, we need research within the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) into the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. We also need research into final storage and we should be focusing on protection, safety, training and inspections. We must introduce the clearing house model that is currently in front of us into European legislation. Mr Oettinger, you can rely on the support of this House in this respect.</p>

I also agree that we should extend this stress test in neighbouring countries, the countries east of our borders. This is why I ask the Commission to consider the possibility of how to execute a stress test in the context of the Eastern partnership.</p>
      <p sl="hu">And finally, Commissioner, protection against cyber attacks and terrorist attacks has to be established in all sectoral policies of the European Union where cross-border emission of hazardous materials may occur. The incumbent Hungarian Government failed the stress test you envision, Commissioner, because it has repeatedly impeded the construction of the NATO radar facility, which would have provided greater protection for the Paks nuclear power plant against aircraft attacks than the protection we have today, for the past seven years.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, it is vital that we set the bar high with these stress tests and that the tests are actually conducted according to the same criteria across the whole of Europe. After all, many nuclear power plants are situated close to national borders, as we know, and also in very densely populated areas. The fact that we are going to have an independent and objective European inspection of every nuclear plant is a very positive thing because this will strengthen the European energy policy. Therefore, full marks to you, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All European citizens have the right to know whether or not those nuclear power plants are actually safe. If acts of terrorism and cyber attacks are not going to be covered by the stress tests, then so be it. You have explained why that is the case and we can understand that. However, that obviously should not exempt the European Commission from its duty to continue badgering Member States about this and to maintain pressure on the national security services so that these services actually investigate whether the plants are going to be prepared for those risks, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, the credibility of these tests will stand or fall on the implementation of the results. We will have to take into account the probability that some of the 143 nuclear power plants in Europe will not pass these tests, that the weakest will go to the wall and that several plants will perhaps have to close. Then, naturally, a unique moment of opportunity for us to switch to renewable sources of energy will present itself. It is clear, as Mr Leinen said a little while ago, that at that moment, a solution will primarily present itself at a European level. It is also clear that we should opt for joint European investments, coordinated investments, and for joint European financing through project bonds. We are counting on you to take the lead at that moment, in this new step towards the development of that European energy policy. Thank you and good luck.</p>

We should not be attesting to the safety of nuclear power plants: we have to investigate what exactly the risks are and not give people a false sense of security.

      <p sl="nl">I agree with my fellow Members, Belet and Leinen, that this matter should no longer fall under the Euratom Treaty. Our citizens are entitled to maximum security and it is time we removed this aspect from the Euratom Treaty. Are you going to start that debate?</p>

I would nevertheless point out again that nuclear power is part of the energy mix that we here in this Parliament wanted and hoped for.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, I would like to complain a bit about this debate, with its appeals to collective fear. This is regrettable when we are dealing with a subject as important as this one. It is true that nuclear power stations can, in certain cases, pose risks, but I am quite shocked because there is a certain mistrust here in this Parliament of staff who work in nuclear power stations on a daily basis and who ensure the safety of our nuclear power from day to day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would ask you to be responsible, therefore. We know that there is a desire in the European Union to ensure the security of our power stations from day to day. I would also like to add that we know perfectly well that flying over nuclear power stations is prohibited – at least, in France – and that there is no nuclear power station in France which is further than 25 km from an air base, with the air bases being responsible for monitoring the air space above nuclear power stations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So yes, Commissioner, we agree with you. We are in agreement on these tests. Congratulations, you have got them. These tests are essential, because we have to make sure that our populations regain confidence in our nuclear power stations. These tests are essential; they must take place in a spirit of complete independence so that this confidence can be regained. We can also see, however, that confidentiality is necessary in certain cases. When it comes to combating terrorism, we cannot conceive of a Member State revealing strategic plans for combating terrorism in advance.</p>

The information reaching us from Japan is, at times, horrific and terrifying, and shows that serious contamination of the country has occurred. None of us would like this to be repeated in Europe, just as no one would like a repeat of Chernobyl. On the contrary, to put society’s fears at ease, it is all the more necessary to do everything to guarantee the safety of nuclear energy in Europe. This is why the stress tests are so important. However, it is also important that they be carried out very thoroughly, to guarantee objectivity and to provide credibility and the certainty that their conduct will allow the anticipation of emergency situations and crises, which can happen just the same in Europe as they have done in Japan. We must do everything to make Europe safe and restore confidence in this source of energy. However, we should also remember other energy sources, such as the unconventional shale gas, for example.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, for many years, nuclear power was considered to be the energy of the future – green, efficient, non-polluting. The tragedies in Chernobyl and, recently, in Fukushima, have shown the other side of the coin. However, our objective today cannot be – as the Left would like – to conduct stress tests only so that with a biased interpretation of their results, there will be a pretext for giving up nuclear energy in Europe. Today, our objective must be to improve the safety of nuclear power plants, calm public opinion and change the negative image of nuclear power in Europe. This should be our priority today. Therefore, I do not understand the voices of the Left which are talking about another tax on nuclear energy and the ultimate abandonment of this type of energy source. That route, at a time when there is a lack of alternative sources, will lead to jumps in electricity prices. Today, Europe needs revision of the law on nuclear energy in the areas of the responsibilities of Member States, establishment of common rules and optimisation of safety standards in the Union. The stress tests must answer our questions about safety and take account of all possible forms of danger, from terrorist attacks to power cuts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that today, the European Union is changing its internal policy regarding nuclear safety but, at the same time, we are beginning work on external energy policy. At one point in the future, these policies should be merged.</p>
      <p sl="en">The nuclear stress tests should not only help the Commission revise the safety directive, but should also be included in the Commission report on the external dimension of energy policy which will soon be published. Stress tests and energy safety should form a crucial part of our energy dialogue with third countries. We need to ensure that new plants in Kaliningrad and Belarus are subject to the same standards and tests as such facilities in the European Union, especially now that Russia wants to invest in nuclear power plants.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, safeguarding nuclear safety is an issue relevant for all countries, whether they have nuclear power plants or not. Of course, we can express indignation over what has happened in the past, but today, it is clear that we must move forward. Commissioner, it is really commendable that, following the Fukushima accident, you responded promptly and initiated the idea of testing nuclear power plants and it is also good that the Member States have agreed to carry out these tests. However, there is no system at all concerning the construction of new nuclear power plants close to the European Union’s borders, as has already been mentioned several times when discussing the construction of the Kaliningrad and Belarusian nuclear power plants. I therefore believe that we must initiate and adopt appropriate legislation, as a matter of urgency, which would ensure systematic, binding procedures, based on clear principles, for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants. We would then have objective information about the possible threat and might hope to avoid it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to point out to you that, at its international meeting in Kiev on the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, the Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire stated that a serious accident would take place in Europe within twenty years, hence the importance of the stress tests and of enhancing the security and safety of reactors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are faced, however, with ageing power plants and the practice of subcontracting. 80% of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractors. Furthermore, we are familiar with the geostrategy of terrorist risks. When we look at these stress tests as they relate to France, they become ‘relaxation tests’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, congratulations for introducing these stress tests, but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States, including the United Kingdom and France. This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue, but must be a European issue, the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation for the way that the European Commission, in launching a transparent review of all 143 nuclear power plants in the European Union, has acted swiftly to assuage Europeans’ concerns that the large number of nuclear power plants throughout Europe could be a risk to them.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, we need to understand that these stress tests are just the beginning of an extensive dialogue on this issue, because only after evaluating the tests will we be able to see the true state of the nuclear power sector in Europe. I am confident that the data from the stress tests will prepare us for a new round of talks on this issue, where we will discuss a new safety policy for the European Union in this field. Today, then, rather than cast doubt on the Commission’s efforts to review the security risks of our nuclear power plants, let us try to gather as much objective information about their actual condition as we can. This will help us in our future decision making on nuclear safety in Europe.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-122-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, I will be happy to discuss your main comments and proposals relating to the stress tests that will be carried out over the next few months. First of all, however, if you are concerned that a watered-down stress test will turn into a seal of approval without the necessary objectivity, I can assure you that I will do everything possible during the months to come, together with my offices, to ensure that this assumption is unfounded.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">This is currently a concern which I completely understand, but some Members also have prejudices. I would like to ask you not to judge any of the nuclear power stations and also not to judge me and my work until after the stress tests have been completed. That is my offer to everyone, including Mrs Harms and Mr Turmes, and I am prepared to take a critical and transparent approach to the next steps in the process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, if we assume that the outcome of the stress tests will not be a placebo and that the seal of approval will not be handed out randomly, but instead that the tests will be constructive, critical and objective, then I believe that these stress tests will bring many benefits and that the alternative, not carrying out any stress tests, would be a worse solution.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We have had some tough negotiations. The first draft did not fulfil my requirements. However, the version that was signed largely meets the expectations of the citizens, who are legitimately concerned about high levels of safety in Europe. I would like to explain once again, Mr Turmes, that if I had not signed the revised and, in my opinion, positive version of the test criteria, we would now have nothing. As the saying goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that you can expect me to be thorough and objective, but I have noticed a few things. One was the speech by a Member from the United Kingdom of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe whose party is part of the coalition government in the UK. This party was opposed to nuclear power before the elections and supported it afterwards and this is the person who is criticising my thoroughness when it comes to the stress tests. I can only say that this speech would have been more appropriate at the party conference in London than it was here in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another speech comes to mind. The Spanish Government did not give me any visible support on the subject of the thorough stress tests. For this reason, a speech by a Member who belongs to the party which is in government in Spain is also not very helpful.</p>
      <p sl="de">That also applies to the group to which I belong, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Some of the speeches made on behalf of the groups unfortunately demonstrate how unsuccessful the representatives of the groups have so far been within their own parties in their own home countries in achieving their objectives. In sporting terms, I am interested in what will appear on this subject in the election manifesto of the French socialist party. I am very interested in who the candidate will be and what the manifesto will look like. However, the Parliament here in Strasbourg cannot control matters which fall within the remit of the nation states.</p>
      <p sl="de">To get to the heart of the matter, the energy mix remains a matter for the national governments and parliaments. We may welcome this or we may regret it. As a democrat, I have to accept it. The fact that independent teams are now, for the first time, monitoring the national nuclear regulators and that the monitors are being monitored is, in my opinion, an historic step forwards in the interest of the common safety of the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Turmes, aircraft crashes are covered by the stress tests. The consequences of an aircraft crashing onto a nuclear power station are specifically included in the test criteria and, therefore, form part of the investigation in the third stage. I will be happy to show you. Mr Turmes, if every Member of this House were as noisy as you are, there would be chaos in the Chamber. Only one person can get away with this. I will be happy to talk about this afterwards. Aircraft crashes do form part of the investigation because the impact of a crash on the safety of nuclear power plants is specifically covered in the criteria.</p>
      <p sl="de">My next point is that I have been accused of concealing the voluntary nature of the tests. Exactly the opposite is true. From the first meeting in committee onwards, I have always emphasised that the stress test is voluntary. However, we have persuaded every Member State to take part. All 14 Member States have voluntarily opted to become involved, which is a big success for the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">What will happen at the end? I would like to make it quite clear that I am relying on the power of facts. If there are serious problems with a particular nuclear power station, the citizens of Europe and of the relevant Member State will call for the necessary measures to be taken. This is what I believe and this is why transparency, thoroughness and objectivity are so important. I am determined to promote this over the next few months. The proposal to revise the Euratom Treaty is wonderful. However, the Euratom Treaty is primary law and, therefore, is not the concern of the Commission but of the Member States. A change to the Euratom Treaty requires unanimity. I can only say to anyone who has good proposals to make on this subject: do you really believe, given the variety of opinions and moods and the supporters and opponents of nuclear power, that we would be likely to achieve unanimity about the continuation of the Euratom Treaty? I do not believe that it is very likely. For this reason, I am in favour of taking a realistic approach and making the best we can out of the Treaty that we have.</p>
      <p sl="de">The next question concerns the independence of the test. The peer review during the third stage, which is the main part of the test, involves a team with seven external members. It has been specifically stated that the team can include experts from third countries. It also involves the Commission. You can rely on me to make sure that the Commission officials do not bring any preconceptions or prejudices with them and do their work thoroughly and objectively. To assume otherwise would be unfair to our officials. This is why I will be standing up for my officials during this process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then there is the question of Belarus and Russia. The fact is that our authority, yours here in Parliament and ours in the Commission, is unfortunately very limited in Minsk. We simply have to accept that. Perhaps we will come up with some ideas about how we can get the government there back on track. However, at the moment we simply have to accept that the government in power in Minsk has no policies, no transparency, no democracy and no concept of safety. For this reason, we can only call on the government to change. We cannot do any more.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a much better partnership with Russia. The subject of safety tests for nuclear power stations will play a central role in our discussions with our partners in Russia over the next few weeks. A question was asked about Kaliningrad. My message to the Members from the Baltic States and from Poland is as follows: we can only apply our strictest technical specifications to the nuclear power station which is being planned and which will be built in Kaliningrad if we allow the electricity from this power station to be sold on the European market.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, if we do not accept the electricity and an electricity exchange is not possible, because we are planning our own nuclear power stations in the Baltic States, we will have less control over the technology used in Kaliningrad than if we had an open electricity market. I will be happy to have more in-depth discussions on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, please believe me when I say that I will not allow a watered-down stress test to take place. However, please accept, on the other hand, the fact that the stress test does not include an automatic mechanism for shutting down a power station simply because you have not been successful with your programmes in your Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ga">After what happened in Japan recently, it is crucial that stress tests be carried out on European nuclear plants to assess health standards and risks, avoid potential disasters and alleviate public concern. It is a major concern for the people of Ireland that no stress test will be done in Sellafield, which is located just a few hundred kilometres from the coast of Ireland. There is a significant risk to Ireland from those nuclear plants on the British coast. Sellafield is the best-known station and that is where there was a significant leakage a little while ago, in 2005. The response of the British authorities was that an exemption applies in the case of Sellafield because power is no longer being generated there. That is of little comfort to those in Ireland who will suffer greatly in the event of an accident. The Sellafield station is very close to Ireland and there have been many accidents there to date, and therefore I am asking the Commission to put pressure on the British authorities to stress-test the station because it continues to be a risk to the people of Ireland.</p>

      <p sl="lv">After the nuclear accident at Fukushima, EU Member States collectively agreed that the European Union must conduct stress tests on nuclear plants, and asked the entire world to do so as well. We still do not have any news regarding whether such tests will be conducted on those reactors operating in other European nations that are not EU Member States. The safety of reactors located in these states directly affects the safety of European citizens. Our citizens are justifiably concerned whether the Union will be able to ensure the safety of new nuclear power plants that are being built, or are scheduled to be built, in the direct vicinity of EU Member States, such as those in Grodno (Belarus), and in the Russian Kaliningrad region. Neither Russia nor Belarus have conducted environmental impact assessments on these power plants in accordance with generally accepted international standards, as called for in the Espoo convention, to which all EU Member States are signatories. I believe that the construction of these nuclear power plants next to the borders of the EU can pose a threat not only to EU Member States, but also to the entire continent of Europe. This should be a matter of concern for the entire EU. The European Commission must pay due attention to this issue and must actively work to ensure safety. We must ensure that Russia and Belarus adhere to international standards and cooperate with international experts in all the phases of nuclear power plant planning, construction and operation.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Here, we are discussing stress tests for nuclear power plants because of Fukushima. I recall the part-session in April, at which some Members seemed to lose all sense of proportion right after the accident. Some associated the thousands of victims of the tsunami with the damage to the nuclear power plant. People in the House wondered if the thousands of victims were not enough. They asked how many nuclear accidents would it actually take before there was sufficient evidence. I could not believe my ears.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Even now, there are no actual victims who have died from radiation at Fukushima. Despite the fact that Japan suffered one of the biggest ever earthquakes recorded, followed by one of the biggest tsunamis that has ever occurred, even though they were not prepared for them, even though they had not even carried out the improvements suggested, even though nothing had been done to ensure that there would be a supply of power in the event of emergencies, and even though the Japanese made other mistakes right at the start, there were few personal injuries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is no doubt, of course, that the accident at Fukushima was a catastrophe. It should not have happened. There are likely to be fatalities, but they will be nothing compared to the fatalities due to coal power, for example. In Europe, airborne fine particles due to energy consumption now kill around 300 000 people each year. It is therefore paradoxical that the Fukushima accident will lead to tens of thousands of indirect victims. They will die prematurely because Europe will give up using nuclear power and replace it with fossil energy. Air quality will worsen, which will increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease and threaten the lives of asthma sufferers. The real killer behind the Fukushima disaster is therefore coal, to which they are now switching in Germany, for example.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Commission must include neighbouring states as well when carrying out the stress tests, applying to them the same test criteria established at EU level and taking into account the cross-border nature of the possible effects of nuclear energy. Romania is already in the process of carrying out the stress tests. In assessing them, we are interested in consideration being given to the specific nature of the nuclear technology used in Romania, compared with the nuclear technologies used in the EU. This is why I think that the following points should be borne in mind when carrying out and assessing the stress tests:</p>
      <p sl="ro">the tests being applied should take into account the nuclear technology used at the power plant, which may include special characteristics that it has, without having to use test ‘templates’;</p>
      <p sl="ro">the stress tests should be evaluated on technical grounds and not on political grounds or grounds which leave room for speculation;</p>
      <p sl="ro">the independent peer review team should also include the national regulatory authority, along with representatives from the neighbouring countries, with a view to exchanging experience on emergency plans.</p>

      <p sl="lt">No one is arguing that the consequences of the disaster in the nuclear power plant will be long-lasting, both for the environment and people, and do not stop at the border. Three months have already passed since the disaster in Japan, and we still do not know how all of the issues will be addressed. The European Commission reacted to this disaster in a rapid and adequate manner, proposing stress tests for all nuclear power plants and striving for more stringent nuclear safety standards. Meanwhile, regular audits would strengthen nuclear safety and residents’ confidence in nuclear energy. However, we can now see that stress tests will be difficult to implement even within the EU, although everyone understands the importance of and need for such tests. Furthermore, we cannot simply focus on nuclear safety in the EU. If the current nuclear power plant projects in Kaliningrad and Astravo on the EU border are implemented without complying with the highest international safety requirements, they will pose a threat not just to the neighbouring Baltic countries but to the whole of Europe, which is relatively near. The European Commission has confirmed on several occasions that some neighbouring countries – Ukraine, Russia, Sweden and Turkey – are ready to join the European stress test programme, but it is still unclear what specific action the Commission intends to take to bring about cooperation, and how the situation will pan out with regard to Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Germany’s recent decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022 marks a new stage in the fundamental rethinking currently taking place in Europe concerning its energy independence and the possible alternatives to nuclear power.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, nuclear power remains an important component of electricity provision in many European countries. The security of nuclear power stations and installations must be at the heart of the Member States’ concerns. Furthermore, nuclear safety tests must not take place exclusively in European power stations, but should also be implemented in every country that produces nuclear power.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The effects of a nuclear disaster often cross national boundaries. With this in mind, I am pleased that, in Paris two days ago, there was agreement on the need for all countries using nuclear installations to implement safety audits in order to assess their capacity to withstand incidents which, up till now, have been considered ‘unlikely’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I congratulate Commissioner Oettinger for finding a consensus on the criteria and the practical details of implementing the stress tests for nuclear installations, which will enable us to ensure the highest safety levels in the world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Sudan is the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, the crossroads at which the Arab and African worlds meet, as well as a mosaic of a great many diverse ethnic groups. As provided in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, a referendum took place in January 2011 which represented the final stage of the process leading to the independence of South Sudan from North Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="it">South Sudan is an area with approximately 10 million inhabitants, covering almost a quarter of the land area of Sudan as currently constituted and possessing about three-quarters of its oil reserves. It is a state that will have to cope with huge geographical and infrastructural limitations, without an outlet to the sea and with a practically non-existent transport network connecting it to northern Sudan, where the oil treatment and transit plant is located. The challenges the South faces are many, beginning with laying the foundations of its own institutions and improving the socio-economic and security frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should note, however, that intervention in this country remains a priority for the European Union. Therefore, in 2010, the Council accorded Sudan a special allocation of EUR 150 million for the period 2011-2013. The European Union must mobilise the entire panoply of instruments at its disposal to support South Sudan in the delicate post-referendum phase. At the same time, we need to maintain a balanced approach in dealing with the North and the South of the country, with particular attention being paid to the needs of the South in terms of institution building and governance.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Sudan is currently in a very sensitive phase ahead of independence day on 9 July this year, when Sudan will be divided into two states. It is extremely important for the EU to continue to provide aid and to direct this aid towards the building of the institutions that are necessary in a well-functioning independent state. We all know that the situation around the Horn of Africa is extremely sensitive, we know that there are problems with the democratic traditions, we know that the situation of women is incredibly difficult and we know that there are problems with pirates.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this context, I would also like to emphasise how important it is that people are able to exercise their human rights and are able to talk and demonstrate freely. This goes for the whole of the Horn of Africa and not least for the Swedish citizen, Dawit Isaak, who is imprisoned in Eritrea. The whole region is in need of democratic development and support from the European Union.</p>

It is a fact that, since Sudan gained its independence in 1956, Sudan and South Sudan have been at war – a civil war –the whole time. That is why it is now very important that, after the referendum, in which almost everyone – more than 98% – wanted independence for South Sudan, this peace process and process of independence is taken forward.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Our task as Europeans is obviously to support democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion, all of which are core values. In that respect, it is important that we are keen to strengthen these democracies and independence for South Sudan.</p>

For us, Russia is an important neighbour, and the better our relations are, the better it is for everyone. I would like to focus attention on the matter of visa waiver. I myself think that it is an important objective, but perhaps we should go slowly. As a representative of a neighbouring country, I can tell you that we cannot rush ahead too fast unless there are readmission agreements that work. In Russia, they obviously have to ensure that the dual identity that people could buy there previously can no longer be obtained.

In other words, I think that this summit could risk being overshadowed by a split on the prohibition of vegetable imports from Europe due to the E coli bacterium.</p>
      <p sl="it">Like the Commission earlier, I find it absurd that Russia should place an embargo on products that we consume every day and on which we carry out thorough checks.

      <p sl="it">I therefore think it would be a good idea to tackle this problem at the summit as well, including asking Russia to lift this disproportionate and unjustified import ban on European Union vegetables immediately, which, as such, is out of line with the principles established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), especially considering that Russia is a candidate for accession to the WTO.</p>

I am not talking about negotiations with Russia on Belarus, as this would only imply that Russia has some sort of ‘special rights’ to this country. However, we must warn Russia, at the highest level, that it is unacceptable to strengthen influence in a neighbouring country by exploiting a situation and negotiating with an authoritarian regime that does not represent the people.

If we can ensure that the cooperation is friendly, but also serious, and if we do not forget to make legitimate demands and highlight legitimate failings, we will be making a step in the right direction, not only in terms of the cooperation between Europe and Russia, but, most importantly, in terms of human rights.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, while researching this subject, I realised that, paradoxically, given the size of the country, this is a question of particular concern in Switzerland, where there is a great deal of information and there are very many publications on the matter, whereas there is much less information coming from Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">It will not be by chance that the problem, even following the implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC, continues to affect a striking number of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers across Europe. Faced as we are with well over 400 petitions, as stated in a paragraph of the resolution, we find ourselves discussing this issue again in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem lies in the fact that there continue to be cases of traders who unwittingly enter into contracts for valuable consideration for entries in a business directory. Those who merely skim over the forms and sign them without thinking and without close examination can be unpleasantly surprised how dearly it will cost them.</p>
      <p sl="it">In recent years, business practices similar to that just described have become widespread throughout Europe. They are difficult to combat effectively with the law as it stands.

Despite the fact that the Committee on Petitions has been working intensively on this subject since 2008, we have not yet seen any significant improvements.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to explain why the situation in Germany is so difficult. It is both mandatory and normal practice in Germany for a legal entity to register its address in an online directory when it is founded. Anyone who registers a company will receive around eight to 10 letters in response. It is likely that one of these will be genuine and the others superfluous. If you reply to the wrong letter and fill out the wrong form during this period of founding a company when you have a lot of work and a great deal of red tape to deal with, you will find that you have signed a contract and are faced with a bill for up to EUR 1 000.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, in general, we devote far too little time in this Parliament to the problems experienced by small businesses. A new form of fraud has developed in which small businesses are tricked into advertising in various types of directory. Then, when they discover that it is fraudulent, they receive a payment demand. The invoice is then passed on to a debt recovery agency and the amount grows and becomes three or even ten times as much in a very short space of time.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The latest development is that these large established fraudulent set-ups are now operating across borders and it then becomes almost impossible for individual small businesses to receive justice. Instead, they are pursued by debt recovery agencies without being able to put a stop to it and without being able to report or get hold of the person responsible for the crime.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In reality, this also means that the cooperation between European police forces must be strengthened, because we must have the ability to see these large-scale cross-border patterns, as this is not a question of small acts of fraud, but of large organised circles of fraudulent activity involving extremely large sums of money, running into millions of euro. Therefore, this is a good resolution, but it is far too weak and we need to take European cooperation further.</p>

We agree, finally, on the need to allocate new European funds to support basic services, notably education, health, agriculture, food security and institutional capacity building. The EU must maintain its humanitarian aid for Sudan and South Sudan even after 9 July 2011, and all political parties must work together to represent all the people of the country fully and to help build stable and democratic political institutions.</p>

Support for South Sudan must be one of our priorities. We would encourage it to sign and to ratify the Cotonou Agreement, which will open the door to new prospects for cooperation. We would encourage it, along with Khartoum, to introduce a pluralistic and multi-ethnic democracy and an independent civil society, with a key role for justice alongside legislative and executive powers. We are delighted that we will be welcoming a South Sudanese parliamentarian once South Sudan has signed and ratified the Cotonou Agreement within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA).

As far as energy security is concerned, we are of the belief that the supply of natural resources should not be used as a means of applying political pressure, but must be based on the principles of interdependence and transparency, together with equal access to markets, infrastructure and investment, so as to establish a legally binding energy framework. We expect, moreover, further cooperation on illegal immigration, improved controls at cross-border checkpoints and information exchange on terrorism and organised crime.</p>

The document also draws attention to important challenges which should be the subject of cooperation between Russia and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Most of all, the fact should be emphasised that the EU and the Russian Federation maintain permanent relations and that their good relations as neighbours influence stability and security not just within the continent of Europe. In addition, both parties are dependent on each other in both economic and political terms. In the resolution which has been adopted, the European Parliament expresses the hope that during the EU-Russia Summit, it will be possible to make advances in the area of visa-free travel and energy security. Parliament also calls on the Russian Federation to demonstrate greater commitment in efforts to combat climate change, chiefly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the light of the forthcoming elections to the Russian Parliament, it is equally important that the elections be held in accordance with the principles established by the Council of Europe and the OSCE. It is also necessary to raise the question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia, which is, after all, a member State of the Council of Europe.</p>

Consequently, Russia and the EU must continue to enhance cooperation and develop good neighbourly relations. Only by using such measures will we be able to guarantee the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond. The Strategic Partnership Agreement is one of the main tools for implementing the goals outlined. In order to ensure that the agreement is properly implemented, both parties must comply with its conditions without exception and meet the commitments made, taking into account the protection of human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law. I feel that the summit will remove obstacles regarding Russia’s accession to the WTO. Russia becoming a full member of the WTO is an important step, which will create a favourable business environment for business operators from both parties and will facilitate and liberalise trade in the global economy. Attention is drawn to the fact that it is very important to address the issues surrounding the liberalisation of the visa regime, gradually introducing visa-free travel between the EU and Russia. Energy and nuclear security is another basis for strong and stable cooperation. The supply of natural resources cannot be used as a political tool. Furthermore, in order to prevent a nuclear disaster, Chernobyl-type reactors must be decommissioned as a matter of urgency and a bilateral agreement to comply with the highest safety standards must be concluded.</p>

      <p sl="en">Parliament has received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies, affecting thousands of mostly small businesses in the European Union, with a significant financial impact. Parliament continues to receive petitions and complaints about business directory companies. The misleading business practices in question typically consist of luring businesses, as well as professionals and non-profit entities, into being listed in a business directory free of charge. Signatories later discover that they have signed up to a contract with a fee. The business directory companies are often established in a different Member State from that of their victims, making it difficult for the latter to seek protection and/or redress from national authorities. The European Parliament urges the Commission to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving Directive 2006/114/EC and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories. I fully agree and I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">In recent years, there has, unfortunately, been a growing trend towards unfair business practices and misleading advertising. In the past, it was generally consumers who were the targets of these scams, but now the fraudulent practices are extending into the business world. The problem is that these fraudulent activities generally take place across national borders, which makes it harder to arrest and prosecute the criminals. Some of the companies constantly change their names and their P.O. box addresses and this also makes it difficult to arrest the people who are pulling the strings. Therefore, it is important for us to close the loopholes in this area so that we can take action against fraud more effectively. However, the measures should be directed not only at the business world and not only, as in the specific case covered here, at the misleading commercial practices of directory companies. Decisive action must also be taken against the various forms of fraud aimed at consumers. I see this petition as a step in the right direction, which should be followed by further measures, and, therefore, I have voted in favour of it.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcome this resolution because we must encourage honest business practices and halt the spread of misleading business practices. To that end, we must set out effective means for redress. Currently, most companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, suffer significant financial losses as a result of such misleading activities. Enterprises receive inaccurate business propositions and they are entrapped into unwanted contracts for advertising in business directories. In this case, national authorities are unable to provide adequate protection or redress because the business directory companies are often established in a different Member State from the businesses affected. This enables business directory companies to abuse the current situation unopposed. In order to stop such dishonest activities as soon as possible, the Commission must compile a blacklist of misleading practices by business directories and adopt relevant legislation, focusing, in particular, on the provisions of the directive on misleading and comparative advertising and the implementation of these. I believe that we must create the right conditions for cooperation between the Member States’ national authorities, which would facilitate the application of administrative or legal measures across borders. The European Union must implement these measures for the Internal Market to be able to function normally, for consumers to be protected, and for business operators to be able to engage in fair business practices.</p>

Therefore, I fully support this resolution that calls on the Commission to proactively verify Member States’ transposition, implementation and national enforcement of Directive 2006/114/EC and take corrective action where needed.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the illegal and unelected regime of Andry Rajoelina is riddled with corruption and has orchestrated serious human rights abuses in Madagascar, yet Rajoelina came to power pledging an end to corruption and human rights abuses that allegedly flourished under the ousted former President, Marc Ravalomanana. This irony cannot be lost on the long-suffering people of Madagascar, many of whom live in abject poverty. The EU now needs to consider a substantial reinforcement of targeted measures against Rajoelina and his henchmen and cronies and, if necessary, to invoke the Cotonou Agreement’s provisions on failures of governance and to apply the necessary sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The African Union (AU) could do far more. We have heard many platitudes from the AU, but we have seen little concrete action so far. Such action should include brokering an agreement between Rajoelina and Ravalomanana, allowing the former president to return to Madagascar without any risk or prejudice. Rajoelina should also allow his rival to stand in the presidential election planned for September this year.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Things have hardly changed for the people of Madagascar since the resolution in February 2010, except for the worse. They are the focus of my concerns, as they are the main victims. Beyond that, we are now seeing an apparently never-ending power struggle being played out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More than a year ago already, the European Parliament clearly expressed its support for the idea of a democratic process which could lead to elections. That has still not transpired. Rajoelina is still in place. As we restate in this resolution, he must not be able to stand in new elections – that must be made clear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would simply like to ask for the negotiations in progress with the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which have not yet produced a conclusive result, to be given a chance to do so.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, just for once, today, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left can only regret the tone of the resolutions before us. This is particularly true of the resolution on Madagascar. I have already had occasion to deplore this and other resolutions, in February 2010, when the previous urgent resolution on that country was adopted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In that country, as in many others in Africa, the European Union is demonstrating its political impotence, and we are not going to change things by calling for harsher economic sanctions to be imposed on that country. The only victims of the situation are, and will continue to be, the people of Madagascar, who do not need this. We would have preferred it if the European Parliament had sent a clear message of support to the mediator of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), who has worked hard for a year to try to find the most amicable solution possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would have preferred a message congratulating Mr Chissano on his mediation work, which led him to present a road map to the SADC for the resolution of the political crisis in Madagascar. A new meeting of the SADC is to be held in Johannesburg on Saturday in the presence of all the representatives of the different strands of political opinion in Madagascar to ratify this road map.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We wish to make a plea for the people of Madagascar and to reiterate that it is up to them, and them alone, to decide, without international pressure, who governs them. The role of the European Union is to help them. We do not therefore wish to be associated with this partial resolution, which risks adding fuel to the fire instead of supporting the efforts of the SADC, and we refuse to support the imposition of harsher economic sanctions.</p>

We could say that the transition has taken place not to democracy, but to an even deeper crisis than a year and a few months ago. The Southern African Development Community meeting in Gaborone was admittedly presented as a final chance. Unfortunately, we have all seen that it was a failure. I believe that we can retain the hope that during the meeting this weekend, on Saturday, there will still be some positive developments.</p>

In addition, Madagascar was suspended from the Southern African Development Community and the African Union, which contributed to further isolation of the island. The political crisis in Madagascar is just reaching a crucial point, in which there is the opportunity that the negotiations which are in progress between the political leaders will bring about an end to the crisis. This is an ideal opportunity to restore constitutional order and call new elections.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, since the military takeover in March, political instability and a deteriorating humanitarian situation have been becoming ever more obvious features of everyday life for the Madagascans. With the political crisis, they have even more difficulties accessing basic foodstuffs, water, hygiene products and health services.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Those currently in power have illegally monopolised executive, legislative and judicial power, and have taken control of the media. The country’s security services are guilty of violence against ordinary people. Many activists have been imprisoned for political reasons, and former leading political figures have had to flee the country.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The negotiations that are in progress must be stepped up fast, and a way must be sought to restore constitutional order. The human rights violations call for impartial investigation. The EU should increase humanitarian aid for Madagascar, and targeted sanctions should be continued until a solution to the political crisis has been found.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission and Baroness Ashton, the High Representative, are deeply concerned about the situation in Madagascar and we have promised to give our continued support to the people of this beautiful country.</p>
      <p sl="de">We attach great importance to overcoming the ongoing political crisis and the economic and social effects on the population of Madagascar which are increasing the burden placed on the people on a daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the same way as you, the Members of Parliament, we are monitoring developments there very closely and using every diplomatic means at our disposal to bring an end to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">The last two years have involved many retrograde steps and blocks to progress in the country. Now I believe that we have reached a turning point. Two days ago, on 7 June, talks began in Gaborone between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and various players in the country, in order to find a way out of the crisis, which is based on neutrality and consensus, includes all the relevant groups, and can be supported both by the international community and by the broad majority of the citizens of Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are hoping for, counting on and working to ensure the success of the talks, so that the African Union and the international community, including the EU, can help and support Madagascar to return to the rule of constitutional law.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are opposing all attempts to bring about a transition to a one-sided, ‘de facto’ government. For this reason, the European Council decided last week to extend the measures imposed under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement by another six months. This does not affect humanitarian aid or measures to combat poverty, provided that they are compatible with the terms of this article.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are still prepared to provide political and financial support for this transition process, provided it is consensual. It must be based on the road map agreed by the local players and must be endorsed by the SADC, the African Union and the international community. Against this background, I am hoping for positive developments after two tough and difficult years. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="pl">For several months, the whole of Europe has been looking at the situation in the countries of North Africa, watching events which are taking place in our immediate neighbourhood with unconcealed anxiety. Today, we return to the question of another African country, which, for a long time now, has been lost in chaos and political oblivion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madagascar has become a lawless state in which an illegal regime is allowing the country to be plundered and engulfed in chaos. The regime’s repression and disregard for the rights of its own citizens can only aggravate the situation, and this may unfortunately lead to bloodshed. Therefore, although the call for the restoration of constitutional order and the holding of open and free elections under the supervision of the international community may appear to be nothing but demagoguery, it is, in fact, the only way for the situation in Madagascar to return to normal. We must also remember that although sanctions may prove successful, they should go hand in hand with a specific proposal for a solution to the political crisis, because the longer the current situation continues, the harder it will be in the future to bring the rule of law to Madagascar.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group believes that capital punishment is a personal conscience issue for each MEP and, although we acknowledge the EU’s common position opposing execution in all circumstances, the fact of the matter is that many millions of European citizens, our constituents, are still in favour of capital punishment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, this resolution refers to the potential death penalty being imposed on some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, who thought nothing of conspiring to murder thousands of innocent people. Indeed, when reading this resolution, I thought of my own constituents who were mercilessly blown up by al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists in London six years ago. The struggle against global Islamic terrorism is an asymmetric war with unforeseen results and unprecedented consequences, and new jurisprudence internationally is now needed to address this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The detention camp in Guantánamo Bay is a reflection of this tragic situation. It is also a reflection on the fact that the United States is carrying a disproportionate share of the burden for the global war on terror. Of course, all such trials by the US authorities – which, after all, is a country that is a democracy and shares our common values – must nevertheless be conducted fairly with all legal safeguards of due process, and ideally by civilian courts.</p>

    <intervention id="4-225-000" speaker_id="28306" name="Ana Gomes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe stands right against capital punishment. It should be abolished and the EU, particularly the High Representative and the upcoming Polish Presidency, and all the Member States, must firmly demand that the US exclude the death penalty as an option in the first military commission trial for a Guantánamo detainee. The case of the Saudi citizen, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, must set the standard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not only would it be a disgrace to the US human rights record to put him on death row, but it could be totally counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. President Obama is committed to bringing to an end President Bush’s outrageous legacy of running over international law in the name of national security. President Obama has yet to deliver on his promise and to close Guantánamo – an area where EU Member States could and should have assisted him more. But Congress should also help him and press him to reverse this decision to reinstate the military commission system, as it offers no guarantee of a fair trial, and it must also reverse the decision to keep in indefinite detention detainees against whom no charges are brought.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU must be very clear on this: charge them or release them. Mr Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri has been in US custody for nine years and he claims to have been secretly detained by the CIA in a secret detention centre in Poland. The upcoming Polish Presidency of the EU has, therefore, a particular responsibility to bring justice to a man who has been subjected to torture, unlawful detention and now faces an unfair trial before a military tribunal. It is time to set the record right; both in the United States and in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left took the decision not to associate itself with this resolution on Guantánamo. We do not deplore its substance; rather, we find it pretty feeble. For my part, I regret the way in which we worked on drafting this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How cautious we have been in the way we have talked about condemning the human rights violations perpetrated by a country which claims to be the greatest democracy in the world, which still has the death penalty, and for which Guantánamo is an illustration to the world of human rights and international law violations committed in the name of combating terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Men have been held in detention for almost ten years on this part of Cuban territory for the sole purpose of bypassing US legal jurisdiction and in spite of the lack of evidence against some of them. For those men, this is a case of arbitrary detention. Worse still, some of them have been tortured, including on European soil: in Romania, in Lithuania and in Poland. This must not be spoken of, however. We can lecture the entire world on human rights but we are incapable of enforcing them on our own territory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must not even speak of it today, in this resolution! I regret this most sincerely and I do not think that this is how we will promote respect for human rights in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, it is essential to prevent the death sentence being imposed on Mr Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and on many others, but we could have condemned more strongly the position of the United States in this regard, while regretting, at the very least, the change in attitude on the part of President Obama, particularly with regard to military tribunals.</p>

There is the possibility of the death penalty being imposed during the military commission trial on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. I wish to remind you, just as Mr Tannock has also done, that al-Nashiri has been accused of very serious crimes, including involvement in the attacks against a US aircraft carrier and the oil tanker MV Limburg . Our opposition in principle to the death penalty must make us ask the US authorities not to impose the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I would like to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has regarded and does regard a strong transatlantic relationship as a priority, in that this is based on the conviction of the existence of a set of common values and on respect for human rights. We are all united in this Chamber in utterly rejecting acts of terrorism and in expressing our support for the victims of these attacks. However, I regret that a democracy like the United States and dictatorships which Mrs Vergiat is defending explicitly or implicitly are grouped together.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me say that I do not have any animosity towards the US.

I must remind you that Romania is a member of the European Union and I believe that we can at least trust our partners. In fact, I want to remind you that the Romanian authorities have always supplied all the information required in these international inquiries. All the investigators were given access to the airports at Otopeni, Bucharest and Constanţa, as well as to the base at the Torrejón Satellite Centre. Matters were always conducted in an atmosphere of cooperation and there is no way of credibly confirming these actions. I do not really understand why, in this game of slinging the same retorts all the time, you never believe the authorities of a partner state.

I think this issue is a good example of what it means to be consistent with our own principles and values, because this Parliament has spoken out on several occasions against the death penalty, wherever it may occur. It has also spoken on what due process of law means; these two fundamental human rights issues are at stake in the case of al-Nashiri.</p>
      <p sl="en">Due process of law excludes military commissions. We have already criticised this system as it fails, in every respect, to meet international standards on fair trails. Moreover, in this case, the Saudi Arabian national faces the death penalty imposed by a military commission, although in 2009, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions specifically asked the US not to conduct capital prosecutions before military commissions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Oettinger, the current US Government initially spoke out clearly in favour of closing the detention camp at Guantánamo.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, the US Government was not able to follow up on its announcement. This included closing the military commissions set up there because they do not meet any of the standards for fair court proceedings. This makes the fact that there is an imminent death penalty decision and the threat of an execution all the more dramatic. Therefore, our resolution calls urgently on all EU institutions and on the Member States to do everything possible to prevent Mr al-Nashiri from being executed.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are calling again for the USA to impose a moratorium on the death penalty and to join a worldwide movement in which 96 states have made an irreversible decision to abolish the death penalty. The number of states which have retained the death penalty and still make use of it has fallen to 58. This is a positive development.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr al-Nashiri was imprisoned in Poland in a secret prison set up by the CIA where he was subjected to intense torture. We Europeans must finally seriously come to terms with our shared responsibility for these grave violations of human rights. The practice of hushing this up, sweeping it under the carpet and allowing those responsible to remain largely immune from prosecution must not continue. Today’s debate also shows that it is not helpful to talk in superficial terms about anti-Americanism or anti-European sentiments. Instead, we must deal with the facts, including the sources which Mrs Gomez referred to. In addition, the UN special rapporteur on torture submitted a useful document during the last committee meeting which proves that prisons of this kind were established by the CIA in Poland.</p>

      <p sl="de">The subject is far too serious and it has rightly been said that our partnership with the USA is based on human rights. We are fighting in support of the rule of international law. Guantánamo is a zone where national and international law do not apply and, therefore, it goes against the principles of international law. We are fighting against military jurisdiction and for the rule of law, which is not compatible with military jurisdiction. We are fighting for the right to life and this is not compatible with the death penalty. We are fighting for human rights and these human rights are being violated in Guantánamo. Therefore, we must make it quite clear to an important ally, like the USA, that we are not prepared to accept this. This has been Parliament’s position right from the beginning and across all the groups. It has also been the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Guantánamo must be closed. Even terrorists have human rights, but they must, of course, have a legitimate punishment imposed on them in the interests of their victims.

If we allow the erosion of fundamental rights and principles, we will have allowed the terrorists to win. If we act unjustly, we are less credible and even weak.</p>
      <p sl="de">The declaration of the end of the war on terror was one of the first landmarks by President Obama. However, the failure to close Guantánamo Bay is disappointing and we must also look at ourselves in Europe. We are unwilling to take remaining inmates and we must get clarity on the participation in renditions and extrajudicial acts, including torture, on European soil. Yes, we must hold ourselves to the highest standards and open these dark pages of recent EU history. That means we must openly be able to talk about countries involved. Even in this Parliament, that still appears to be difficult.</p>

We generally share core values, but the difference in our position on the death penalty, which I am proud to say is entirely banned in Europe, makes our joint voice less effective and less credible in the world.

This hell-hole must be shut down immediately with all of the current detainees having access to fair trial before a civilian court, all of the secret CIA torture prisons in Europe must be shut down, the use of Shannon airport in Ireland for military and rendition flights by the CIA must be ended, and the barbaric death penalty must be brought to an end.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Guantánamo is important, but let us put it in perspective. The total number of detainees at Guantánamo since it was opened is 775. If you look around this Hemicycle now, there would be room here for all the 775 people that have ever been detained at Guantánamo.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, this Parliament is strongly concerned about individual liberty and the due process of law, and rightly so, but we should recognise that some detainees do present a problem. For example, there was a British citizen who, when arrested on the battlefield in Afghanistan carrying weapons and wearing the black turban of the Taliban, gave the explanation that he was in Afghanistan in order to take a computer course.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s concern for the absolute probity of the legal process at Guantánamo is impressive. However, I put it to the House that the cause of individual liberty under the law in the world would be better served if Parliament took more interest in the operations of the European Arrest Warrant. That European Arrest Warrant, by its nature, outflanks and bypasses legal protections from arbitrary arrest, and 500 million people in Europe are subject to it, while there are now just 171 detainees at Guantánamo.</p>

      <p sl="it">Although my outrage at, and condemnation of, all terrorist attacks and of fundamentalist terrorism remains absolute, I believe it is necessary to call for the abandonment of the death penalty in all cases and in all circumstances.

We refuse to clearly condemn the United States for the criminal attitude it is displaying at Guantánamo. We refuse to acknowledge the responsibility of Member States of the European Union for allowing incarceration and torture in the secret prisons of the CIA.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We refuse to talk about the minors incarcerated and tortured by the United States at Guantánamo despite their being recognised by UNICEF as child soldiers who have been arrested, whereas we would not hesitate to denounce appalling dictatorships and vote for sanctions in other countries. When it comes to ourselves and to the United States, human rights appear to be less of a problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We, for our part, ask for universality of human rights. We also ask that our attitude be guided solely by the desire to serve the people and, in that context, want the United States to be tried for human rights violations, as well as the Member States of the European Union found guilty of complicity. International law must be complied with at all times, and torture and killings in the name of the war against terrorism must be stopped.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, just as the right to life has a very special place among human rights, the death penalty has no place in democratic societies. Today, Europe is the only region in the world where the death penalty has been abolished, with the sad exception of Belarus. I would like to emphasise that the European Union remains strongly committed to the abolition of the death penalty everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that the transatlantic relationship is invaluable to the European Union, as is our mutual cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Still, I would like to take this opportunity to support the call on the United States authorities not to seek the death penalty in the case of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.</p>

I do not think it is about double standards: it is about honesty and being professionally informed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding our subject, the USA is responsible for detainees’ rights and has the moral obligation to abolish capital punishment.

      <p sl="ro">On a different note, I would like to reply to Mr Preda. The fact that we have this stance supporting the abolition of the death penalty does not mean that we undervalue the strategic partnership which we have with the United States and which we want for both the European Union and our countries.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to stress the case of Abd al-Nashiri. He is not only emblematic because of Guantánamo and the death penalty, but also because he is one of the only two named victims of secret detentions in Europe. He has actually been granted victim status in the Polish judicial investigation, together with Abu Zubaydah, and given some concrete hope that the accountability process can move forward in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe it is, therefore, very important that the final resolution includes a clear call for full effective investigation into the European Union Member States’ complicity and their renditions and secret detention programmes. As Amnesty suggested, however, it is vital to link these with the TDIP report and with the follow-up that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has agreed to take up in a new own-initiative report. Work in the European Parliament on the accountability front is absolutely key to keep these issues on the EU agenda.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we have here yet another sorry example of the double standards that are so often evident in this House. What is at issue in this debate is the violation of human rights on the part of the United States authorities, arbitrary and illegal detentions, denial of the right to a fair trial, the practice of torture and capital punishment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Some of these violations were committed with the proven complicity of Member States of the European Union, which placed their territories at the disposal of the CIA. Deplorably enough, however, in the joint motion for a resolution, we do not find a single word of condemnation of the United States authorities or of the European countries that were complicit with them in this activity. Such words are never in short supply when it comes to condemning certain other countries! In this case, demands have been softened into requests and the preferred approach is to emphasise, in the first point of the resolution, the close transatlantic relationship based on shared values and respect for human rights. You can see what this respect amounts to. It is lamentable, but very revealing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, allow me to conclude by saying that, rather than to appeal for the Guantánamo base to be closed, it would be more to the point to call for the restoration of Cuba’s sovereignty over this part of her territory, which is illegally occupied by the United States.</p>

We must, however, make it much clearer that the war against terrorism cannot be waged at the expense of human rights and other basic values.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU has opposed torture and the death penalty for a long time, and this also holds true in the case of al-Nashiri. Two important principles must be borne in mind: an unconditional ‘no’ to the death penalty, and the fact that the war against terrorism must also be a war against the causes of terrorism. As you know, our transatlantic relations are based on values that we have shared for a long time, such as universal human rights and the right to a fair trial. That is why the United States of America must examine its military courts, shut down Guantánamo, and refrain from torture in all cases.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, many fellow Members have spoken of evidence of the existence of detention centres in Poland and Romania and evidence of the use of torture. I would like to make an earnest appeal for this evidence to be given to the Polish prosecution service, because an investigation into this matter is under way in Poland. The service is independent, and is also independent of the government, and the investigation is being monitored by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights. Lawyers acting for two Guantánamo prisoners are involved in the investigation, so if any evidence does exist, it should be placed in the hands of the Polish prosecution service so that it can be examined. In the previous parliamentary term, there was a parliamentary committee which investigated this matter. One of the members of that committee says about this in Poland today that there is evidence, in the form of a document signed by a former socialist prime minister of Poland, and which regulated the question of a detention centre. Asked whether he had seen this document, he said that he had not seen it, but had heard of it. So I hope those people who do have evidence and documents will hand them over, and not just talk about them.</p>

      <p sl="fi">We are categorically opposed to the death penalty, regardless of what crimes the accused may be guilty of. As has been made clear in many speeches here, the charges against al-Nashiri are very serious. He is accused of acts of terrorism in which many dozens of people have been killed. Consequently, it is by means of this resolution that we want to say that we indeed do not accept what he has done. We do not support terrorism, but we want to defend the principle where each person has the right to an impartial trial, and we are pleading in favour of the abolition of the death penalty.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union is working closely together with the United States of America in the war against terror. Nevertheless, we attach a great deal of importance to protecting human rights as part of the process of combating terrorism. In June of last year, we – the EU and the USA – drew up a joint declaration on combating terrorism which states that the war on terror must be in accord with the fundamental values and the principle of the rule of law. The agreement specifies that all court proceedings against terrorist suspects must take place within a proper legal framework which ensures that appropriate procedural law will be followed and guarantees a fair trial which, as far as possible, is accessible to the public and efficiently run.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has been calling for the closure of the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay for many years. We believe that a long imprisonment without trial is not compatible with international law. The EU therefore welcomed the fact that, more than two years ago, President Obama announced and organised the closure of the camp within one year. We have agreed a joint framework with the USA which forms the basis for the release and the admission into the EU Member States of some of the former prisoners. We are still prepared to work closely with the United States on further measures to close the detention camp.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite the decree issued by the President in March of this year in which he officially authorised a longer stay in Guantánamo for some prisoners, the Union hopes – no, in fact, expects – the government of the United States to continue to discuss this subject in Congress and to work towards closing the detention camp as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union and the Member States resolutely oppose the death penalty under all circumstances. We stand up for this viewpoint in the context of our relationships with all the countries of the world. In accordance with the EU guidelines on the death penalty, we are exerting strong pressure on the United States to abolish the death penalty at a national level, and at the level of the US federal states, and we are calling for a pardon in individual cases. We are therefore concerned about those prisoners who could be facing the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="de">We assume that the US authorities have not yet decided whether Muhammed al-Nashiri and the five people accused of complicity in the terrorist attacks 10 years ago can be sentenced to death by the court. I can assure you that the European Union is monitoring the proceedings carefully and will regularly raise its concerns with regard to the death penalty and the fairness of the trial with the US authorities in an appropriate manner.</p>

Indeed, the US authorities will decide by 30 June 2011 whether to support this punishment or not before a military commission which is due to issue a verdict. Terrorism must be condemned and those guilty of this crime must be punished without exception. However, all defendants must enjoy the right to a fair trial. The death penalty does not have a place in a country that defends human dignity, which is at the core of human rights.

It is unacceptable that the United States of America – considered a torchbearer of human rights and democracy – has engaged in ill-treatment and torture of the detainees of the camp. The European Union must insist that the US closes the camp immediately and conducts an independent and impartial investigation of the alleged violations of human rights that have taken place in the camp. The death penalty should not be exercised by any democratic country; therefore, we call on the US authorities not to implement it in the case of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri or any of the other cases. The European Union and its Member States ought to persuade the United States to set a moratorium on the death penalty.

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I want to state that the development of democracy in Ukraine is a priority for us on which we cannot compromise. No doubt should be cast on the Ukrainian people’s achievements either by external or internal factors.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The current government is attempting, by means of a series of initiatives, to improve both the legislative foundation and the effectiveness of the battle against corruption. This is why it must receive encouragement. Removing the Ukrainian elite’s sense of impunity may provide an opportunity for the beneficial reforms which will bring the country closer to the European Union and offer its citizens prospects for the future.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, we currently risk being accused of protecting the leading figures from the previous government with a European political ‘screen’, including former Prime Minister Tymoshenko personally. If we basically expect the Ukrainian Government not to interfere in the work of the independent court and prosecutor’s office, what right does the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have to call today for the European Parliament itself to get involved in such political interference? I cannot accept that we should pardon all the decisions made by the previous government in Ukraine. This is precisely the sense of the text being tabled, which calls, in practical terms, for the individual abuses of power to be concealed behind collective guilt.</p>
      <p sl="bg">A more balanced approach has allowed us to have a joint motion for a resolution today which will be constructive and targeted at the opportunities for closer cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, while judicial reform is carried out in the country and the anti-corruption measures implemented. However, it has been based on an ideological, confrontational approach.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I call for the so-called ‘motion for a joint resolution’ to be rejected and for us to rally support for the proposal from the S&amp;D Group.</p>

Until then, I had no idea that the ministers and prime ministers of some countries enjoyed special lifetime immunity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is unquestionably remarkable that the European Parliament, on the one hand, demands consistent action against corruption but, on the other hand, when former government member Mr Danilishin faces charges, he is granted political asylum, and in the Czech Republic – my own country – at that, without any preliminary investigation of the case. Incidentally, Mr Danilishin has never been a member of any political party, so the charge brought against him is entirely economic in nature.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Let us seek consistent sanctions for corrupt behaviour both inside and outside the European Union. That is entirely proper, but we should read through the constitution of the country concerned, and try to establish the facts. Only when corruption has genuinely been eradicated in European countries should we try reverting to the imperious recommendations granted to various countries in the resolutions adopted, unfortunately, by us.</p>

Anyone who turns the constitutional right of an accused person to access their files into the exact opposite, in other words, into a compulsion to access the files, and anyone who does this, as in the case of Mr Lutsenko, by means of imprisonment and, in the case of Mrs Tymoshenko, by a total of 44 summonses so far, clearly demonstrates what sort of person he is and the fact that he is abusing the judicial system in the old-fashioned way for the purposes of political disputes.</p>

We must stress that respect for these principles is vital to promoting cooperation between the EU and Ukraine, including with a view to signing the Association Agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one of the priorities of the forthcoming Polish Presidency is to strengthen the Eastern Partnership. Ukraine, as Poland’s nearest neighbour, is one of the most important partners and has the opportunity to gain more than the other partners from this situation. While I share the opinion about the necessity of bringing Ukraine closer to the Union, I also think that this must involve the adoption by Ukraine of European standards in the field of the rule of law and transparency in public life. It is with great concern that I have followed the corruption scandals in Ukraine and the trials of politicians who are being accused in a way which is sometimes ludicrous. The Union is being very careful in the way it comments on events in Ukraine. Furthermore, the statement of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Yulia Tymoshenko was exceptionally cautious.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I think that as part of future cooperation between the Union and Ukraine, instruments should be created which, in the longer term, would contribute to a strengthening of the rule of law in Ukraine. I have in mind, here, the idea of creating, for example, an advisory group to help bring Ukrainian law closer to European standards, and assistance in various areas of law, including the training of judges, for example. I think Ukraine’s European aspirations, which, on the one hand, are hedged around with conditions, should, on the other, show a willingness to help in this. I hope the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union will adopt such a stance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ukraine is a democracy. Therefore, we signal our concern to a partner, an ally, and a friend. As we all know, nobody is perfect in this world, but it is in accordance with Europe’s political standards and norms, and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy, that we expect the Ukrainian authorities not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials, and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial, rather than political retribution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government of Ukraine, who had long been the rivals of President Yanukovych, should not be regarded as collectively, or by association, guilty and responsible for what is perceived as a liability in political practice. First and foremost, they are all citizens of a democratic state. By no means are we offering a defence speech here. Instead, we are merely reminding our friends how democracy works.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, six years on from the Orange Revolution, Ukrainian politics remain characterised by rivalry and tension. Former Prime Minister Tymoshenko and some members of the former government that she led are now being pursued through the courts for criminal acts allegedly committed whilst in office. These charges to me have a smell of being politically motivated. I fear that President Yanukovych is trying to neutralise the only Ukrainian political figure with enough gravitas, courage and popularity to challenge his authority. We should not forget that the Orange Revolution was a direct response to Yanukovych’s attempt to steal, by fraud, in 2004 the Presidential election. He was never prosecuted for that crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Tymoshenko has substantial popular support in western Ukraine and carries the hopes of millions of her compatriots with her. It is very curious that the latest charges relating to fraud against the medicines budget were not levelled against Zinovii Mytnyk, the Deputy Minister for Heath at the time, who signed off on the deal, because he has now re-emerged, curiously, as the new Health Minister in Yanukovych’s Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">If Yanukovych wants to reduce Mrs Tymoshenko’s political potency, he should seek to do so in an open and democratic battle of ideas, not through the political manipulation of the justice system. And my question to Mr Vigenin, as the Socialist Group has links to Yanukovych’s Party of the Regions, is: do you have confidence in the political impartiality of the General Prosecutor’s Office in Ukraine? Mr Vigenin, could you answer that?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Ukraine’s political scene is characterised by a gubernatorial style of leadership, deeply rooted in the former Soviet era. Even those who led the Orange Revolution, President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Tymoshenko, exhibited some peculiar political behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Indeed, it is an open secret in Ukraine and abroad that the real cause of the gas crisis that descended on us in early 2009 was a rift between the family clans of Prime Minister Tymoshenko and President Yushchenko, as they fought to control the profits from the transport of gas. I agree that exploiting the baseless criminalisation of political opponents in order to repress opposition forces is unacceptable, but I find it highly presumptuous to claim that none of Tymoshenko’s team put a foot wrong during their chaotic period in government.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Tymoshenko’s group lost the elections precisely because ordinary people had had enough of widespread corruption and the theft of public property by certain public officials.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Therefore, if we really want to help Ukraine to develop an open, democratic society, we should concentrate on systemic recommendations and not tell them that those senior officials who may be endearing to some of you or with whom you may be friends should be treated any differently from other criminal suspects. Indeed, here in the European Union, we also say that all are equal, and that includes equality before the law.</p>

Such persecutory practices belonged to the arsenal of totalitarian communist regimes in the last century, and those EU citizens who lived under those regimes are particularly sensitive to this. We see this as yet another abuse of public power to discredit political opponents, which is absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society. I draw attention to the fact that this fundamentally challenges the independence of the Ukrainian judiciary in the eyes of the world.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Under these circumstances, I appeal to EU Member States to join the Czech Republic in standing ready to grant political asylum to persecuted Ukrainian opposition politicians and to consider sanctions against Ukraine for violations of international law, if the situation in Ukraine does not change.</p>

However, we must learn the lessons of this situation, and lessons must be learned, above all, by the authorities in Ukraine. A condition for building a normal democratic system in Ukraine is respect for the rights of the opposition, and we must say this very clearly from here, today. However, in this Chamber, we must also say something very clearly to ourselves. This is the experience of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and also East Germany. There can be no real modernisation in this part of Europe if we cannot say that for Ukrainians, and not for this or that authority, there is a place in Europe. Perhaps not today, perhaps not in several years, but that perspective does exist. Without talking clearly about that perspective – and I am talking to all friends from every part of Europe – we are, in fact, going to be working together to maintain badly functioning democratic systems in the East. Do not be under any illusions about this. It is a very simple matter. So, as well as holding this debate, we also have something else to do – to say clearly: the door is open, do not worry.</p>

This is indeed the case, and this is how we should treat our friends in Kiev. I would like to ask everyone a question. I have similar comments and I share the quandary of most of you who have spoken, today. I, too, am not satisfied by the way human rights are being observed and by how democracy is functioning in Kiev, but what have you done – what has this House done, and what have all those who have today, with such high principles, condemned the situation with Mrs Tymoshenko – what have you done to send a clear signal to Kiev and other cities of Ukraine that we are their friends and allies, that we are waiting for them, and that this House should one day be enlarged by the presence of Ukrainian Members? I ask this because respect for human rights and respect for democracy in Ukraine are, to a large extent, dependent on us. I must ask you to understand this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the road to democracy is often a slow and tortuous one. Some countries move quicker than others and we see that with the countries of the former Soviet Union, who are now our valid colleagues here in the European Parliament.</p>

In particular, to establish true democracy, it needs, first of all, to promote civil society, secondly, end state control, particularly over NGOs, thirdly, have a truly independent judiciary, and fourthly, have a free and strong opposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">You cannot have proper democracy without having a free, strong and vibrant opposition. We in the European Union must use every means to encourage Ukraine to go the full circle and establish true democracy. It has made progress, but it needs to go a bit further.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Ukraine is a democracy, a friendly country, a partner of this European Union. However, Ukraine must adopt European standards also in the administration of judicial power, which is characterised by politicised trials in which the accused do not enjoy all the rights and means necessary to face a trial that, in some cases, is a purely political trial. This represents a criminalisation of political opponents of the government in office, aimed solely at eliminating and silencing the opposition. Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister, and her ministers are being attacked by means of show trials, rather than by a political confrontation which, although heated, would be serious and transparent. The Ukrainian Government must respect the opposition, without brandishing the weapon of judicial power, and respect the rules of a democratic state and human rights, as subscribed to in the Eastern Partnership agreements.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The background and context, however, beg awkward questions and arouse concern regarding the partly politically motivated nature of the charges. Our resolution rightfully raises the issue of the charges against the leaders of the political opposition, charges that look ever more selective in nature, and insists on a guarantee of the transparency of the investigations and of the judicial process.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The fight against corruption and the affirmation of the rule of law are not just preconditions for deepening EU-Ukraine relations: they are also crucial for reinforcing Ukraine’s democratic development.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the motion for a resolution relating to the case of the members of the former Ukrainian Government is needed to ensure respect for the basic principles of the European Union, starting with respect for human rights. It is not Ukraine’s justice system which is the biggest concern, but the possible interference of politics in the administration of justice. The European Union, as a community of law and values, must support the members of the former Ukrainian Government to ensure respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to highlight the need to continue and step up the reforms being carried out in Ukraine and to align its legislation with the EU’s provisions and obligations as key elements aimed at bringing it closer to the European Union. The success of the reform process taken on by Ukraine will depend on the promotion of, and respect for, democratic principles, the rule of law and transparency. With regard to the charges made against Yulia Tymoshenko and the members of the former government, an abuse of power cannot be used to take action against an accusation of an abuse of power. Democracy must make progress in Ukraine and we can support this process.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is following developments in Ukraine with regard to the former members of the government of Ukraine, Mrs Tymoshenko, Mr Lutsenko and others very closely, as Parliament and the parliamentary groups are also doing. Since the beginning of the year, we have been making clear our concerns about the possible political motivation that lies behind these cases. The EU has a delegation in the country and is monitoring developments carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">The progress report on Ukraine which we published a few days ago gives a comprehensive picture of the situation in the country last year. Our evaluation of the situation, which has not changed, shows the need for comprehensive reform of the justice system and for measures to combat corruption. The report emphasises that respect for the rule of law in criminal investigations and criminal prosecutions and fair, impartial and independent court proceedings must be guaranteed, in order to ensure that criminal law is not abused for political purposes.</p>
      <p sl="de">In cases involving former members of the government, a clear distinction must be made between criminal and political responsibility. The concerns about the excessive use of detention and custody measures and of travel restrictions also give the impression of an arbitrary approach to justice.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, a large part of Ukrainian civil society, experts throughout the world and foreign businesspeople working in Ukraine are firmly convinced that the courts in Ukraine are being subjected to strong pressure from different sides. We are hoping that future amendments to the law on the reform of the judicial system will take into consideration the statement by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe and sweep away these concerns.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to emphasise that we attach great importance to safeguarding the rule of law in Ukraine, which is a country that we want to enter into a closer contractual relationship with on the basis of association and economic integration. A smoothly functioning, independent and transparent justice system is essential in order for this to happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do not want to take sides in any individual cases, but we expect Ukraine to bring about fundamental changes in its system in order to guarantee impartial, fair and transparent court proceedings. We are convinced that the stability of Ukraine and the confidence of its citizens in the country’s public bodies will depend on the progress made in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">The speed and the scope of our integration with Ukraine, and vice versa, will depend on whether Ukraine can fully guarantee its respect for human rights, the principles of democracy and the principles of the rule of law. These principles must not be called into question in any way. This conclusion is in line with the results of the review of the European neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The meeting of the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council which is taking place in the course of the next few weeks will give us the opportunity to discuss numerous issues that are important for our relationship and to send clear signals to Ukraine which are the same as those that you are sending about the importance of reform in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are pleased about Ukraine’s determination to conclude the negotiations on an association agreement before the end of this year. So far, so good. However, Ukraine must implement the necessary far-reaching reforms, in particular, of the judicial system, the electoral system and the constitution, in order to be able to enjoy the opportunities which this agreement can offer with regard to association and economic integration with the EU. In addition, the country must make more decisive efforts to combat corruption.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ukraine is not alone in this respect, but it must demonstrate its unconditional determination to introduce more comprehensive and more inclusive reforms if it wants to move closer to the EU. We will continue to provide Ukraine with significant support in its efforts to bring about internal reforms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say that we will make clear our absolute respect for proper court proceedings, without passing comment. We are relying on being able to continue our open and transparent dialogue in Kiev and in Brussels about internal reforms in Ukraine and about the country’s closer integration with the EU, both with the Ukrainian authorities and with the opposition. Thank you very much.</p>

It is known that the European People’s Party has a cooperation agreement with the bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko. It would be interesting to know whether there is in the agreement a point on legal protection and provision of lawyer services?</p>

      <p sl="pl">The priorities of the Ukrainian Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe are, inter alia , to prevent violations of human rights and to uphold the principles of the rule of law. Ukraine has also undertaken to build democracy at local level and to strengthen local self-government. At the same time, the Helsinki Committee is warning that Ukraine is breaching the European Convention on Human Rights. The preventative detentions and the ban on leaving the country which has been imposed on the most important members of the opposition and former members of the government cast doubt on the objectivity of the Ukrainian prosecution service. In the opinion of the European Parliament, there is a lack of transparency in the investigation, and the procedural methods adopted are out of proportion. The European Parliament should ask the Ukrainian Prosecutor General to lift this ban.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The real problem, however, lies in the continued lack of democratic reform in Ukraine. During the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe in March 2011, the Ukrainian representatives explained that more time is needed to shake off the Communist past. I think, too, that achieving democracy is not easy, but requires the will to introduce change and take forceful steps. Enough time has already passed since the fall of the USSR, and other post-Communist countries have made significant progress. To create a pluralistic system of the rule of law, Ukraine must start by efficiently making changes to its electoral law and criminal legislation. The European Union must, however, insist that the demands it is making are met, chiefly because it is itself offering a great deal in the Eastern Partnership and Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
