      <p sl="unknown">I declare the sitting open. We have an important debate today, namely the statement by the President of the Commission on the State of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">After yesterday’s discussion with the President of the Euro Group and Prime Minister of Luxembourg Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, which was very important for all of us, this is another debate which is going to give us a greater insight into the best solutions for the Union today and provide answers to the most important questions. So we in Parliament are treating this debate very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Welcome to the President of the European Commission, Mr José Manuel Barroso, the Vice-Presidents who are present with us, the full college of Commissioners, and representatives of the Polish Presidency. Minister Dowgielewicz is also with us.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I give the floor to the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-008-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission. President of the Commission. President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Dowgielewicz, we need to be honest and absolutely clear in the analysis of the state of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are currently facing the greatest challenge that our Union has ever faced, I believe, in its entire history. This is a financial, economic and social crisis, but also a confidence crisis; a confidence crisis both in relation to our leaders in general, to Europe itself, and in relation to our ability to find solutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The causes of the crisis are known: Europe has not met the challenges of competitiveness. Some of our Member States have lived above their means. In the financial markets, there has been irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour. We have let the gap widen between our Member States, particularly in the euro area. What is more, the shocks that have shaken the international order and the pressures of globalisation have made the situation even worse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The outcome is there to be seen: our societies are deeply concerned. Many of our citizens fear for the future. There is like never before a danger of national withdrawal, or even nationalistic withdrawal. Populist responses bring into question the European Union’s great successes: the euro, the single market, even the free movement of people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think we can safely say that the sovereign debt crisis is now first and foremost a political crisis of confidence. Our citizens, but also the outside world, are watching us and are asking themselves: Are we really a Union? Do we really have the will to support the single currency? Are the most vulnerable Member States determined to implement essential reforms? Are the most prosperous Member States really committed to showing solidarity? Is Europe really able to achieve growth and create jobs?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am telling you now: yes, this is a serious situation, but there are solutions to this crisis. Europe does have a future, provided we restore confidence. And to restore confidence, we need stability, growth, but also political will on the part of political leaders. We must work together to present our citizens with a European revival.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">We now need to make a reality of what we concluded in the Berlin Declaration, signed by the Commission, Parliament and the European Council at the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome – at the time, we said …</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘Today we live together as was never possible before. We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘Today we live together, as never was possible before. We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better.’ This is a declaration, and the words count. We must live out this will in the courage of each day. With our institutions, and not against them, we can succeed. We know that some see the need for stability as paramount. For others, it is growth. I say to you: we need both. Some preach discipline, others solidarity. We need both. We can no longer have ad hoc or partial solutions. We must be determined in finding comprehensive solutions, we must have a greater ambition for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I really believe that we are currently at a turning point in our history, a time when, if we do not move forward with integration, we run the risk of fragmentation. Therefore, this is a matter of political will, an ‘ordeal by fire’ for our entire generation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, it is possible to end this crisis. Not only is it possible, but it is necessary. Herein lies political leadership: making possible that which is necessary.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Let me start with Greece. Greece is and will remain a member of the euro area.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Greece must implement its commitments in full and on time. In turn, the other euro area members have pledged to support Greece and each other. As stated at the Euro Area Summit on 21 July: ‘We are determined to continue to provide support to countries under programmes until they have regained market access, provided they successfully implement those programmes.’ That is why I created the Task Force for Greece. We have just launched an action plan based on two major pillars: around 100 viable and high-quality projects, investing in all Greek regions, to make the best use of Greece’s remaining allocation of the Structural Funds, and a major drive to reduce bureaucratic procedures for European co-funded projects. EUR 15 billion remain to be spent in Greece from the Structural Funds. This will support the Greek economy with an urgent programme of technical assistance to the Greek administration. A programme of EUR 500 million to guarantee European Investment Bank loans to Greek SMEs is already under way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is also considering a wider guarantee mechanism to help banks start lending again to the real economy. All of this represents huge support for Greece’s fight-back and Greece will have to deliver concrete results. It must break with counter-productive practices and resist vested interests. But we have to be clear about this. This is not a sprint, but a marathon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The task of building a Union of Stability and Responsibility is not only about Greece. The economic outlook that we face is very difficult. We are confronted with the negative effects of an ongoing global reassessment of risks. It is therefore our responsibility to rebuild confidence and trust in the euro and our Union as a whole. We can do this by showing that we are able to take all the decisions needed to run a single currency and an integrated economy in a competitive, inclusive and resource-efficient way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For this we need to act in the short, the medium and the long term. Let us start with the short term. The first step is to quickly fix the way we respond to the sovereign debt crisis. This will require stronger mechanisms for crisis resolution. We need credible firepower and effective firewalls for the euro. We have to build on the EFSF and the upcoming European Stability Mechanism. The EFSF must immediately be made both stronger and more flexible. This is what the Commission proposed already in January. This is what Heads of State or Government of the euro area agreed upon on 21 July. Only then, when you ratify this, will the EFSF be able to deploy precautionary intervention; to intervene to support the recapitalisation of banks and intervene in the secondary markets to help avoid contagion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once the EFSF is ratified, we should make the most efficient use of its financial envelope. The Commission is working on options to this end. Moreover we should do everything possible to accelerate the entry into force of the ESM. Naturally we trust that the European Central Bank – in full respect of the Treaty – will do whatever is necessary to ensure the integrity of the euro area and to ensure its financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But we cannot stop there. We must deepen economic coordination and integration, particularly in the euro area. This is at least as big a political task as an economic one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, you will vote on the ‘six-pack’ proposals that we have put before you and the Council one year ago. This ‘six pack’ reforms the Stability and Growth Pact and widens surveillance to macroeconomic balances. We are now back very close to what the Commission originally put on the table. You have played a decisive role in keeping the level of ambition of these proposals, and I really want to thank you and congratulate you for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This legislation will give us much stronger enforcement mechanisms. We can now discuss Member States’ budgetary plans before national decisions are taken. This mix of discipline and integration holds the key to the future of the euro area. Only with more integration and discipline can we have a really credible euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are indeed important steps forward, but we must go further. We need to complete our monetary union with an economic union. We need to achieve the tasks of Maastricht. It was an illusion to think that we could have a single currency and a single market with national approaches to economic and budgetary policy. Let us avoid another illusion that we can have a single currency and a single market with an intergovernmental approach.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">For the euro area to be credible – and this is not only the message of the federalists, this is the message of the markets – we need a truly Community approach. We need to really integrate the euro area; we need to complete the monetary union with a real economic union. And this truly Community approach can be built how? In the coming weeks, the Commission will build on the ‘six pack’ and present a proposal for a single, coherent framework to deepen economic coordination and integration, particularly in the euro area. This will be done in a way that ensures the compatibility between the euro area and the Union as a whole. Of course, we do not want the euro area to break the great acquis of the single market and all our four freedoms. At the same time, we can pool decision-making to enhance our competitiveness. This could be done by integrating the Euro Plus Pact into this framework, in full respect of the national implementation competences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For all of this to work, we need more than ever the independent authority of the Commission to propose and assess actions that the Member States should take. Governments, let us be frank, cannot do this by themselves. Nor can this be done by negotiations between governments. Indeed, within the Community competences, the Commission is the economic government of the Union; we certainly do not need more institutions for this.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">For the same reason the Treaties have created supranational institutions. For the same reason the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the Court of Justice of the European Union were created. The Commission is the guarantor of fairness. Moreover, the Commission, which naturally works in partnership with the Member States, is voted by and accountable to this House, the directly elected Parliament both of the euro area and of the European Union as a whole.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">It is also time to have unified external representation of the euro area. In accordance with the Treaty the Commission will make proposals for this purpose. A Union of Stability and Responsibility built on this basis and with a common approach will also allow the Member States to seize fully the advantages of a bigger market for the issuance of sovereign debt. Once the euro area is fully equipped with the instruments necessary to ensure both integration and discipline, the issuance of joint debt will be seen as a natural and advantageous step for all, on condition that such eurobonds will be ‘stability bonds’, bonds that are designed in a way that rewards those who play by the rules and deters those who do not. As I already announced to this House, the Commission will present options for such ‘stability bonds’ in the coming weeks. Some of these options can be implemented within the current Treaty, whereas fully fledged eurobonds would require Treaty change. This is important because, we can do a lot within the existing Treaty of Lisbon. And there is no excuse for not doing it, and for not doing it now, but it may be necessary to consider further changes to the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also thinking particularly of the constraint of unanimity. The pace of our joint endeavour cannot be dictated by the slowest. Today we have a Union where it is the slowest member that dictates the speed of all the other Member States. This is also not credible from the markets’ point of view; this is why we need to solve this problem of decision-making. A Member State has of course the right not to accept decisions. That is a question, as they say, of national sovereignty, but a Member State does not have the right to block the moves of others; the others also have their national sovereignty and, if they want to go further, they should go further.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Our willingness to envisage Treaty change should not be a way or an excuse to delay the reforms that are necessary today, but I believe that this longer-term perspective will reinforce the credibility of our decisions now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A Union of Stability and Responsibility means swiftly completing the work on a new system of regulation for the financial sector. We need well capitalised, responsible banks lending to the real economy. Much has been said about the alleged vulnerability of some of our banks. European banks have substantially strengthened their capital positions over the past year. They are now raising capital to fill the remaining gaps identified by the stress tests in summer. This is necessary to limit the damage of financial market turbulence on the real economy and on jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over the last three years, we have designed a new system of financial regulation. Let us remember, we have already tabled 29 pieces of legislation. You have already adopted several of them, including the creation of independent supervising authorities, which are already working. Now it is important to approve our proposals for new rules on derivatives, naked short selling and credit default swaps, fair remuneration for bankers. These propositions are there; they should be adopted by the Council and by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will deliver the remaining proposals by the end of this year, namely rules on credit rating agencies, bank resolution and personal responsibility of financial operatives. So we will be the first constituency in the G20 to have delivered on our commitment to global efforts for financial regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the last three years, Member States – I should say taxpayers – have granted aid and provided guarantees of EUR 4.6 trillion to the financial sector. It is time for the financial sector to make a contribution back to society.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I am very proud to say that today the Commission adopted a proposal for the Financial Transaction Tax.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Today I am putting before you a very important text that if implemented may generate revenue of about EUR 55 billion per year. Some people will ask ‘Why?’. Why? It is a question of fairness. If our farmers, if our workers, if all the sectors of the economy, from industry to agriculture to services, pay a contribution to society, the banking sector should also give a contribution to society.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">And if we need – because we need – fiscal consolidation, if we need more revenues, the question is where these revenues are coming from. Are we going to tax labour more? Are we going to tax consumption more? I think it is fair to tax financial activities that in some of our Member States do not pay the proportionate contribution to society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But it is not only financial institutions who should pay a fair share. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to tax evasion. So it is time to adopt our proposals on savings tax within the European Union, and I call on the Member States to finally give the Commission the mandate we have asked for to negotiate tax agreements for the whole European Union with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Stability and responsibility are not enough on their own. We need stability, but we also need growth. We need responsibility, but we also need solidarity. The common economy can only remain strong if it delivers growth and jobs. That is why we must unleash the energy of our economy, especially the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The forecasts today point to a strong slowdown, but significant growth in Europe is not an impossible dream. It will not come magically tomorrow, but we can create the conditions for growth to resume. We have done it before. We must and we can do it again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that we do not have much room for a new fiscal stimulus. But that does not mean that we cannot do more to promote growth. First, those who have fiscal space available must explore it – but in a sustainable way. Second, all Member States need to promote structural reforms so that we can increase our competitiveness in the world and promote growth. Together, we can and must tap the potential of the Single Market, exploit all the benefits of trade and mobilise investment at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me start with the Single Market. Full implementation of the Services Directive alone could, according to our estimates, deliver up to EUR 140 billion in economic gains, but today, two years after the deadline for implementation, several Member States have still not adopted the necessary laws so we are not benefiting from all the possible gains from having a true services liberalisation in Europe. But we can also do more. We must adopt what is on the table. We have adopted the Single Market Act in the European Commission. A number of key initiatives are ready. We are close to having a European patent which would cut the cost of protection to 20% of current costs. I expect this to be concluded by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, for the Single Market Act, we should consider a fast-track legislative procedure. By the way, in many areas we should follow a fast-track legislative procedure because we are living in real emergency times. This will allow us to respond to these extraordinary circumstances. Growth in the future will depend more and more on harnessing information technology. We need a digital single market, which will benefit each and every European by around EUR 1 500 per year by using the possibilities of e-commerce to end for instance mobile roaming charges. An extra 10% in broadband penetration would bring us between 1 and 1.5% of extra annual growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a competitive world we must be also well-educated, with skills to face these new challenges. We must innovate and we must act in a sustainable way. We have already presented detailed proposals on innovation, resource-efficiency and how we can strengthen our industrial base. Modern industrial policy is about investing in research and innovation. We need to accelerate the adoption of our efforts to boost the use of venture capital to fund young, innovative companies across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sustainable jobs will come if we focus on innovation and new technologies, including green technologies. We must see that ‘green’ and growth go together. For example, the renewables sector has already created 300 000 jobs in the past five years in the European Union. The global green technology market will triple over the next decade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must focus our action on where it makes a real impact. Growth in the future means we must actively pursue also our smart regulation agenda, which will give a saving of EUR 38 billion for European companies, particularly for SMEs, but Member States must also do their part in reducing the administrative burden. But we also need investment. These reforms are important, but we also need some kind of investment at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A Union of Growth and Solidarity needs modern, interconnected infrastructures. We have proposed for the next MFF (Multiannual Financial Framework) to create a facility to connect Europe – in energy, in transport, in digital. This innovative part of our MFF proposal has to be seen together with another very important innovative idea: the project bond. In the coming weeks the Commission will publish its proposals for EU project bonds. We are also proposing pilot projects, so that we can frontload growth. We can do it even before the MFF is adopted. In this way we can frontload some of the major infrastructure investments Europe needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union and its Member States should urgently consider how to allow our own policy-driven bank, the European Investment Bank, to do more – possibly much more – to finance long-term investment. To do so, we need to explore ways to reinforce the EIB’s resources and capital base so that it can lend to the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the year 2000 there was EUR 22 billion of venture capital in Europe. In 2010 there was only 3 billion. If we want to promote entrepreneurship we must reverse this decline and we need that support namely for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can also get more growth out of the Structural Funds, by increasing absorption capacity, using the Structural Funds to support macroeconomic performance. They are essential for innovation, for training, employment, and for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to urge this House to adopt by the end of the year the proposals we made in August to increase cofinancing rates to those countries with assistance programmes. This will inject essential funding into these economies, while reducing pressure on national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Reforms to our labour markets, public finances and pension systems require a major effort from all parts of society. We all know these changes are necessary, so that we can reform our social market economy and keep our social model, but it is imperative that we hold on to our values – the values of fairness, of inclusiveness and of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Right now we need to give concrete hope to the one in five of our young people who cannot find work. In some countries, the situation of our young people is dramatic. I want to call on companies to make a special effort to provide internships and apprenticeships for young people. These can be supported by the European Social Fund. By getting businesses, the social partners, national authorities and the European Union level involved in a Young Opportunities Initiative, we can make a difference. This I believe is the most urgent social matter: to respond to the anxiety of our young people who cannot find a job. It is much better to have an apprenticeship, a traineeship, than to take their anxieties onto the streets expressing their lack of confidence in the Union as a whole.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">We must accelerate the most urgent parts of our Growth and Jobs Plan, Europe 2020. The Commission will focus on the situation of young people in each and every Member State in its country-specific recommendations for next year. I believe we must give our future a real chance. But right now we also need to act to help the 80 million Europeans at risk of poverty. This means that the Council must finally approve our proposal to safeguard the programme for the supply of food for the most deprived persons.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank this Parliament for the political support it has given to our proposed solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fifty years ago, 12 countries in Europe came together to sign the Social Charter. To be precise, it was in October 50 years ago. Today, the Charter has 47 signatories, including all our Member States. To guarantee these fundamental values in Europe, I believe we need to boost the quality of social dialogue at European level. The renewal of Europe can only succeed with the input and the ownership of all the social partners – of trade unions, of workers, of business, civil society in general.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should remember that our Europe is a Europe of citizens. As citizens, we all gain through Europe. We gain a European identity and citizenship apart from our national citizenship. European citizenship adds a set of rights and opportunities – the opportunity to freely cross borders, to study, to work abroad. Here again, we must all stand up and preserve and develop these rights and opportunities, just as the Commission is doing now with our proposals on Schengen. We will not tolerate a rolling-back of our citizens’ rights. We will defend the freedom of movement and all the freedoms in our Union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, the Commission works in many other areas, as you are aware.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I cannot mention them all here, but you can find them in the letter that I sent to the President of the European Parliament and that you will have all received. Nonetheless, before concluding, let me talk about the European Union’s external responsibility. I want an open Europe, a Europe that is involved in the world. European action in the world is not only the best guarantee for our citizens, for defending our interests and values, but it is also much-needed in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These days it is trendy to talk about the G2. I think that the world does not want a G2. Even the two in question would not find it beneficial to have a G2. We know that a bipolar world brought about tension during the cold war. I believe that Europe is more than ever indispensable, if we want a just and open world. I believe the changing world we are living in needs a Europe that assumes its responsibilities. An influential Europe, a Europe of 27, and soon with Croatia’s accession, a Europe of 28. A Europe that continues to lead the way, whether in terms of trade or climate change, at a time when we are coming up to major events: from Durban to Rio+20. Europe must hold on to its leadership on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us also turn our eyes and our attention to our southern neighbours. The Arab spring represents a deep transformation that will have far-reaching consequences, not only for the people in those countries, but also for us, for our Europe. That is why Europe should be proud. We were the first to stand alongside the Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans who wanted democracy and freedom. That is why Europe supports these legitimate aspirations, particularly through our partnership for democracy and for prosperity. The Arab spring, I hope, also opens the door to the hope of peace for the whole region, to the idea of a Palestinian State that must live in peace with the State of Israel, which is what Europe would like to see.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Let us also turn our eyes and our attention to our eastern neighbours. This Friday I will be attending the Eastern Partnership Summit in Warsaw. I shall go there with the following ambition: closer political relations and closer economic integration between us and our partners in the region. The European Union has an extraordinary power of transformation and inspiration for many around the world. Furthermore, if these countries undertake deeper reforms, we can help them and involve them in a closer way, from a political point of view, and we can also achieve closer integration with them from an economic point of view.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, let us not abandon the poorest of the poor and let us live up to our commitments to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Let us also be realistic and let us recognise that, for Europe to be fully influential, for Europe to be a real power, we need to strengthen the common foreign and security policy. It must be credible. It must be based on a common dimension for security and defence, if we really want to count in the world. Gone is the time when some people were able to argue that the idea of European defence could harm the Atlantic Alliance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are already aware: at present, it is the Americans themselves who are asking us to do more as Europeans. The world has changed, the world is changing in a fundamental way. Do we really want to count in the world? That is why, at a time when defence budgets are under pressure, we need to do more together, with the resources that we have. In this respect, the Commission is taking its share of responsibility by continuing the efforts towards a single market in the area of defence and by drawing on the competences granted by the Treaty in order to develop a European industrial base for defence. Honourable Members, let us not be naive, the world is transforming, and if Europe wants to count in the world and defend the interests of its citizens, if it wants to count and influence the world’s future, it needs a political dimension and a defence dimension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, I shall conclude. At the end of our mandate, the mandate of this Parliament, in 2014, it will be exactly one century that the Great War broke out on this continent, a dark period followed by the Second World War, one of the most tragic pages of European and world history. Today, I think that we can safely say that such horrors are unthinkable in Europe. To a large extent, this is the case because we have the European Union. Because, thanks to the European vision and thanks to economic and political integration, we have succeeded in ensuring peace on our continent.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we cannot let this great achievement be endangered. We have received it from the previous generations. Our generation will not be the one to undermine it. Let us be clear: if we start to fragment Europe, if we start to go back on ourselves, on Europe’s great successes, our objective will undoubtedly run the risk of fragmentation. As I have said, at the root of the crisis we are currently experiencing, there is a political problem. It is our will to live together that is being tested. That is why we must take the European Union to a deeper level. That is why we have built common institutions. That is why we must protect European interest. And today’s reality is that intergovernmental cooperation is not enough to get Europe out of this crisis, to provide Europe with a future. On the contrary, I have to tell you quite frankly: a certain amount of intergovernmentalism could well lead to renationalisation, to fragmentation. A certain amount of intergovernmentalism could well sign the death warrant of a united Europe, as we would want it.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not forget that the decisions we take or do not take today will impact on our future. There is one thing that I would like to admit to you: I feel really offended when I see some people, elsewhere in the world, telling us Europeans, with a fair amount of paternalism, what we need to do. I honestly believe that, while we have problems, very serious problems, we do not have to apologise for our democracy. We do not have to apologise for our social market economy. Therefore I think that we need to claim from our institutions, but also from our Member States, in Paris, Berlin, Athens, Lisbon, Dublin, a burst of pride about being European, a burst of dignity. We should answer our partners like this: ‘Thank you for your advice, but we are capable of working together. We are capable of overcoming this crisis.’ I want this pride in being European.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">And the pride in being European is not only being proud of our great culture, our great civilisation, everything that we have given to the world; it is not being proud of our past only, but also of our future. It is that trust that we need to recreate between us. I believe that it is possible. Some say: ‘It is very difficult, it is not possible’. In response, I would like to quote a great man, a great African, Nelson Mandela: ‘It always seems impossible, until it is done. Let’s do it.’ We can do it, we can do it with confidence, we can achieve the revival of our Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, it is heart-warming to hear such a speech. Like you, I may give an analysis, but after this speech, we will act together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe is going through a confidence crisis and a growth crisis. As if that was not enough, it is going through a leadership crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is high time that Europe came up with a political answer to the crisis. A united and strong answer, which puts politics in its rightful place, that is to say in the driving seat; I am talking to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Because, after all, what are we talking about? We are talking about a currency – the euro – created 10 years ago. We truly believe that we are giving ourselves the means to secure its governance. We talk about countries which, for decades, have lived above their means, always more, without wondering whether or not the money spent actually created growth and jobs. We talk about a Europe born to prevent internal conflicts and to ensure its peoples’ prosperity, a Europe that, until now, has succeeded on all these fronts. But we also talk about a Europe that is misunderstood, even criticised, because its leaders have not been able to explain why the choice of Europe is the only choice for the future and why the answer to global challenges can only be a European one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All too often, one forgets that the European Union is one of the most advanced and developed regions. It is the world’s leading power in terms of trade. Our duty is above all to make sure that it remains in that position. What is the problem, then? And how can it be solved? The problem is that, even though economists agree on the reasons behind the financial and economic crisis, and on how to respond to it – namely a mix of rigour and incentives for creating wealth and employment – the political class has not had the courage to set about the task.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The reforms proposed these last few months by the Member States of the Union and of the euro area, in particular, are along the right lines. However, they are clearly insufficient, late and poorly explained, or not explained at all. They stem from the intergovernmental method which – it is plain to see – paralyses Europe, as you rightly said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The national approach, ladies and gentlemen, must give way to the European approach. We do not want to discuss subsidiarity here, but the Community approach is the only one that will enable us to meet in a united and effective way the urgent and huge challenges that are before us. I can understand that, in times of crisis, one feels the need to turn in on oneself. No, we must reach out and seek the Community approach. The European method is not two, three or four Presidents bringing different messages, but a single and swift exit strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, you are the head of the executive for economic governance. You demonstrated it this morning in your speech. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) urges you to fully play your double role of proposing and implementing European legislation decided with the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has a crucial role to play: that of guarantor of the European general interest. This is difficult and demanding, but necessary: we must resist national interests which are not always compatible with the common interest.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">This is essential. That is why this Parliament placed its trust in you at the beginning of the mandate and continues to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, I ask you to go even further in your ambitions, because there is urgency. There is urgency to save the euro, to demonstrate our solidarity towards Greece and towards all the member countries that are seeing their markets attacked and their rating downgraded. At the same time, it is urgent that these same countries adopt and implement measures that are a match for the events, for European solidarity comes at that price. We must act urgently, not in the months, but in the days and weeks to come, to prove to the world that Europeans are able to defend and stabilise their currency. If they do not do it, the whole European project will suffer in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The decision that – I hope – this Parliament will take today on economic governance, the famous ‘six pack’, is an important step in the right direction. We now have to apply it as soon as possible, and the same goes for the decisions of 21 July on the stability funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, entrepreneurs need visibility and security. The markets expect the euro area and the countries of the Union as a whole to take strong and consistent measures for reducing expenditure but also for supporting growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the first aspect – that of streamlining public expenditure – a few days ago I called for a ‘big bang’, a common decision of the 17 on fiscal, budgetary and social convergence. I reiterate this call today. It is very difficult for one country in isolation to take the strong measures that the euro area’s financial situation requires. However, we must recognise that the election campaigns that are coming up in several European countries in the next few years will undoubtedly not be conducive to courageous measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, I ask the Commission to seize the proposal to bring into line tax rates, particularly for businesses, but also retirement age and weekly working time. Europeans will only stand shoulder to shoulder with each other if they see the same rules applied. That is when we can feel European.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that strong and swift decisions by the 17 on this triple convergence would have considerable impact and would be a tangible sign of leadership on Europe’s part.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I said this earlier on: the current crisis is as much a crisis of confidence, which calls for collective decisions like those I have just described, as it is a growth crisis. And without growth, Europe will be unable to reimburse even the interest on its debt. Without growth, Europe will not be able to develop or survive competition from emerging countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This growth requires increased competitiveness, more resources allocated to education and training, as well as increased efforts in research, development and innovation. I call for a new public-private partnership with a view to creating centres of excellence in research and innovation and to creating – why not? – an Erasmus programme for first jobs, following the success of the Erasmus university scheme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to see the European political policy-makers listening more to entrepreneurs and to social partners, since they are the ones who live with the reality of globalisation and who can help us emerge from the crisis. Ladies and gentlement, achieving growth also requires that we pay special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. We must not ride roughshod over them. They are the ones who bring us jobs and who help us to overcome the crisis. Yet they are asked to bear administrative, fiscal and social costs that are too high. If we want them to be able to expand and hire people, this growth will require greater flexibility for investing as well as for keeping and creating jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the single market was the great idea of the 1980s. With the single market, Europe has won growth points and our manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale by gaining access to a continental market instead of a national one. Nonetheless, we all know that the European single market is far from being completed, especially in the services sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am asking the European Commission to get down to the task with as much ambition and determination as it showed 20 years ago. That is where growth is. Ladies and gentlemen, growth cannot be decreed. It is achieved by a whole series of structural measures, the ones precisely that we have already adopted in the Europe 2020 strategy. We now need to roll up our sleeves and above all apply these measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time for Europe to speak strongly and intelligibly, not only to counter populism, which is the enemy of the European people, but to propose long-term solutions that our citizens understand and expect. It is time that our elected national representatives accept that voluntarily shared sovereignty is the only future for our countries, and I mean the only one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am asking you, Mr Barroso, to propose to the European Parliament and to the Council a plan to get us out of the crisis. A plan that can be, for the 500 million Europeans, the chance for a fresh start, the chance to overhaul their project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need bold actions and proposals, understood – I repeat – by our fellow citizens. Europe has always made progress in crises, but we still have to make the right proposals and believe in them. I always say that, before the crisis and after the crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. Things will be different. Mr Barroso, we must propose this change to our fellow citizens so that once again they believe in politics and in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso has given us a realistic description of the situation that the European Union is in. We have been waiting a long time for you, Mr Barroso, the person who stands at the heart of the European Union institution that you represent, finally to take a more aggressive stance and to be prepared to defend the Community method, if necessary, as we have heard today, by fighting for it. I would like to thank you very warmly for this on behalf of my group. It is a good starting point.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We are living in an era when the certainties that we have relied on for decades are disappearing. There was the certainty that European integration would continue to make progress. It became obvious as early as 2005, with the votes against the constitution, that this was no longer the case. There was the certainty that the European project was irreversible. That is also no longer the case. There was the certainty of generations of people that Europe would do its share and that their children would have a better life than they had. My parents were sure that I would have a better life than theirs. That was how things were. Generations of people were certain of this. We younger people knew that we would have a better life than our parents. It was obvious and it was within our grasp. Behind all of this was the idea of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the situation like today? Can we say that our children will have a better life than we have had? Our children are the ones who are asking us: How are you planning to make sure that the prosperity that you have enjoyed all your lives will also be there for us?</p>
      <p sl="de">Countries where more than 50% of young people, some of them highly qualified, are without jobs, are not compatible with the certainty that Europe as it is today is laying the foundations for a return to full employment, for social security and for investment in education which brings results, and parents are investing a great deal in the education of their children. Why is that the case? Is it because the European approach to integration is wrong? I believe we all agree that the idea that Europe, with the institutions created for the purpose, can ensure the continuation of this prosperity by taking joint action from an economic, environmental, social and cultural perspective remains the right one. What is wrong is how the idea is being handled and how it is being managed. There is no crisis in the European idea. There is a crisis in European leadership. This is why the things that you said here today were correct. The intergovernmentalism which is flourishing in the European Union can no longer even be referred to as intergovernmentalism. One of the institutions of the European Union that we never talk about is the Council. The Council itself, the body which represents the governments of the European Union, is being stripped of its powers. You only have to speak to the people who sit on the Council to find this out. Decisions are no longer being made by the Permanent Representatives Committee, by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) or by the General Affairs sessions in the Council. We are sliding back into a situation where the Member States are acting alone and this is bringing Europe to the brink of collapse.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">This is happening even in the light of the challenges which we are facing in the 21st century. We can genuinely compare these methods with those of the Congress of Vienna in the 19th century, when the great powers of Europe, as they have now informed us, want to come together once every six months to debate the issues behind closed doors and then to tell their astonished subjects about the matters that they once again cannot agree on. That, ladies and gentlemen, must not be the future of Europe. This is a patchwork democracy that they want to present us with, where ultimately not even the spirit of the community is responsible for decision making, but rather the political opportunism of the relevant capital city. The political tactics of the party most recently in opposition or in government in a Member State, whether the country is large or small, are ultimately more important than the worldwide stability of the monetary system. That is the crisis in Europe and that is what we must fight against. I believe that we have seen the first signs of that today.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the European Union suffering from? It is suffering from the fact that the policies of the Member States who are acting alone are being driven by the markets. By the way, these are the same markets, as you have rightly said, which had to be stabilised with the help of the national budgets a few years ago. When we talk about the markets, we need to be specific. We are referring to banks which have gambled away billions of euros on the basis of the Anglo-American economic model that is still being sold to us today as the perfect solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Three years after the most serious banking crisis we have ever seen, we are in the situation of standing by and watching helplessly while a young man in his early thirties gambles away EUR 1.5 billion belonging to a Swiss bank. He sat down at his computer, entered a few numbers and, in a flash, EUR 1.5 billion had disappeared. It is only three years since we last experienced orgies of speculation of this kind. This was a Swiss bank which, I assume, has accounts containing capital that has been taken out of Greece for the purposes of tax evasion. I am absolutely sure of this.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">This is why I am asking these Heads of State or Government: when will you finally come up with some concrete proposals for regulating the markets? When will you finally put a stop to this devastating speculation involving financial products that no normal person can understand? When will the countless promises that have been made finally be followed up with action? These are the crucial questions.</p>
      <p sl="de">A dangerous vacuum has formed in Europe because of this behaviour. This vacuum is the result of the governments’ failure to act. You have begun today, which I think is rather late, but I hope not too late, to play your part in filling the vacuum. We in the European Parliament are being called on, together with the Commission, another European institution, to establish the legal foundations for putting in place these market regulations in areas where we can have an influence.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is completely clear that if I, as a head of government, reduce the pensions of people in Germany, Greece, Finland, Slovakia or wherever, and then say that I have to stabilise the banks, and these are the banks with managers who are saying that they knew nothing about this young man’s speculation and who then go home with compensation amounting to millions, despite their complete lack of awareness, then I can understand why the people are going out onto the streets and demonstrating. I can understand why this is happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">The vacuum caused by the failure to act and the failure to regulate the markets is being filled by a dangerous mixture of emotions: hopelessness among young people and despair among their parents, who are now beginning to realise that the project which they believed in is no longer delivering what it used to. The result is huge mistrust in the European Union and in the concept of community values. We need to counteract this mistrust by taking clear and specific action.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is what we have heard today. You are right. The man who can solve this problem is not someone who has been appointed behind closed doors, however nice he may be and even if he is called Herman Van Rompuy. Anyone who wants economic governance in Europe can have it here. It is just over there. Anyone who wants it to be democratically monitored by this Parliament only needs to look at the Treaty of Lisbon. That is where it is described.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we do not need is for the Member States to act alone, alongside the Treaties. What we must have is a European legal framework. This is a community based on the rule of law and not a random number generator. Anyone who wants this crisis to be resolved must strengthen the institutions of the European Union, because the challenges of the 21st century – the environment, the monetary system, migration – cannot be resolved in the individual Member States, but only by the European institutions presenting a bold and united front. That is the task of the European Parliament. I believe that the overwhelming majority of this House is prepared to do this and the few Members who believe that they need to drum it into us using flags or words that the national state is the right solution are the people who are taking an axe to the social, peaceful future of the next generation. Therefore, I am calling on the pro-European groups to act together.</p>

    <intervention id="3-015-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy VERHOFSTADT" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group" nationality="Belgium" birth_date="11-04-1953" birth_place="Dendermonde" m_state="BE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the President of the Commission for his speech on the state of the Union and also for a number of his proposals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us be very blunt about this. As you have recognised, the state of the Union is bad. Let us also repeat here in this House that this crisis is not about Greece and Greece’s debt. This is a crisis about the euro, about the European Union and, in fact, a crisis today about the existence – the vital existence – of the European Union. We are confronted today (shouting from the Chamber) – yes, the only difference is that you gave bad answers to that question, that is the problem – because the real questions we have to ask are: are we able to stand together in this crisis? Are we able to stand united in this crisis? Are we able to show real solidarity in this crisis, and have we the vision to do so, the courage to do so and the political leadership in the European Union to do so? These are the questions that we need to face today.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us start with the state of the Union. The state of the Union is bad, but I think we have to face today’s reality. We are in the middle – not at the end – of a crisis, really in the centre of it. Look at the reality. Mistrust of banks has again risen over recent days and weeks. Markets and stocks are at the lowest level since 2008. The International Monetary Fund yesterday lowered its growth forecast for Europe for next year to only 1.1%, down from 1.6%. Some economists are already talking about recession in the Union. Finally – this is important because we will come back to this later on – spreads: the tensions inside our markets have never been so high. Before the financial crisis, the spreads in the eurozone – that is the difference between the average of the obligations, the bonds of other countries (and Germany) – were only 19 – less than 20 – basic points. Today the spreads are ten times higher. The average of the bonds in the eurozone – NT bonds – is more than 200 basic points, with, naturally, Greece at 2 149 basic points of difference – a 21%-higher interest rate. In Portugal there is a difference of more than 1 000, as there is in Spain. In Italy there is a difference of 400 basic points. These are tensions that are not sustainable. This must be solved not yesterday, not today but in a short time period because it is unsustainable to continue like this.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a second question that we have to answer today. What solutions were provided for this crisis – mainly by the Council, as has been indicated, and mainly by the Member States? They were half measures, measures that have been seen as too little, too late. You will remember that the first Council initiative after the start of the crisis in December 2009 was to announce a European solution to the crisis by launching EUR 30 billion of bilateral loans to solve the crisis. That was the big idea in February 2010 of the Member States and the Council. No European answers, no: bilateral loans to a single country in the south of Europe. That should create the solution. What we saw was the crisis becoming more and more difficult to overcome.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should say that the highlight of this bad approach to the crisis has been the casino deal of the real world. The decision was taken between France and Germany not to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact but to weaken the Commission’s proposal on the Stability and Growth Pact. We were in the middle of the crisis on the Stability and Growth Pact and then the Member States came forward with a proposal, saying that they had a deal in Deauville, near the casino – which is not such a bad one, everybody wins there – and in the end the outcome was that we lowered the sanctions, we lowered the penalties and you could simply continue the game inside the Stability and Growth Pact. This has ruined the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
      <p sl="de">So, Mr Barroso, the most important conclusion of today has to be the message that you gave. You gave it here, very well and to much applause, but now you have to repeat it in another place, somewhere in Brussels, at the Council. I am no longer there, but I am sure we will know what you say there. You will have to repeat it there, telling them that the intergovernmental method is a bad method that cannot work. And why can it not work? Because it needs unanimity; the Polish know about that, as Poland disappeared in the 18th century because of the unanimity rule in the Polish Parliament: that is history and reality. The same could happen in Europe if we continue with this unanimity rule. We have to abolish it. Colleagues, this is the real problem. Why is there such a problem in this crisis? Because the Member States are reluctant to transfer new sovereignty and powers to the European Union. We all know that the only way out of this crisis is a new transfer of powers to the European Union and to the European institutions. That is at stake.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, I am pleased with a number of the initiatives that you have announced today. They are key to my group. You have said that we shall take an initiative in the coming weeks on eurobonds. You have already found a new name: stability bonds. No problem. You can call them what you like – eurobonds, stability bonds – if they are bonds to mutualise debts and, as you have indicated, to make and create more discipline – not only solidarity – in the Union. Very well, we look forward to this in the coming weeks. You have said that we shall put proposals on the table to organise economic governance beyond the six pack. I think this is necessary and is a first step to real economic and fiscal union. You have also said that you should reflect on the external single representation of the eurozone at international level.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, what I am asking is that you go further than this and that in the coming two weeks, at the European Council on 17 October, you put a global plan on the table of the Council. Why do you have to do that? Because otherwise they take their own initiatives in the Council. You have the right of initiative; they do not. If you do not use your right of initiative by putting a document on the table with these different initiatives in it, others will fill the vacuum.</p>
      <p sl="de">This should be done on three specific topics. First of all, the organisation of the real economic government inside the Commission. You have said here that we are the real economic government, but the reality is different. Mr Juncker, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Rehn, Mr Barroso, the President of the European Central Bank, we have at least five people who represent Europe. We need one, and it can only be a senior Commissioner that you have to appoint. Make him European Minister of Finance and then all this discussion of who is representing the euro would be over.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I missed one important element in your proposals. There is a European plan to recapitalise the European banks. The problem of the European banks has not been solved, and we shall not recover from this recession or the stagnation or economic downturn if we do not first of all recreate trust between the banks and recapitalise them. Only a European solution can solve this. I know that Mrs Merkel refused that proposal on 4 October 2008. She heard on the radio that there were some problems with a German bank. So you see what history can signify: if she had heard that news maybe three hours before, she would have accepted the solution of a European rescue plan for banks.</p>
      <p sl="de">But let us come back to this. Mr Barroso, my request to you is that you put all this in a document on the table of the Council in two weeks’ time. We cannot do it as a European Parliament. The European Council cannot do it. You have the power, you have the right of initiative, and I can tell you that this whole Parliament will be behind you if you take such an action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, how are you, President Barroso, how do you feel? I must admit I feel a lot of sympathy for you because I genuinely believe that you are aware that the situation is serious. At the same time, I have to admit that I do not share many of your views. I agree with you that fiscal consolidation, curbing of public expenditure and financial rigour are necessary because markets are very sensitive and markets at the moment do not forgive any mistake. However, good intentions are not enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us make one thing clear: the euro currency was imposed on states of different development, different purchasing power, different GDP per capita, different living standards, different budgeting and different levels of competitiveness. It was done purely for political and ideological reasons because the euro should have served as a tool for further integration, not primarily as a single currency per se.</p>
      <a text="(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit)"/>
      <p sl="en">Then came public overspending, lack of discipline, and this directed some countries to the verge of collapse. In normal situations at such a time countries would devalue their currencies to cope with those consequences but, of course, as members of the eurozone, they cannot do that because they are not allowed to do so. So the only solution remaining are firstly bail-outs, more bail-outs and even more bail-outs, or whatever you want to call them, and secondly, transition of monetary union into a fiscal union and, thus, most importantly the debt union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The logic of the first step, the bail-out step, is that the debts of some will be paid by the others, and the second step will mean a further shift of national power to the European level and further diminishing of the role of Member States. Mr Verhofstadt might like it, I very much doubt that most members of his own group like it as much as he does but, again, the most important thing is whether the people of Europe like it and whether it will help to promote more pro-European thinking amongst European nations. If you think that it does, you are wrong, ladies and gentlemen. I can tell you in my own country a recent poll has shown that 75% of people are against joining the euro, and do you really think that this is a result of some anti-European propaganda? No, it is not a result of anti-European propaganda, it is just a result of people who see and think. They simply do not buy into this idea any more of a federal Europe – that is very simple.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask you frankly, President Barroso, do you concede that it may come to a situation where, as the only solution to the current problems, it might be that one or more of the eurozone members would have to leave the monetary union? Secondly, would you admit that some other still non-eurozone members could re-evaluate their thoughts about joining the eurozone or not? Please do not get me wrong. If it comes to that, my feeling is that it will not mean the fall of the euro, because none of us wishes that, but the mentality of the euro at all costs is precisely the way to destroy the euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that, if it comes to a reduction of the eurozone, that might be a political disaster for those who invested a great deal of their political capital into that idea, into the idea of a United States of Europe, but that is their problem. President Barroso, I can agree with you when you stressed the necessity to reinforce competitiveness, to complete the single market, to improve the legal background. Believe me, you achieve none of these things with an old and outdated EU framework. Mr Schuman, Mr Monnet, they were undoubtedly nice guys but their ideas are 50 years old. So please let us stop thinking in these terms because now, President Barroso, unfortunately for you, you have almost no choice between bad decisions and even worse decisions. For instance, another ‘worse decision’ you came with, which you have just mentioned, is the financial transaction tax. It sounds fine at first glance, just a small fee for transactions, but in the real world such a tax will lead to only one conclusion: that countries and institutions will seriously reconsider their location and they will leave the European market and this will undermine further the European economy. It is very simple. We need a new EU paradigm for the 21st century. Unfortunately, there is very little chance, almost no chance, of this new paradigm being born in this very building, in this very assembly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that almost everyone here in this Chamber was pleased to hear what you have explained to us, Mr Barroso, about how you are now prepared to take a major leap forward for Europe. You will have noticed this from the applause you received. Before we come to an understanding about the next stages of this leap forward, I would like to say something about the analysis of the situation as we see it. Mr Verhofstadt has said that Europe is in a bad state. As far as the financial and economic crisis is concerned, I would say that until now we have managed to prevent the worst case scenario from occurring, but we are a long way from having everything under control. If we take a look at the Member States, it is clear that what we have been saying all along, namely that we have done too little too late, is still the case today. Some Member States are now voting on the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). I am not saying that this is the wrong thing to do, but if we put it in the context of time and space, a decision should already have been made about the permanent crisis mechanism, its structure and the genuine establishment of economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this ‘too little’ and ‘too late’ applies not only to the actions of the Council. When I look at the economic governance package which we will be deciding on, I have to say that we have taken our time over that as well. There were good reasons for doing so. Nevertheless, we are now missing out on some opportunities with regard to this package. It is not a leap forward in terms of positive growth. We have talked so many times about the imbalance between stabilisation policy and the policy for development and for finding ways out of the crisis and this has still not been resolved in this package.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I believe is the real subject of the political crisis in the European Union will not be resolved by our proposals on the financial crisis, nor by our proposals in the context of the ‘six pack’. Our real problem is that over the last few years we have created more injustice in various areas using a number of different measures. If we do not resolve this, we will not be able to control and bring an end to the centrifugal forces which exist not only because of the tendency of Member States to act alone, but also because the citizens of Europe are losing confidence in the ability of the Union to function.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of injustice, I believe, Mr Barroso, that we cannot go on in this way. For years the players on the financial markets have been earning huge amounts, until it came to the crunch. Then the decision was made to nationalise the problems and leave the profits with those people who had happily been engaging in speculation. I believe that this is a big problem and that the citizens have understood that until now the stabilisation process has taken place at their expense. I believe that, because of the increasing necessity of taking action to resolve the debt crisis, we are once again doing things that will lead to even greater injustice. We cannot rely solely on austerity measures. When we look at what is happening in Greece and in Ireland, the increase in the suicide rates in these countries alone is enough to make us blush with shame. We cannot unilaterally restructure budgets and introduce savings. We must at the same time do what my group has always been committed to during the negotiations on the economic governance package. We must consider how we can combat poverty in the European Union. We must resolve the issue of how we can invest in education. We must also make genuine investments in sustainable economic development, otherwise we will find that most of citizens are no longer prepared to support more Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I would like to emphasise once again, Mr Barroso, three months before a delegation from this Parliament travels to Durban for the next world climate conference, that even though you mentioned renewable energies and investment in sustainable development in your speech, it is really disturbing how quickly things are forgotten in European policy. In 2007 and 2008 we agreed that it would be more expensive not to invest in ambitious plans to combat climate change than we had realised up to that point. We will not be able to bring about intergenerational justice with our existing austerity measures, unless we have a clear plan that defines how we will organise sustainable development, with a focus on preventing climate change and ensuring the efficient use of resources. What you have to say on this subject is unfortunately very weak.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I wanted to say something about the Southern Mediterranean region, but I will not do so now. I would like to wish Baroness Ashton every success in turning our past, the history of Europe in the Southern Mediterranean, into a topic for discussion. I also wish her luck in the negotiations on Israel and the Palestinian state, because the two-state solution and peace in the region are further key factors in improving development in the Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Mr Barroso, I would like to say something on the major leap forward that you have announced. You know that we want you to be the person who ensures that something which we have constantly been referring to as economic governance is actually tackled. I believe that in the next few weeks your ears will sometimes be burning, if you consistently implement the things that you have promised here. If you discuss this with the German Government or the Dutch Government, you will think about Mr Verhofstadt and ask yourself why he has not strengthened the resolve of his Liberal colleagues in government.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Verhofstadt, we love your European wit, but we sometimes miss it when we have to deal with your colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to discuss one more point and turn to the other side of this House. Mr Barroso, the Polish Presidency could be very important for the approach that you are taking. With its attitude to Europe and to the tendency of the Member States to go it alone, the Polish Presidency could bring about a genuine move towards preparing for another amendment to the Treaty and could lay the foundations for what we understand as economic governance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Harms, are you aware that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands has proposed a Commissioner – Mr Rehn, to be specific about it – as a sort of European finance minister? We believe that this is a good idea.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second question to you is as follows. You have spoken here about imbalances and about the investments that need to be made. How do you explain the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be voting here today against a better, tougher, stronger Stability and Growth Pact, which will stabilise the eurozone, while we in Berlin are being given wonderful advice by the Socialists and the Greens?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am fully aware that the Dutch Government takes a different position from the German Government in some areas. However, there is one thing that we really must not forget, which is that the governments, including those with Liberal members, do not share and are not promoting the unconditional commitment to less intergovernmentalism and more Europe, as presented by Mr Verhofstadt.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns our criticism of the three reports which are being adopted here today and which cover stability policy and the process of dealing with budget deficits. We are fully convinced that we need a sustainable budgetary policy. Our focus in budgetary policy is also on intergenerational justice.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we are not in favour of the way in which budgetary policy is being implemented and you can take Greece as an example of this. If there is no possibility of creating a future for young people at the same time and if there is no possibility of saying how sustainable development, which is constantly being discussed, should be started, we do not believe that this contributes to intergenerational justice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, the European Union is undergoing its most serious crisis since it was first founded. This is something that we definitely all agree on. It is, of course, all about the economic, financial and debt crisis, about Greece and about the euro. The Member States and the European Union have not put in place sufficiently effective regulation of the financial markets. As a result, the policy is likely to end up at the mercy of the speculators.</p>
      <p sl="de">The measures which have been taken so far are aimed at budgetary consolidation by means of cutting spending. In concrete terms this primarily means reducing social security budgets. It means cuts in salaries and benefits, rising unemployment, falling public investment and a drop in real economic growth. More and more decisions are being taken on an intergovernmental basis without prior agreement with parliaments, but instead in agreement with bank bosses. As a result, the European Union is increasingly losing confidence and support. The eurosceptics are gaining ground and that is a fact. The European Union is in the midst of a crisis of political credibility. I believe that we are all of the same opinion in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, we do not entirely agree either on the analysis of the causes of the crisis or on the best ways of resolving it. Despite the need for criticism, I would like to emphasise that we on the left are aware of our responsibility for the European Union. The idea of European unity is a left-wing idea which has been defended by many left-wingers past and present. We will continue to defend this idea in the future and we will make sure that it is not surrendered to the profit interests of the markets and the speculators.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that Europe needs much more cooperation, rather than a further withdrawal into national interest. Europe needs a jointly coordinated, democratically legitimate, economic, fiscal and social policy based on solidarity. Therefore, we will support you, Mr Barroso, when you finally present the promised legislative proposals, which have been called for by Parliament, as the first steps towards comprehensive regulation of the financial markets, taxation of financial market transactions and Eurobonds in order to reaffirm the principle of solidarity in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will continue to emphasise the value of solidarity between states and between people and the urgent need for it. Solidarity does not just involve financial aid. It also involves resisting the governments’ mania for austerity measures. As the main representative of a genuine European institution, you should be able to support our call for a step back from this culture of austerity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that the social divide within society is growing much wider also seems ominous to me. The politicians are focusing on saving the banks and making available credit facilities of hundreds of billions of euros. However, the ordinary people are being left to pick up the tab for the failed policy of deregulation and privatisation. Huge austerity programmes are being imposed on them, they have to work longer hours and their wages and benefits are being cut. They are at the mercy of the governments’ austerity programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Social justice is simply being trampled underfoot and we cannot go on like this. The mass demonstrations in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain are making this quite clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say that either we will take a joint route out of the crisis based on solidarity, which will allow the EU to emerge from the crisis in a better, more social, more sustainable and even more democratic form, or there will be no solution for the EU as a whole, with damaging after-effects that are hard to predict.</p>

      <p sl="de">This is why I am also defending the Community method. That is what I wanted to explain. Otherwise we need, of course, to differentiate clearly between all these things.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Barroso told us this morning that the European Union is an inspiration. Mr Barroso, whilst you admitted to there being one or two little economic problems, you made it perfectly clear that jobs and growth were to follow, that everything is going well. In fact you painted a vision that a new period of European renewal is upon us.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a former Communist yourself you probably remember the old Soviet leaders getting up to give their speeches and telling everybody that there was a record harvest or that tractor production figures were terribly good, and they of course believed that history was on their side. In fact President Khrushchev got up and said to the West: we will bury you. So much did he believe in his own Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now of course we look back at that and we laugh. I think that in our tomorrows people will look back at you and they will say: how on earth did this unelected man get all of this power and how did Europe’s political class sitting in this room decide that the Community method should replace national democracy? I think people will look back in astonishment that we have surrendered democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">But what you want to do is to say, right, we have a European Union and what we have to do now is have more of it. So, as an architect – and you are one of the key architects of the current failure – you say that even though everything to date has been wrong we are going to do more of the same.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thought that was a definition of madness. I cannot believe that this is a rational response to any situation in which you find yourself and, far from it being a State of the Union, I would argue that the Union is in a state because just look at the confusion. We have got you as President of the European Commission, we have a President of the European Parliament; we have got my old friend Herman van Rompuy who is the permanent President of the European Council; we have got the Poles, they are now presidents temporarily of the European Council; we have got presidents all round this room. Goodness me, even I am a President. I am not sure what the collective noun for presidents is, perhaps an incompetence. I do not know.</p>
      <p sl="en">But certainly when you take away democratic accountability it is clear that nobody really is in charge and it is developing as a Union of intolerance. Anybody who stands up here and dares to give a political view which is different from the received wisdom is written off as mad, insane, violent and fascist; we have heard it for years from these people. The intolerance is so deep that, when we get referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland that reject your view, you as a political class see it as a problem to be overcome. So I am very worried about the whole root of this Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a new nationalism that is sweeping Europe. You want to abolish the nation states, in your case, Mr Schulz, perhaps because you are ashamed of your past. And you now want this flag and a new anthem to replace nation states and you do not care how you get there. If you have to crush national democracy, if you have to oppose popular referendums, you just sweep this aside and say that it is populism.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it is not, it is democracy. What is sweeping northern Europe now, starting off in April with that amazing result in the Finnish general election, is a new democratic revolution. It is not anti-European. It wants a Europe of trade; it wants a Europe of cooperation; it wants a Europe where we can do student exchanges and we can work in each others’ capital cities; it wants those things. But it does not want this European Union model. Frankly, you are all now yesterday’s men.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this point is often made, namely that a country like Britain is only 62 million people and are we not better off being part of a big European club so that we can have more of a voice on the world stage? Funny that, is it not? Here is Britain, the world’s fifth largest trading nation, which is now prohibited from going into World Trade Organisation talks because all of that is done, on our behalf, by an unelected European Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Duff, the answer actually is that an independent Britain that trades and cooperates with her European neighbours in an age of globalisation would be able to forge her own trade relationships across the world. It would make sense for a country like ours to start off with the English-speaking world, which shares common law – our own kith and kin in the Commonwealth who we turned our backs on so shamefully.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us face it, the European Union is bankrupt already. This is slowly dragging the Netherlands into a sinking morass. The EEC was adamant that countries like Greece should adopt the euro despite the enormous risks which it was aware of beforehand. As a result of that decision, we are now dealing with a crisis of unparalleled proportions. Meanwhile, the Dutch citizens are being asked to foot the bill.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Europhiles, who have created these problems, now even want to go a step further. President Barroso, for example, is now openly advocating the introduction of Eurobonds. That is an absurd idea, Mr Barroso. The euro crisis was caused by the southern euro area countries being allowed to borrow money too easily. The last thing we need now are Eurobonds because they will make it even easier for Member States to run into debt. That is the recipe for another crisis.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Who do you think you are actually representing, Mr Barroso? Surely, you realise that Member States such as the Netherlands fiercely oppose these Eurobonds. Why are you not supporting the countries which are still keeping the European Union going? Mr President, the situation is clear as far as we are concerned: Mr Barroso has sided with the euro sinners. In the meantime, Member States, such as the Netherlands, whose household budgets are in order, are being squeezed out like a lemon in order to foot the bill for fraudulent Greece, for example. Mr Barroso, as far as my party, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), is concerned, you might as well clear your desk and go and look for another job. The President of the Commission ought to protect the interests of all Member States. The PVV is of the opinion that you are not capable of that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, President Barroso, Commissioner, honourable Members, first of all let me thank you, Mr President, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Council in this crucial debate. I would like to thank President Barroso for his remarks, and I especially want to emphasise what he said about the need to restore growth in the European Union. This has been reflected in a number of interventions today. The growth agenda is also at the very heart of the Polish Presidency programme, where we are working very closely with the Commission ahead of the October European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here let me mention two elements: first of all, the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. It is the EU institutions and the Member States working together in the framework of EU 2020 which will ensure that we emerge stronger from the crisis. Second, the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, which we started this autumn. There are, of course, very different opinions on the MFF to be reconciled. Everybody refers to the economic climate that underpins those discussions. In any case we will have to find compromises, and for the Council Presidency there are two elements which are absolutely crucial in those discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we must have a comprehensive, profound debate on the basis of the proposal from the Commission. Secondly we must find consensus on the idea that the money should be spent on supporting Europe in its search for stable and balanced growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me use this opportunity briefly to say that we are looking forward to the very important vote today in Parliament: a very important vote for economic and monetary union and a very important vote for the European Union. This vote on the ‘six pack’ is a milestone on our way out of the debt crisis and towards more fiscal and economic transparency and discipline. This will also mean more power for the Commission, and I am happy that we have found support for these proposals in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to acknowledge in this process the role that Parliament has played in making sure that the package is coherent and ambitious and the fact that you have shown flexibility and responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another example, from the last 48 hours: correlation tables, where we actually enhance the role of the Commission as the guardian of the Treaties. This is also a way of showing that we are transparent in the implementation of European legislation and that the Union works.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, another example from the last twelve hours: a compromise in the trialogue on the external financial instruments. The reason why I mention those three – the six pack, correlation tables and the external financial instruments – is very simple. The message is: the Community method works. The sceptics can be proved wrong, and I address this to Mr Zahradil in particular, because I think people from your party in the Czech Republic and Poland do not read the facts, they just live in a dream that the European Union will crumble. I think you will be proved wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">To close, I just want to say that, concerning economic and monetary union, Schengen, foreign and security policy, the single market, energy and all the issues that President Barroso raised today, you can count on an approach by the Presidency which will include more Europe, not less Europe; more support for the Community method rather than intergovernmentalism; and finally, support for ever-closer union and not for ever-looser union. That is the only way to rebuild trust.</p>

      <p sl="it">The economic crisis is also an institutional crisis, and it is right, as you said, that we should relaunch the European project and seek new solutions to the crisis that we are experiencing. Fear is actually the driving force of a populist and nationalist vision, and it is courage that is, by contrast, the value that created Europe and has given it peace and prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mind, though, Mr Barroso, although our ideas and your proposals are the antithesis of populism, our voters are often that way inclined. This means that if the reforms that you outlined are not implemented in the course of the next few months, they will paradoxically become the pretext for Eurosceptic criticism. You began this round with three aces, Mr Barroso. Now play the ace of hearts of the ‘Lionheart’, submit your proposals to Parliament and the Council, and together we shall win this hand.</p>

We need tangible action, and young people need hope.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The crisis of trust is just as serious as the economic and financial crisis. Our citizens will never support our actions unless they trust us. Our measures are always accompanied by tardiness and indecision. We are even losing a generation of young people that still believes in Europe.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Barroso that Europe needed this speech. You have rarely been as much in tune with your audience. One more diagnosis? Yes, but coupled with undeniable determination. This is a pleasant contrast to the rather withdrawn role that the Commission has played over recent years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, allow me to be somewhat doubtful, to my great regret I must add. Those of our Member States that have, for years, been going all out against the EU are not here today to tell us if they agree with the broad lines of your speech.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One speaker has just said that Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet’s ideas are more than 150 years old. Allow me to point out that, in an attempt to oppose Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman’s ideas, Mr Zahradil, who we are talking about here, has just used ideas more than 150 years old.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have made it quite clear today, Mr Barroso, that you are not an honest broker, you are the head of the European government. Your Commission is responsible for economic governance. This is why we are opposed to any duplicate structures. We should now be making an effort to end this cacophony and to turn the President of the Commission into the Chair of the Heads of State or Government of the 17 and Mr Rehn into the Chair of the eurozone, until the Treaty is amended.</p>
      <p sl="de">Present us with a road map for creating an economic and social union. Make it clear that you need a budget which enables the Commission to act. Thank you for the own resources.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Dr Barroso, I should naturally like to congratulate you on the additional hope that you have given to all us Members of the European Parliament and, in particular, to the citizens of the European Union whom we represent here. Having said that, I should also like to say that we are now expecting very, very determined action from the Commission alongside the Council, so that this sovereign debt crisis might be resolved in short order.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that it is a marathon, but immediate signals are necessary. Therefore, leaving aside the fact that we are all thinking already about amending the Treaties that are the political expression of the entire project that we have brought this far, leaving that aside, something needs to be done now. This package of measures and, perhaps, an agreement; an agreement between all the Member States, along the lines of what we have been calling a ‘shareholders’ agreement’ that goes beyond the Treaties and could put all these ideas into practice, starting now.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Many congratulations on your courage and your determination. I believe we are on the right track and will leave here today with new determination.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Mr Daul said, quite rightly in my opinion, that after this crisis nothing is likely to be the same. The debt crisis will probably alter Europe’s status if no solutions to it are found in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Let me give you an example. Until now, Europe has been putting pressure on China to implement human rights and the rule of law. Now it would appear that China is starting to put pressure on Europe to acknowledge, for example, its market economy status. In the future, that might lead China to put pressure on Europe to accept mediocre environmental norms and a low level of consumer protection. That is why it is absolutely important for Europe’s future status in the world to be free of this debt crisis. For that reason, all the efforts that you, Mr Barroso, have proposed are very important and deserve our respect.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, President of the Commission, thank you for your speech. I have to say that it is actually the first time in two years that I believe what you are saying. I think that you made a good speech today. Having said that, however, I would also like to say that we are experiencing a very serious crisis, both in political and in economic terms. We therefore need to put words into action. You need to show us results, and you need to show us concrete proposals. I would like to make a few comments in this regard, because we need something that goes far beyond what we have on the table right now. We need a comprehensive, coordinated crisis plan for Europe, which will ensure stability, sustainability and social justice.</p>
      <p sl="da">In this connection, we need three things: 1) a resolute assurance to the markets that we are standing shoulder to shoulder with regard to the euro – there must be no more hitches, and you must take the lead here; 2) we cannot use cuts and savings to bring us more growth and employment – we need an investment plan and a jobs plan; 3) the focus needs to be placed on revenue again in Europe. Thank you for your proposal for a financial tax – we have waited a long time for it. Mr Barroso, we must convert what you have said today into concrete action. We need to stop believing that cuts and pretence can save Europe. We must have an overarching, comprehensive crisis strategy, and that is the most important job for you to do over the next few months.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, you have made a very good speech, Mr Barroso. What is important now is putting it into practice, in other words, the follow-up, as Mr Verhofstadt has said, and ensuring that something really happens here. I believe that we agree almost unanimously that we need more Europe in order to be able to overcome this crisis. However, we need the right Europe and for us that means that we want a stability union rather than a debt union. We need to include a ‘debt brake’ in the national constitutions. We still need, and here my opinion differs from that of the Chair of my group, different interest rates, because they act as an economic ‘debt brake’. We also need an organised process for national bankruptcy. We need rules which determine what happens when a country becomes unable to pay its debts, so that we can keep it in the eurozone. That is the crucial point. We need a stability pact with teeth and with automatic sanctions. I would like to say one thing. The plan by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to vote against this tougher stability pact here today is a continuation of Gerhard Schröder’s policy of 2003, which aimed to destroy the stability culture of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this debate on the state of the Union comes at a critical time; as others have already said, it is the worst in the Union’s history.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, although the state of the Union is not good, I join those who have expressed their conviction that the unrest that can be felt throughout Europe is not a result of what Europe does, and much less what Europe says – which is often applauded in this Chamber – but rather the lack of Europe, what Europe does not do, and the contradiction between what it says and applauds, and what it actually does.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our governments talk about making difficult decisions. They impose those decisions on the citizens, but they do not impose them on themselves. Are they willing to give up their short-sightedness and short-termism, their strictly local and national interests, in favour of necessary solutions? Are they ready to do what has to be done, rather than doing too little too late, in a fragmented way and in the wrong direction?</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, I might add that it is not true that in order to do what must be done, it is necessary to reform the Treaties. Absolutely not. I agree with those who believe wholeheartedly that there was a time when we did not have instruments, but we did have determination and will. Now we have the instruments, but we are lacking the will and leadership.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We heard – at last, I would say – these strong words that are necessary if we want to address the political decision crisis that we are in, for beyond the economic, financial and social crisis that you described, and the confidence crisis, there was and is a political decision crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By asserting today loud and clear the Commission’s role and its constructive proposals – of which some have already been implemented, on financial regulation in particular – and thanks to this Parliament, thanks to what will be voted for later on I hope, and thanks to the joint work that we will once again undertake – like Mr Schulz said earlier on – I think that we can make Europe move forward in the right direction and give you all the support you need, and that, henceforth, you fully deserve.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Dr Barroso, honestly, a year ago you announced Eurobonds here. You repeated yourself today and I suspect that in a year’s time you will repeat yourself again. We could even end up with you introducing yourself to us saying ‘the name’s Bond, Eurobond’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We all want Eurobonds, Dr Barroso, but the truth, and the problem, is that the secret agent that we currently have, who has secret plans and a licence to kill, is Chancellor Merkel. Today we have found out about the Eureka plan.

      <p sl="pt">However, changing subject, I should like to ask you if you have spoken about Palestine, Dr Barroso. We already know that the European Union does not have a common position on Palestine. What I cannot grasp, but would like to understand, is how it is that Europe has a word to say about these peace process negotiations, when the proposed budgetary support for the Palestinian Authority in 2012 represents half the sum implemented in 2010 and a cut of one third in relation to 2011. I should like you to comment on this please.</p>

      <p sl="en">That sense of déjà vu was heightened for me when I heard one Member actually say that, after your speech, you should be called ‘Barroso the Lionheart’. What nonsense. The political class in this House, led by you and the Presidents in this House, should hang their heads in shame. We have a monetary union that has been politically inspired.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Barroso has said today that the European Commission is the de facto economic government of the Union, and we can infer that it is going to seek formalisation of this state of affairs. Using the crisis as justification, the Union wants not only to recover, but also to move forward, strengthening integration and creating the foundations of a European superstate. However, all the talk about the economic crisis is ignoring the crisis of democracy and the crisis of values. Further possibilities have been announced today concerning amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon, which was adopted against the will of the citizens expressed in referendums held in several EU Member States. Indeed, the process of constructing a European state is being carried on without any reference to the most important values upon which Europe is built, by which I mean Christian values. What is more, we are witnessing an attempt to disown them. It needs to be stated clearly and emphatically that no reform will be successful without a return to the true roots of Europe.</p>

Why – you who have been seven years at the head of the Commission and two years in the driving seat of the European boat during the crisis – have you waited until today?

Europe is as much hostage to extortion by financial and banking circles as it is to the indecisiveness and dilly-dallying of the European political elites. Where was the European Commission in August, Mr Barroso? Where was the European Parliament? We can criticise the Heads of State or Government, but at least they broke their holidays. Europe cannot be governed with such an attitude. It is unfortunate that the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) postponed the final vote on the legislative ‘six pack.’ What would have been appropriate in June is no longer enough, it is now insufficient and more is needed. A policy of austerity is not enough, yet all the European right-wing, including the Hungarian right-wing can come up with is austerity.

Europe, both in the eyes of European citizens and on the international scene, seems to be weaker and more vulnerable in the face of the crisis. The economic debate is marked by indecisiveness, doublespeak and an inability to take bold decisions which, when they are taken, albeit belatedly, are called into question the very next day. On the issue of the area of security and freedom, we have seen unilateral acts which directly call the Schengen Agreement into question.

Today, the result is that our European Union is weakened. So, is a shake-up possible? You said that it is. Well, I wish you were right.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are several conditions for this: firstly, we need to press all the political players and all the European institutions to come together. Secondly, we need to reaffirm loud and clear the principles that have made Europe, namely solidarity and the community spirit. Thirdly, we need to say that a single country leaving the euro area is not a possibility. You said so and that is good. Fourthly, we need to put on the table a coherent comprehensive package. Mr Verhofstadt talked about this in detail, so I will not go over it again.

      <p sl="pt">It needs a third thing. It needs the political legitimacy to use this debt and to make this economic recovery plan. That is a thing that the President of the Commission can guarantee, by taking steps to ensure that the next President of the Commission is the man or woman chosen by the 500 million citizens in the 2014 elections.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The purpose of this would be that, in the end, when there are good ideas on the table, they cannot be killed off by the leaders of Paris or Berlin at a summit next door to a casino, and that the voice of the 500 million would make itself heard so that we could have a European Union with genuine solidarity; not the type of solidarity that we have now, which, I must confess, scares me a little more each time I hear it mentioned.</p>

      <p sl="de">Young people understand above all that with 9 billion of us living on the planet by the middle part of the century, we will be fighting for energy, raw materials and food. Therefore, let us establish a European pact for environmental stability which includes energy efficiency, the efficient use of resources and sustainability. We have started to do this and it must not be allowed to get lost or be given a lower priority during the crisis. These problems will not go away. They will remain and they may even become more pronounced. Please encourage the whole of the Commission to make progress with the environmental profile of the EU. We will have the young people of Europe behind us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have spoken today of a renaissance and I am joining Mr Leinen in referring to this. Renaissance means rebirth. If we are to give birth to something again, we should be aware of what sort of environment the new project is being born into. We only have complete agreement about the European project in one area and that is the European peace project. The policymaking which is currently going on will put this project and this trust at risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today we have frequently heard the criticism that the flame of Europe is obviously only really burning in this Chamber and that a great deal of child abandonment is taking place, when we look at the Council and the individual Member States. This means that it will be our joint task – the Members of Parliament, your task as President and, most importantly, the task of the Council Presidency – to help to ensure that this renaissance takes place in an environment where we have the trust of the people. We will not have this trust if we take the European Union not only in the direction of being an economic and monetary union, but also in the direction of a social union. I believe that this is also missing in the ‘six pack’. It provides no guarantee that the economy will be sustainable or that there will be opportunities for the future. We will only have a future in Europe, if the people come with us into the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">The crisis calls for immediate choices and timescales that we should probably not have chosen in normal circumstances. I cannot nor do I wish to imagine the scenario that would unfold if Europe and the euro were to fail. Therefore the choices turn on three issues: on reforms to the way that things work, a plan to emerge from the crisis and attention to timing. I shall refer solely to the plan for a solution to the crisis, which is growth, and which must be achieved. Here we have a great game, which you mentioned in connection with project bonds, relating to this Marshall plan, which we can now call a modern ‘Barroso plan’, concerning the EUR 1.6 trillion that are going into the construction of this great infrastructure plan.</p>
      <p sl="it">To make those of us who believe like me and like so many in this House once more proud of this Europe: that is the goal we must achieve right away. Pay heed to the urgency, President Barroso.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, President of the Commission, today was an important day, and Mr Barroso’s speech was an important one. I think you have achieved a good result, because you have established the three Cs: courage, credibility and confidence.</p>
      <p sl="es">It has been said here that the Community method is antiquated. However, the Community method has brought us many years of peace and prosperity. The Commission plays a vital role in that method; indeed, it lies at the very heart of it.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore very significant that today, at this time of crisis and confusion when our people are asking for guidance, the President of the European Commission has made such a committed speech.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating you on your strong speech, Dr Barroso, and on the message of determination that you have brought before us, for which you received deserved applause.</p>
      <p sl="pt">You spoke of a Europe of citizens. Now the citizens are asking, how we have managed to reach this crisis, and so many sacrifices, when Europe has 7% of the world’s population and 22% of its gross domestic product.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the big question is this: what is our escape route? You know, Dr Barroso, that the citizens are sick of words: what they want is action. One of the actions that should already have been taken is putting a stop to tax havens. During the French presidential elections, President Sarkozy talked about putting a stop to tax havens, but nothing has been done as yet.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In addition, we also need to move ahead with fiscal harmonisation, because no single currency can survive without fiscal harmonisation. I believe it is important to stress this, and that austerity and responsibility should be in harmony with solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to talk to you more specifically about the public service sector, to tell you that it is vital for the European Union’s economy. May I remind you that it represents 26% of GDP and a third of all jobs in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is the Commission doing in this regard? On Michel Barnier’s initiative, it published last April the Single Market Act – you mentioned it – which is aimed at boosting growth within the internal market. I welcome this initiative. For his part, Commissioner Almunia published only a few days ago a reform on state aid rules that apply to economic services of general interest. His ambition to simplify and clarify is supported by our Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Beyond these two initiatives, Mr Barroso, I believe the Commission should be much more ambitious still. At the start of this parliamentary term, you committed yourself to proposing a communication on this matter to Parliament before the end of 2011. However, there is no sign of that yet.</p>

In addition to everything you have listed, I should like to add a further point – we must take care that our actions agree with our words.

To get out of this crisis we have to help and support Europe’s people first. It is of utmost importance to invest in education to boost the job market and to reduce the unemployment rate in Europe, especially among young people. Concerning the EU’s finances, we have to first ask the respective agents to take their responsibility. One thing has to be clearly understood, namely that Member States’ overspending must end since the consequences are taken out on our taxpayers.

The Member States have to bring their economies into balance and cut debt.</p>

The EU cannot afford new crises now: this has to be dealt with in a controlled manner, in compliance with the Treaties. I do not support Eurobonds either.

      <p sl="fr">Then, listen to us on the social issue too because, you must admit, this morning you were a little brief. What did you say about an initiative in the area of company restructurings? We are waiting for strong proposals in many areas where, evidently, you are struggling to convince the Member States. The fact is, that is your mission and your role.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this morning’s session reminded me very much of the congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in its dynamics, especially as there is one man speaking from the podium and about 90% of those who watch him in front of their television sets understand that what the man says has nothing whatsoever to do with reality and with their experiences, yet their representatives applaud enthusiastically. Why? Because there is a huge gap between the representatives and those whom they are supposed to represent. That is something that should immediately be changed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another similarity is that those who want fundamentally to protest and change the system have to face police brutality, as we had to in Hungary between 2006 and 2010. For example, the trade union leader Judit Szima has now been under house arrest for several months, and György Budaházy and Endre Szász, who are opposition leaders who tried to fundamentally alter the system, have been in prison for three years now.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, concerns over the stability of the euro and the state of the Union in general are unfortunately here to stay. Although the Commission, the Council and the ECB took considerable steps to calm the international markets, we have yet to see a satisfactory solution to the financial crisis and Greece’s bankruptcy. I agree with you that it could give reason for hope that the EU already took a historic leap once in the past fifty years, similar to the one required to solve the current situation. We are now in a similar historic situation, as today we will be voting about the legislative ‘six pack’ that redefines the foundations of economic governance and also contains the key to our common economic success; however, all of this is has no meaning if the single currency is not sufficiently stable. The founding fathers, too, would probably be rather taken aback if more than fifty years after the founding of the Community they had to thank the BRICS countries, of all, for leading the euro area out of the crisis.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank you for your clear statement on the Community method, Mr Barroso. We should remember that when the Stability and Growth Pact was breached and when the Schengen Agreement was breached by countries such as Denmark, one thing became clear: it is the Member States which are breaking the rules via the Council. If we want to restore credibility in the markets, we must follow the rules. The potential offenders are not able to do this. This is why we must strengthen the institutions of the European Union. I believe that we need to make that clear to the public and not the other way around. I would like to thank you for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that the Councils of Ministers are handing over more and more responsibility to the European Council when the situation gets difficult. Now there is a proposal to introduce a European Council of the 17. We have been fighting for 25 years in the European Union for majority voting in the Council of Ministers and now we are reintroducing the unanimity rule via the European Council.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, European integration was born as a means of overcoming divisions and providing a framework for achieving economic prosperity and sustaining – even reinforcing – Europe’s role in the world. We have, since then, created impressive political and institutional structures and are dealing with many different policies in the framework of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, our achievements are now being challenged as we face major internal and external challenges. The euro crisis represents our greatest test so far. No matter how hard all of us have worked for democratic governance, the legitimacy of the European construction is being questioned.

Unfortunately, the measures implemented by some European Union governments have proven to be ineffective. This is why now more than ever we need complete mobilisation to revive the European Union’s economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this respect, I think that the European Union needs to take action as an entity and acquire the skills for coordinating fiscal policies at EU level and, if applicable, implement common economic governance, but with a well-funded budget.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, let me start by thanking this House for the strong support given to my statement on behalf of the European Commission. I think it is very important for all of us in the European Commission to feel that support coming from the most important political forces in Europe and for you, who have been directly elected by our European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course I was not expecting unanimity. One Member of Parliament, a British nationalist, attacked me on the fact that I am not elected. I want to tell you that since the age of 29 I have always been elected by my own Parliament. I was Prime Minister of my country, I was leader of the opposition of my country and I am here, as President of the Commission, because this Parliament voted for me to be President of the European Commission.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">If you do not respect the institution to which you belong yourself, this is not my problem. Regarding Britain, I would like to make this point to you. As far as I know, you have tried several times to be elected to your own British Parliament. How wise the British people are that they have never elected you to your own Parliament and sent you here.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">If you want your country to leave the European Union, say it in London and try to get your country to agree. But do not say it here because, as far as we know, your institutions and your country want to remain in the European Union. If your country does not want to be in the European Union, do not speak on behalf of the others, do not speak on behalf of Poland, that just today set their commitment to the Community approach and to a stronger and ever-closer European Union. If Britain believes that it can, because of its past empire, or because of its dimension, defend its interests in the world alone, try to get that point across in your country. But I think the majority here believes, as was said, that to protect our interests, to defend our values in the world of globalisation, to speak with one voice with our American friends or China and Russia, we need a stronger European Union. This stronger European Union is also a way to reinforce our countries, the countries that we all represent around this House.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">This point is very important. This is a point of substance, apart from the other funnier parts. How we build a European Union is a point of substance. Are we going to build a European Union against each other or with each other? That is why I welcome this message of support, not only from the most important political forces here and the consensus expressed, but also from the current Presidency of the Council, Poland. We need a Community that matters: a Community spirit and a Community approach to reinforce our common interests. We need to build a European Union with our Member States, but we also need to build a European Union based on the rassemblement of all the major pro-Europeans, the most important political forces of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with Andrew Duff that we also probably need to reform some of our European political parties, so that we can also have a collective expression in the European public space of this European democracy. Today some of you said ‘yes, but’. Please, among pro-Europeans, do not say the ‘but’, just say ‘yes’. You do not say to your loved ones – your wife or your girlfriend, your husband or your boyfriend – ‘I love you, but’, you say ‘I love you, I support you’. We need your support to make Europe stronger because Europe’s real problem is, as I said, also a problem of confidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be completely clear. The problems we have in Europe today did not arise because of the European institutions. The problems we have in Europe today arise because of narrow national interests that have prevented the European project from moving forward. So I say to those of you that criticise me, or the Commission, that we are ready to accept all your criticisms, but the Commission is proud of the work it has achieved. Today we have not only made a speech, but we have put forward a programme with proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Everything I said last year in the European Sate of the Union I checked; we have delivered. Every proposal I made today to you, we will deliver and we need your support and not your doubts and your scepticism. That is very important today because we need to build this stronger support for a stronger Europe in a spirit of confidence. Today you are going to vote on the ‘six pack’; some of you do not agree but the proposals were made by the European Commission one year ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have tabled 29 proposals for the Financial Regulation. Some of the points you have made are already on the table for the Council. About capital of banks we have put forward a capital requirements directive. Some of you do not agree but it is there, our proposal. About tax evasion we have asked the Council, and so far we have not yet received a mandate to negotiate with third countries the issues of taxation because what is happening so far is that countries are negotiating alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have put forward the tax savings directive. Regarding the services publiques , the public services, I have committed to present it before the end of the year and we will do it. We are going to respect all our commitments and today I also put forward before you the financial transaction tax. So there is no lack of proposals. The question today is to get the support, not only of Parliament but also of our Member States. So when we speak about Europe we have to be clear about what we mean by Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because this is one of the problems in terms of the scepticism in Europe. Some people say Europe does not deliver. Let us put it frankly: is it Europe that does not deliver or some governments that do not deliver? This is the real question in terms of the European Union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">As I said, one of the problems is political and political confidence and we need to make the case for Europe. Today when some governments say: ‘we do not have enough support for the euro; we do not have some support for the European Union’, probably they are right. But we have to ask them: did you make the case for Europe? Did you make the case for the euro? Did you explain to your citizens what we have to lose if we do not keep our strong commitment to our common achievements? So we need to make the case for Europe. And this is a collective task from the European Commission, of course, from Parliament – and you have been elected and you can of course discuss this matter and I know you are doing it with your electors but also from our governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to make the case for a stronger Europe, that is why I have highlighted the importance of the political leadership, the political responsibility, and I believe that we can unite ourselves in terms of the points I have made.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reality is, honourable Members, we have different sensibilities around Europe. We have those who like to highlight stability; others prefer to speak about growth. Those who prefer to insist on responsibility and discipline, others want to insist on solidarity and cohesion. We need all these ideas. We need to put together this vision of a common Europe and the points I have made today to you – and once again I want to thank you for all your support – are not only the points of a speech: they are the points of a commitment programme, and so let us work together to make it happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us work together to make Europe stronger, let us work together in a true community spirit with the respect for Community matters to deliver for our citizens a stronger, united and open Europe. I believe this is what we need in Europe and what the world needs from us.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The crisis we are experiencing requires swift and courageous responses. As the situation in Greece demonstrates, there is a need for an alternative agenda to extreme austerity, and for protection of the weakest and the unemployed, who have nothing to do with the cause of this crisis. As such, in addition to the necessary budgetary consolidation, Europe needs to ensure its ability to invest for growth, to create services and to maintain essential public services. The economic governance package should include a growth pact, in order that the Member States might make productive investments, capable of reversing the current economic situation. Moreover, Europe is not demonstrating long- and medium-term vision, and is exhausting itself with an austere reaction to the present crisis. Budgetary targets should exist in parallel with the Europe 2020 strategy targets. Decision-making processes should be made more democratic and robust, without nationalism, so that Europe can respond faster and more effectively. Europe also needs a system of Eurobonds to help stabilise the markets, a financial transactions tax to obtain new income and limit types of speculation, a stronger European budget equipped with own resources, and an end to tax havens.</p>

      <p sl="lt">We cannot argue with your statement, President of the Commission, that the European Union must be reformed. The continuing and deepening crisis demonstrates very clearly that the existing model of EU governance is unable to react to complex situations and mobilise the political will to adopt decisions that may be radical but which are unavoidable. The only way for us to remain a Union of solidarity and unity is to review in principle the entire EU governance model. The Commission must become the body that draws up common guidelines on economic governance and has all the powers to monitor the economies of the Member States. Without a clear economic governance structure, the economic governance and coordination measures proposed will not lead to greater economic integration and the coordination of Member State economies or the monitoring of financial markets.</p>

      <p sl="nl">With this package of radical measures (the ‘six pack’), we are laying the groundwork for a strong European economic policy and creating a defence against potential financial crises in the future. We are laying the foundations for a healthy and strong single currency. These are the measures that will enable us and Europe to emerge stronger from the crisis. It is essential that the European Commission is put in the driving seat here, because that will enable it to ensure that governments respect these measures without fail and that Member States which go off the road are taken to task. On the basis of these clear rules, we now need to take further steps in order to kick the European economy into a higher gear. Eurobonds and project bonds, which President Barroso has announced here today, could play a vital role in this respect. Introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) is another important step forward. Europe is taking the lead with this and creating a very important instrument (EUR 55 billion of revenue per year) in order to bolster the economy and promote jobs. At the same time, the introduction of a FTT would send out a strong political signal to European citizens. With the FTT, Europe will be making it clear that financial institutions must themselves make a substantial contribution in times of severe financial and economic turmoil.</p>

      <p sl="en">The State of the Union address failed to acknowledge the disastrous year had by the EU and suggests forging ahead with deeper integration to prevent threats to key legislation such as the Schengen acquis and single currency. There are reasons why these have come under attack. They are unworkable and opposed by many within the EU. To adhere to them demonstrates how dismissive of public opinion and devoid of reason the Commission is. Regulating the financial market to resolve the outcomes of poor judgment by the Commission over the eurozone is thieving from the success of the City of London to feed the failures of the single currency. The naïve utopian view of the Commission is little more than a foolhardy path to failure. Such is the case with common migration policy. How can the Commission control and balance migration without impeding the liberty and mobility they claim are central tenets of the European vision? Expansion is laughable when the EU struggles to effectively operate in the extant Member States. Inking new FTAs undermines national variance and independence. Member States are being lead into a quagmire of interdependence where sovereignty will be an unattainable memory.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The speech made in the European Parliament today by the President of the European Commission was just another number for the markets to see. At the same time, it was an attempt to silence the critics who had been accusing the Commission and its President of inaction and of systematic submission to the German directorate of Chancellor Merkel. In the end, the applause that united the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is enlightening and symbolic of a ‘unity’ that has driven the EU and its Member States to the current crisis, which is still there, as can be seen from the adoption of the economic governance package, welcomed by Dr Barroso. That package represents the reinforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact and the restrictions inherent to it, which particularly affect the weaker economies and are largely responsible for Portugal’s weak economic growth over the last decade. As for the rest, strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility represents nothing more than transferring yet more public debt held by banks to the public sector; that is, onto the backs of the workers and the people. The financial transaction tax has been announced for the umpteenth time; doubts remain about its practical effects. For the time being, the most speculative products – such as derivatives – have been saved, with derisory taxes, whilst tax havens remain untouchable. Combating speculation has, therefore, had scant practical results.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the face of the most serious crisis of recent decades, to which the neoliberal policies of the European Union have contributed, the Commission is insisting on deepening capitalist and neoliberal integration, adorned with a few fig leaves of demagoguery that have not even tweaked the fundamentals of the powerful financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is not enough to say that a financial transaction tax is being created, at a ridiculous rate, if tax havens continue to flourish and the derivatives markets continue to feed speculation on the sovereign debt of the countries with the most fragile economies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Even the measure of increasing the rate of co-financing for countries with so-called financial assistance programmes, which we have been demanding for years, is too late and, unfortunately, does not even mean the Union budget is being increased.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By insisting on the same neoliberal and so-called austerity policies, on reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact, and on the centralisation of economic and political power, what we will have is the deepening of economic asymmetries and social inequalities, and of unemployment and poverty, with no future prospects for the almost 23% of young people who are jobless or the more than 100 million people at risk of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why we support the struggle of the workers and the people for the break and change that is needed, as we will have in Portugal next Saturday with the demonstrations by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP).</p>

      <p sl="sk">In recent times we have been subjected to a deluge of catastrophic reports about the situation in the Eurozone, the EU and European integration as a whole. That the situation is critical I agree. On the other hand, a bit of historical perspective would not be out of place. The EU is still a successful project, which during its short time in existence has succeeded in uniting European nations and become a leading world force. Even if individual steps taken in its history can be criticised, I personally see the EU project so far as a huge success for multilateralism and international cooperation. At the same time I should like to add that I have my doubts on some of the scenarios that are presented here on a daily basis regarding the situation in the eurozone. I am particularly ashamed by the fact that at this very moment it is the Slovak government that is putting the brakes on measures to prevent the crisis from breaking out in its imminent next stage. That is why I would like to appeal to absolutely everyone involved in today’s debate to put aside their party colours and national interests, stop their short-term political point-scoring, and treat the EU as a single entity in the context of its history. The EU is still in good working order, even if the outlook is unclear. It all depends on our resolve, and I believe firmly that when the state of the Union is evaluated in the near future, we will not have to find that it has deteriorated or completely disintegrated. Let us avoid making a historical mistake.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I was honoured to listen to your report, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Commission for the work performed under your leadership. You are doing a difficult job in challenging times. At the same time, however, I have to admit that your report, in addition to the positive feelings, filled me with considerable unease. Regarding the future of the Union, you spoke of the need for further integration. Your next proposition, however, that not all countries of the Union would be able to proceed towards greater cooperation at the same speed, is astonishing and even unacceptable to me. My understanding of it is that the Commission is committed to the model of a two-speed Europe, and that it wishes to continue dividing Europeans into first and second class citizens. In my opinion, bodies such as the European Parliament or the Commission should unify, not divide, Europe. I do not want to be a second class citizen and I do not want anyone else to be one either. I would therefore like to call urgently on the Commission to focus on drawing up the model for a future, unified – not fragmented – Europe. Only a Europe such as this can succeed in global competition, with competitive labour, manufacturing and currency.</p>

      <p sl="hu">When we talk about economic policy in Europe today, we almost exclusively refer to financial policy. We do so despite the fact that the financial sector is but a very small segment of economic policy. We, both as EU decision-makers and as national legislators, should be discussing economic policy in its entirety, and should take our decisions after weighing every one of the means it offers. Economic policy is indeed about more than just financial steps. It should provide guidance to industry, make way for innovation and R&amp;D, and encourage investment. It should take care of the three I’s: innovation, industry and investment. If we do not decide as soon as possible about the direction the economic role of the European Union should take, it will be exceedingly difficult in these crisis-hardened times to guarantee common, effective and successful action. We carry a responsibility for the generations to come and it is we who must now ensure a secure future for them. For that, we will need innovation, a once again solid European industrial policy, and incentives for investment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There is probably no one who doubts that the European Union currently finds itself in a profound crisis. What is more, this crisis concerns not only the economic situation, which is where its impact has been most noticeable, but it is also a crisis of politics, of society and of identity. We are currently focussing on rescuing the single currency and trying to hammer out a support plan for Greece and other Member States in danger of bankruptcy. However, we should first of all be asking ourselves the question as to what the Union should be like – a Union which will very soon number 28 Member States. While concentrating on economic reforms, we must not forget that our Union is of a much broader nature and that we are not just a community based on economic and monetary union. I think the budgetary crisis in some countries of the euro area has obscured other threats from our view. Have we noticed the rising wave of xenophobia in our societies? Have we registered that our economy is increasingly being penetrated by China, and that Beijing is setting individual Member States against each other? Do we have a strategy in relation to what is happening at the moment in North Africa? Have we noticed that the United States is now ceasing to be a dependable and stable ally? Do we have answers to these questions today – do we have a strategy which we can follow?</p>

      <p sl="pl">We must remember, however, that just tightening our belts will not be enough. The next decisions we are going to have to make will be decisions about ways in which we can achieve a growth in competitiveness for our European economy. In my opinion, we should begin implementation of the measures contained in the Euro Plus Pact as quickly as possible, which means carrying out responsible pension reforms, undertaking reforms relating to wage indexation, reducing the burden of work associated with VAT collection and building a truly single market. Other questions to be resolved are matters concerning the method of funding research, education, innovation and infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the debate on the state of the Union, the three most important questions are as follows:1. Fundamental rights – in its annual report on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Agency for Fundamental Rights called for action to be taken in particular on the treatment of asylum seekers, social exclusion of the Roma and personal data protection. If the Union wants to continue to boast of being known as the guardian of fundamental rights, it must urgently face up to these problems. Furthermore, two of the EU’s Member States, namely Poland, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council, and the United Kingdom, have not adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights in full.</p>
      <p sl="pl">2. Women – women and men have equal rights only in theory. In practice, women suffer discrimination politically, economically and socially. They earn on average 17% less than men, they hold lower positions and it is more difficult for them to be promoted and combine a professional career with bringing up children. Half of Europe’s women have experienced violence, and between one and two million suffer it daily. Women are underrepresented in legislative and executive authorities at all levels, on the boards of banks, economic organisations and large firms and in science and scientific research.</p>
      <p sl="pl">3. Poverty – almost 84 million Europeans are at risk of poverty. The fight against poverty and social exclusion must be a priority. During the economic crisis, poverty has risen significantly among children. In relation to this, I call on the Council and the Commission to draw up and implement a strategy aimed at reducing poverty among children by half by the end of 2012.</p>

We hear much talk about the need to address the democratic deficit in the EU. But you spoke to a parliamentary chamber that appeared to be less than half full. Your speech should have inspired, and shown the way to salvation, but MEPs could not even be bothered to turn up and listen. So do not be surprised if the people of Europe fail to report to the polling booths in large numbers, or if the level of citizen engagement is low. We hear much talk of the Commission's environmental concerns and priorities, and yet we, our staff, and the press corps had to come all the way to Strasbourg, as we do 12 times a year, to hear a speech that you could have made in Brussels.

I agree with the statements about the need for all pro-Europeans to join forces to defend the European project and act to meet challenges through closer European integration. Here, the role of Parliament and its work alongside the Commission are particularly important. It is crucial to strengthen the EU, specifically through its institutions supporting the Commission to defend Europe’s common interests and support European integration. I would congratulate Dr Barroso on his determination and courage, and I am counting on his College of Commissioners to table concrete proposals that will have a genuine impact by 2020. The Multiannual Financial Framework will play a crucial role, focusing on the areas where the EU can make a difference.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I can confirm to you that the Commission statement is accurately reproduced in Amendment 11, but as it is a very important statement I would like to read this for you to make sure: ‘Before the end of 2011, the Commission intends to present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the setting up of a system of common issuance of European sovereign bonds (eurosecurities) under joint and several liability, in line with Article 8a(5) of the regulation on the enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area’. These euro securities would aim to strengthen fiscal discipline and increase stability in the euro area through markets as well as by taking advantage of the increase in liquidity, ensuring that Member States enjoying the highest credit standards would not suffer from higher interest rates. The report will, if appropriate, be accompanied by legislative proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of its first report to Parliament and the Council on the application of this regulation as foreseen in Article 8a, the Commission intends to review the functioning of any successor mechanism to the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stabilisation Facility during the period covered by the report. This review will assess the contribution of this mechanism to the preservation of the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, to the reinforcement of budgetary discipline among Member States and to the improvement of economic governance and coordination at EU level. It will also assess the effectiveness of the institutional arrangements which govern the aforementioned mechanism and evaluate the possible benefits in terms of the effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of different institutional arrangements.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to make the following statement on behalf of the Commission. The Commission welcomes the adoption of the regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances. The regulation recognises that the nature, importance and urgency of the policy challenges may differ significantly depending on the Member State concerned and that, given vulnerabilities and the magnitude of the assessment required, the need for policy action is particularly pressing in Member States showing persistently large current account deficits and competitiveness losses. It also recognises that in Member States that accumulate large current account surpluses, policies should aim to identify and implement the measures that help strengthen their domestic demand and growth potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">In implementing the regulation, the Commission is fully committed to respecting this approach and will ensure that macroeconomic surveillance covers countries with current account deficits and surpluses with appropriate differentiation as regards the urgency of policy responses and the type of corrective actions required.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for the economic governance reform package as we are facing a tough time and this set of measures marks a very important step in the process of consolidating macroeconomic supervision and financial discipline.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We must take on much more ambitious and tangible commitments to enable us to achieve objectives in the future, such as boosting competitiveness, promoting employment, consolidating financial stability or improving the state of public finances. The experience acquired during the first decade of the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union has highlighted the urgent need for better economic governance, entailing both a real commitment at national level and a much sounder framework for monitoring national economic policies at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Defining a set of minimum requirements for national frameworks means that we will encourage both the assumption of budgetary responsibility and an efficient deficit procedure. Last but not least, Member States’ budget planning must be based on realistic forecasts, while focusing suitable attention on the sustainability of their social protection systems.</p>

      <p sl="it">I believe that in a seriously critical moment like this, the most important thing that Europe can do is to react with urgency to a demand that comes from its citizens. I therefore believe that this package does not go far enough, but it is absolutely necessary to continue down this road, strengthening the instruments of growth but bringing budgets under control and increasing regulation in order to enable development to be managed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Consequently, I think tomorrow is an important day for focusing on what has made the European Union the most important democratic institution at this time. Certainly, much remains to be done, but this is an important initial response, and we could not miss the opportunity, after years of discussion in which we failed to tackle the greatest crisis in our lifetime with the necessary urgency and firmness.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the headline in one German newspaper today read: ‘Stability tiger now has teeth, EU Commission is given more power to control the euro’. For this reason, I have been able to vote in favour of all the reports with a clear conscience, because that is exactly what has happened, with regard to compliance with the deficits and the transgressions. The fact that we now have a semi-automatic sanction mechanism and that from 2012 we will be able to monitor imbalances on a macroeconomic basis are important steps in the right direction. It is also possible to put it in another way, which is that the European Parliament has now done its homework, together with the Commission, on stabilising the eurozone and the European Union. What is now missing is the active involvement of the Member States. I would like to ask the Member States to join in this concerted campaign and to take decisions which move in the same direction.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the experience of these last years and the current extremely difficult situation that some countries in the eurozone are experiencing have demonstrated the need for improved economic governance in the Union, which should be built on a more robust surveillance framework at the Union level of national economic policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is in order to establish macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances, allowing for durable output and employment growth. I therefore consider it to be vital that we approve this package of six legislative acts, which will allow us to avoid a future reoccurrence of the conditions that have seriously compromised the stability of our economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">We are doing this in order to take responsibility and bring budgets under control, even where national governments, the governments of Member States, have failed to do so. This is, moreover, the moment at which the credibility of our institutions, of European institutions, is at stake. Europe is taking upon itself the duty of making its citizens’ demands its own and of securing that stability, that government in order to create the conditions for growth, without which there would not have been and could not now be a future for our citizens and especially for new generations.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is precisely here that there is a need for intervention. We are waiting for all Member States to put in place concrete measures that have been requested for an extraordinary plan to reinvigorate competition and real jobs, while keeping an eye on the poor, on marginalisation and on social inclusion.

      <p sl="it">We all want various countries’ books to be in order. We all want to reduce debt. Nevertheless, it is clear that without a sensible policy of investment capable of breathing life into the economy, there will be no possibility of growth. The one clear outcome of this approach is that the greatest price will, as usual, be paid by the least well-off. That is why we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have voted against this report. In fact, it continues down a one-way street that is one of austerity without growth, a direction that has so far proved to be the wrong one.</p>

That trader happily told us that Goldman Sachs rules the world. Not governments, he says. It is Goldman Sachs; it is the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well one of the reasons I voted for today’s report is to say, no, it is not the markets that determine our future. It is a civilised, rules-based approach to economic governance. I refuse, I refuse on my own behalf and on behalf of Irish and European citizens, to cede power to the markets and to bow to the madness that is fuelled by profit. I do not have all the answers and yes, we are part of an unstable and badly constructed currency, but I will do all I can to ensure that past mistakes do not influence future outcomes.</p>

The reason why the financial markets have lost confidence in our Member States is that they do not believe that our Member States will be able to repay the money that they already owe. Today’s legislative package, that is, the legislative package on financial surveillance that we have jointly developed and adopted, is a very important step towards weathering this storm, towards restoring the financial markets’ confidence in our national economies and our governments, which ultimately means the well-being of our people. However, ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to remember that this legislation will solve and prevent the problems of the future.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am firmly convinced that we must now draw the necessary conclusions for a strategy which will ultimately make Europe as a whole stronger after the crisis than it was before the crisis began. The decisive question will be whether the instruments adopted in the context of the ‘six pack’, in particular with regard to Ms Wortmann-Kool’s and Mr Feio’s reports, can really guarantee controls of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="de">The compromise which we have now reached on the preventative part of the Stability and Growth Pact involves two steps. On the one hand, the Council will vote with a qualified majority on a recommendation by the Commission for corrective measures to be taken in a Member State’s budget. If this recommendation is not accepted or is not even processed, the Commission can resubmit it within a month. The proposal will be deemed to have been accepted if the Council has not rejected it within 10 days with a reversed simple majority vote.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against the background of this regulation, I am of the opinion that this is a step in the right direction. However, we must wait and see whether the Member States really submit to these rigid requirements or whether they attempt to circumvent the rules, as they did in 2003. We in Parliament must make every effort to ensure that the Community method really takes precedence and that we can ultimately implement these rules effectively.</p>

The compromise we make today represents a commitment to our common values and goals. I voted in favour of preserving the integrity of the EU. It is through this that the EU guarantees its own competitiveness and that of its Member States, as well as its internal convergence, a strong monetary union and a sustainable social market economy, and prevents the emergence of future crises. This ensures the present and future welfare of our citizens and societies. I am thankful that we stood side by side in this compromise.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, since the financial crisis hit, the EU has responded with more spending and more debt. It has emptied the treasuries, it has exhausted its credit, it has turned the ECB into a bad bank and now where does it go for funds? Well, the financial transaction tax.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us leave aside for a second the idea that we can impose such a tax in isolation in Europe; let us leave aside the bankers having to pass on the cost to their customers. Ask ourselves and say where do most financial transactions in the EU take place? They take place in the city of London. In other words, yet again Britain is being sent the bill in order to prop up a currency which we declined to join. This has been the unhappy story of our association with the EU these past four decades. It is just like the common fisheries policy. We are expected to put more into the common pot from which others will be drawing and those are the two bookends. This has a somewhat manic fin-de-siècle feel about it, these unconstrained ambitions of so many European leaders expecting the peoples to pay, again and again. ‘There be many Caesars, ere such another Julius’ wrote Shakespeare in Cymbeline , ‘Britain is a world by itself and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses’.</p>

That excessive approach has led us in part, at least, to problems we find ourselves in at the minute. Thankfully, we are beginning to address it and get on top of the situation and, as my colleague Marian Harkin said, politicians are supposed to be in control, not the markets or agencies.

Let us recall that on 16 June, the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, came here and dwelt at great length on the need to refer to ‘Euroland’ rather than to the eurozone. In June, the problems seemed to be more ones of lexicology and terminology rather than of substance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then recall that President Barroso, whose determination and the resolute way in which he delivered his speech I greatly admired today, assured us in 2008 that there was no rational motive to fear a recession. Today, we are living through a time in which a new pride in Europe and of being pro-European brings with it a great taking on of responsibility, including in the measures approved by this Parliament.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I supported the report by Sylvie Goulard. As with other reports encompassing the six pack this morning, it does not purport to solve our current problems. Part of that roadmap was articulated by President Barroso this morning. I think, for the first time, we had some hope injected into the debate and some reality, but of course now what we need is action and we are still waiting for it.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as this report is concerned, I was happy to see that Article 9 of TFEU is included, under which the Union will take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection and the fight against social exclusion. These are fine words of course, but we have a responsibility in this Parliament to do all we can to translate them into reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was also very pleased to see flexibility in this report, where it states that a possibility will be provided by the Council to reduce or cancel the sanctions imposed on a Member State on the basis of a Commission proposal following a reasoned request by the Member State concerned. That kind of flexibility will be very important for Member States and, in this context, I would like to specifically mention my own country, Ireland.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the debate this morning, President Barroso declared that he was going to raise the number of people of working age in employment from 67% to 75% by 2020. Who knew it was that easy? Why not just declare that we are going to raise it to 90% or 100%. This has been the story of the euro all along: this belief that communiqués from politicians trump any other reality; that wonderful moment just before the summer when there was a summit and the crisis was declared to be over, but the markets did not get the message and then President Van Rompuy wrote a very huffy article in the Guardian in London saying he was astonished by the behaviour of these markets: how could they be widening the bond spreads in Spain and Italy when they had obviously not been listening to what the EU leaders had said?</p>
      <p sl="en">That has been the story of the euro all along, and people are entitled to make their own mistakes. Britain is not a member of the single currency – we should be looking on helpfully, but we should not be dragged into it. The problem with these six-pack votes that we have just voted through is that they do not distinguish between the eurozone and the EU as a whole. We are, as Winston Churchill said, ‘interested and associated but not absorbed’. We have our own dream and our own task, and ‘should European statesmen address us in the words that were used of old: “Shall I speak for thee to the King or the Captain of the Host”, we should reply with the Shunamite woman, “Nay sir, for we dwell among our own people”’.</p>

      <p sl="fi">As we heard from Mr Barroso, and in earlier positions stated by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, these measures in themselves will still not be enough.

      <p sl="it">Ultimately I believe that Europe cannot solve the economic and financial crisis with austerity plans alone. The books need to be balanced, but it takes more than all that.

      <p sl="it">The Commission’s proposals for improved economic governance are crucially important for our economic growth and, in particular, for that of the countries in the euro area. The improvements made by the European Parliament with a view to the creation of a robust and coherent legislative framework are clear. I support the general approach of this report, and accordingly voted in favour of it. We have new responsibilities to shoulder; the package of measures must be further improved and enhanced.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that we should focus more on preventing unsustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies, but above all that Parliament should be given a prominent role in the surveillance process, with regular, systematic debates and public hearings held in Parliament itself.</p>

      <p sl="it">For that reason I believe that the package that has been adopted today will serve as a basis for the growth that the Member States as a whole must in fact aim for. If we stop here, we will definitely not have achieved the objectives that we are setting ourselves, but in taking this step we will certainly be able to achieve that other objective.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the six-pack plan that has just been passed by Parliament represents the institutionalisation of an austerity shock doctrine at the heart of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the surveillance programme, the Commission has now effectively been appointed as a policeman for austerity right across Europe. Fines of hundreds of millions of euros face countries that break with neo-liberal orthodoxy or are deemed to have acted imprudently. In reality they will be placed into a category of miscreant states.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is all about making working class people pay, through austerity policies, for an economic crisis that they are not responsible for. We do not need to look very far to see what the result of those austerity policies will be. The policies have already failed.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I supported the report by Carl Haglund which tells us that experience gained and mistakes made over the last decade show the need for improved economic governance. That governance needs to be based on commonly agreed rules and policies and, indeed, stronger surveillance. But of course that is not all it needs: whether it be eurobonds or stability bonds or a transfer union or the ECB becoming the lender of last resort, other mechanisms are certainly needed to support the euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot say that what we have here today will solve our problems but it is part of an overall solution. Today I have mixed feelings. As we vote on these reports, on one level I feel irrelevant, in the sense that we are not actually working to find solutions to the current crisis and that is what concerns citizens. However, citizens also expect systems to work and we are trying to fix a broken system. It is not headline-grabbing stuff but it matters.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the so-called ‘six pack’ imposes economic rule on the Member States via the European Union. The English Parliament established in the reign of King Edward I that its key reason for existing was control of the public finances. In 1642 the English fought a Civil War and then cut off a King’s head precisely in order to establish its sole right to levy taxes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, not by means of an Act of Parliament, but by means of a regulation from the European Union, the British Government is expected to meekly accept financial control by the European Union. If it does, there can no longer be any pretence that Britain is a sovereign nation or a democracy. The British Government should reject and repudiate these regulations and defend the rights of Parliament. To do otherwise is abject surrender.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have voted in favour of Ms Ferreira’s report, in the same way as I have voted for the entire package. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms Ferreira, the rapporteur, very warmly for her cooperation over the whole of the last year and to congratulate her on the result of the vote.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that the Ferreira report and the accompanying macroeconomic supervision represent a real innovation. In the area of the Stability and Growth Pact, all that we have done is to tighten up the regulations which were already in place. We have not introduced any new criteria and when one part of this House says that we are nipping growth in the bud, then conversely I have to ask: Was there growth in the countries which did not comply with the Stability and Growth Pact? Did the countries which were least compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact have the highest growth? I believe that the analysis of the results in the Member States in recent days shows that exactly the opposite is the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the contents of Ms Ferreira’s report represent a genuine innovation. It should help us in future to identify at an early stage if something is going wrong in a country, which I believe is fundamental. If we had identified the problems early, we would have been spared the situation in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and perhaps also Italy. We would have realised perhaps years ago that something in these countries was not going in the way we thought it should.</p>
      <p sl="de">All I would like to see now is this instrument being implemented effectively by the Commission. I would like it to achieve its objective, which is to function for the benefit of the Union and of the people who live there.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important for the Stability and Growth Pact and the complete economic governance framework to support and be compatible with EU strategies for growth and jobs, with the aim of increasing competitiveness and social stability.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need to introduce penalties for punishing fraud, pay the fines into a central fund for the permanent crisis mechanism and regulate the financial markets more. Ultimately I believe that the austerity measures being discussed today are in danger of weakening social justice policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is not the case with the Ferreira report, which I endorsed and which includes some valuable points in relation to social balance. It is the rest of the package that is wrong, because it focuses solely and exclusively on rigour and austerity and fails to promote growth. Europe will have a future only if we are able to marry fiscal discipline with the objectives of development, growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the global crisis has caused instability among small and micro enterprises, which make up a large part of Europe’s business fabric, and has made it impossible for them to survive.</p>
      <p sl="it">The measures adopted today with the approval of the ‘six pack’ will help to prevent macroeconomic imbalances, but support must be given to small and micro enterprises straight away. To achieve this, we and our colleagues from various political groups have tabled a motion for a resolution calling for Europe to enact a measure to bring in a three-year tax-free allowance for micro enterprises of up to EUR 30 000 of their annual profits, and a bonus equal to the value of social security contributions if they recruit a young person on an open-ended contract.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this way we will be able to prevent many companies that guarantee jobs and development from leaving the market, and we will reduce unemployment, which has reached excessive levels, at the expense of social stability. We would also remind the Council of the need to start the trialogue with Parliament on the regulation on origin marking.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation that we have adopted on the prevention of macroeconomic imbalances among the 27 countries is certainly a departure from the previous situation. It establishes rules and checks and, in particular, it introduces the concept of symmetry, which means that the Commission must assess not only deficits, but also surpluses.</p>
      <p sl="it">In practice, contrary to the commonly held view that there a few bad countries, such as Greece or Italy, countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are also being placed under supervision due to their overly low levels of domestic consumption. Furthermore, the regulation has an essentially federalist outlook and hence stresses the notion of fairness, which we believe is one of the positive elements that characterise the future of Europe and of the Member States – fairness and solidarity, which will be the preconditions for European growth.</p>

We did so because it includes, among other things, a clause on the protection of social rights, starting with collective bargaining, and because it also strengthens Parliament’s role in the adoption of delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, although we cannot change the overall balance of the six-pack, with this report we are definitely making progress towards, among other things, a surveillance system that takes account of fundamental rights.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, on 29 September 2010 the Commission put forward a legislative package to strengthen economic governance in the EU and the euro area. The package comprises six proposals, four of which address budgetary issues, such as the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, while the other two new regulations deal with the identification and management of macroeconomic imbalances within the EU and the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The latter two proposals introduce new elements. The preventive aspect of these elements includes a regular assessment of the risk of imbalances based on a scoreboard of indicators, as well as in-depth country analyses. The corrective branch foresees proceedings against any euro area Member States that fail to comply properly with recommendations that concern them and accumulate excessive deficit, which can ultimately result in sanctions to be imposed in the form of annual penalty payments. The system for correcting imbalances must contain not only sanctions but incentives as well. Fines collected from defaulting Member States should be used to further the EU’s long-term investment and labour goals. I, too, gladly voted in favour of the report.</p>

They certainly go further than what is being accepted by the Council and I think finally begin to address the elephant in the room. It is crucial that we do this, otherwise we are just seen as irrelevant and we are just not dealing with the reality of the situation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we also voted in favour of the Goulard report, because it introduces mechanisms for preventing macroeconomic imbalances that ultimately consist of rules and guarantees, of those rules and guarantees that have been lacking until now and that have been said to be lacking so many times during this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have begun a new phase of budgetary responsibility, control, and also surveillance within the euro area, with mechanisms that are indeed semi-automatic – and this is one of the main criticisms that have been made – but also with penalties that will ultimately be imposed should any macroeconomic imbalances occur.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is a decisive step that, if I might make the analogy, will be supplemented by those subsequent steps that President Barroso has today, by a happy but important coincidence, sought to announce: the introduction of the Tobin tax – the financial transactions tax – will ensure that families are not the only ones who have to pay for these times of crisis and difficulty, and that producers of material goods are not always the only ones who have to pay for crisis prevention, but that financial market operators pay for it, too.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out, now that we have reached the conclusion a year after the proposal was first tabled, that the Feio report reviews the Stability and Growth Pact and hence finally establishes a check requiring States with a debt/GDP ratio of more than 60% to achieve a 5% reduction. It does so by laying down and clarifying the debt criterion and the procedures on the pace that has to be followed.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission will have to consider a range of factors in this global economic context before assessing and making its recommendations to the Member State concerned.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one of the purposes of this Parliament from the point of view of the establishment in Europe is to act as a democratic facade on what is in reality a European Union dominated by big business interests and dominated institutionally by the Commission and the Council. But I think that facade may be beginning to crumble today when you look at what Parliament has passed.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has passed a series of measures, the six pack, that is purely neo-liberal and austerity-driven in content. It has opted to give more power to the Commission to act as an austerity policeman and it has used the notion of reverse qualified majority voting to mean that a simple majority in the Council will not be enough to vote against sanctions applied by the Commission to a miscreant Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">The limited democracy that exists within the European Union is now being trampled upon in the race to impose austerity. What is the European Union establishment afraid of? They are afraid of the working class, they are afraid of the movements of ordinary people, they are afraid of the general strike in Greece, the protests in Portugal on Saturday, the moves within Spain – and I think they are correct to be afraid.

      <p sl="en">I also support the statement that we need a more integrated and social approach. Several times here today I have said that we are not putting forward solutions to the current crisis, but indeed one possibility that is contained in this report that could improve the situation is the achieving and maintaining of a dynamic internal market. I know this could generate significant growth across the EU and particularly in my own country, Ireland, where this has a significant impact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speaking of Ireland, I was pleased to see the statement that the medium-term growth and primary balanced targets of the catching-up countries will be taken into consideration. It also states that measures proposed to a given Member State for correcting imbalances should take into account the Union strategy for growth and jobs. This is certainly an instrument for achieving internal cohesion and also supporting recommendations to respect the Charter of Fundamental Rights and collective bargaining between social partners in Member States.

      <p sl="it">This directive must therefore be applied to the letter, and the Commission must constantly monitor its application.

      <p sl="it">The Ford report, which we have voted on and approved today, by contrast lays down criteria on the transparency and independence of national statistical authorities, with penalties for those who commit forgery and fraud. It is a fundamental report, in that it aims to prevent a lack of transparency in the compilation of statistical data and ensures that those data are uniform.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I supported this report and I certainly re-echo its sentiments when it says that a comprehensive and integrated solution to the euro area debt crisis is needed, because the piecemeal efforts that we have put in place so far have certainly not worked.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think what we did today was to put in place one piece of the jigsaw. President Barroso proposed other pieces, among them the financial transaction tax and the beefing-up of the Europe Investment Bank so that it can offer greater assistance to SMEs. He also proposed, as did Commissioner Rehn, solidarity bonds or eurobonds.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this motion for a resolution refers to the statement made by Vice-President Ashton to mark the International Day against Homophobia.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, perhaps for all the reasons mentioned just now by Ms Mazzoni. Sexual orientation and gender identity is still a cause of serious human rights violations in many countries. People belonging to this minority are more likely to be victims of discrimination and ill-treatment. In many countries, sexual orientation and gender identity is a reason not only for criminal prosecution, but also for inhuman treatment, torture or even the imposition of the death penalty, which is totally unacceptable for us. Such a violation of human rights is incompatible with the fundamental principles of the European Union and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to which every person should have the same rights without any discrimination. I therefore also welcome the UN resolution, which is the first of its kind in general to be devoted specifically to violations of human rights based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and which thus demonstrates the universality of human rights. It supports open dialogue in this area, and I firmly believe that the EU should take a unified approach to the application of human rights when carrying out both its external and its internal activities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of the slightly more than 100 MEPs who voted against this motion for a resolution. I did so not because I do not support the complete and utter condemnation of homophobia, or because I do not agree that the European Union should be the first to abide by its Charter of Fundamental Rights. Rather, it is because I believe that that which has been included in paragraph 11, as Ms Mazzoni also said, is a surreptitious attempt – it is a film that we see over and over again.</p>
      <p sl="it">For every time we talk about topics that broadly or roughly relate to the issue of gender recognition, there is always someone who, for political ends or to push through a law on the recognition of non-male or non-female genders that he or she thinks Europe should impose on the Member States, introduces points that have nothing to do with what is being discussed.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that this Europe that is trying to introduce legislation on something that departs from the laws of nature that created men and women is a Europe that should seek to re-examine its position and that should do more to safeguard everyone’s civil and sexual rights rather than take advantage of items such as this to introduce points that are completely extraneous to this issue.</p>

With our fences, armies and trenches, not only do we not have democratic Member States and a democratic EU, not only are we undermining international aquis , agreements and human rights; we are also failing to provide a solution to the problem.

The high migratory pressure felt in this region has led to the need to step up Union action taken through the External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund.

      <p sl="pt">The 2011 EU budget was definitively adopted on 15 December 2010. Throughout the first six months of 2011, the EU helped the political changes of the Arab Spring in several countries of the southern Mediterranean, where a number of peoples, supported by the EU, overthrew decades-old totalitarian regimes. These events sparked significant migratory flows towards other countries, specifically in southern Europe. As this extraordinary expenditure had not been foreseen, on 17 July 2011, pursuant to Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission tabled Draft amending budget No 4, which the Council adopted on 12 September 2011. This draft amending budget includes a reinforcement of EUR 41.1 million in commitment appropriations and payment appropriations for the External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund, so as to finance transnational actions in emergency situations, to which can be added a EUR 54 million reinforcement of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) for maritime security.

      <p sl="en">The most recent developments in the southern Mediterranean have brought huge migratory pressure on the region. Under the March 2011 resolutions of the European Council, the proposed strengthening of EU measures within the External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund will make it possible to bolster the immediate efforts of the most affected Member States and to strengthen the capacity of Frontex to carry out marine surveillance in the Mediterranean. The basic documents of the External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund assume that out of their total funding package, a certain percentage is allocated for Community measures to fund supra-national measures or measures that are in the interest of the Community as a whole, particularly in the case of emergency situations where quick action is needed. The extraordinary nature of the current events in the southern Mediterranean constitute an emergency for the Member States affected, which is why the Commission has proposed increasing the quota allocated for Community measures to the maximum amounts set out in the relevant basic documents. Maximising this quota involves increasing the budgetary funds for all three funds and these funds should be released above all for Italy, Greece Malta and Cyprus to help them deal with the current situation.</p>

      <p sl="it">I can only support the resolution we have just adopted on the increase in the draft budget for the management of migration and refugee flows following the events in North Africa. Precisely because this is one of the everyday problems we are facing at present, there is an acute need for strong and determined action that sees the whole of Europe united in its development and support and that rules out any other approach. In future, we should prevent situations such as those which occurred in Italy a few months ago, when the country was confronted with an uncontrollable situation, with an island such as Lampedusa being invaded by men, women and children fleeing a disastrous, war-torn environment. In those few days, the concept of European solidarity wavered, when it should instead be one of our priorities. Common, concerted action, with EU resources to manage migration flows, will not only benefit the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, but will also be an effective means of helping all the Member States.</p>

The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment.

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Ms Matera, concerns the proposal for a decision of Parliament and the Council on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), in accordance with point 28 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (application EGF/2010/003 DE/Arnsberg and Düsseldorf automotive from Germany). In July 2011, the Commission adopted a new proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the EGF for Germany in order to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant owing to the global financial and economic crisis, following the aforementioned application, submitted on 9 February 2010. This is the 15th proposal for the mobilisation of the EGF submitted under the 2011 EU budget, mobilising EUR 4 347 868, and its purpose is to mitigate the social impact of the redundancies of 778 workers from five ‘Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers’ companies in the NUTS II level regions of Arnsberg (DEA5) and Düsseldorf (DEA1) in Germany, already hit very hard by the redundancies from Nokia (Bochum) and the closure of General Motors.

      <p sl="pt">Another plenary sitting, another application for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. This time the application has been made by Germany to help reintegrate into the labour market 778 workers made redundant from five companies in Division 29 in Germany, during the nine-month reference period of 1 March 2010 to 1 December 2010. It refers to the mobilisation of a total sum of EUR 4 347 868.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This application reminds us that no country’s workers are protected from the effects of the crisis of capitalism. We voted for this application for mobilisation so that the redundant workers do not lack the proper support. However, we would criticise once again the fact that recourse to this instrument has been necessary. Furthermore, we are bound to point out another issue in this case. The sum approved is disproportionately larger than that mobilised for Portugal, where many hundreds of workers were also made redundant from Rohde.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This confirms that the criticisms we have always made of the profoundly unfair criteria of the EGF and its regulation are justified, as it is harmful in relative terms to the more vulnerable countries that are currently facing the greatest difficulties.</p>

As such, although we are voting in favour in both cases so as not to harm the workers involved, we would once again flag up the deeply unfair criteria of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>

This is a very significant sum of money – EUR 4.3 million – and it will help to support the 778 redundant workers. Many of the personalised services, such as training courses leading to qualifications, in-depth guidance for business start-ups and short-term job seekers allowances will assist redundant workers in their re-integration into employment. Given that 10% of redundant workers across the EU received assistance from the EGF in 2010, it indicates the need for the continuation of this fund and, indeed, its expansion.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in order to provide additional assistance to workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns. On 9 February 2011, Germany submitted an application to mobilise the EGF in respect of 778 workers made redundant from five enterprises involved in the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers in the regions of Arnsberg and Düsseldorf. One of the Commission’s assessment criteria is the existence of a link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis. This particular case involves decreased demand for new motor vehicles in the European Union as a result of the global financial and economic crisis. According to the German authorities, the 778 redundancies covered by this application will further add to the high level of unemployment in the regions of Arnsberg and Düsseldorf, already seriously affected by the end of operations at the Nokia plant in Bochum and the closure of General Motors. The coordinated package of personalised services to be funded, including its compatibility with actions funded by the Structural Funds, includes measures for short-term job search allowances, training courses, in-depth guidance for business start-up, workshops and peer group seminars, labour market guidance, stimulation of activity, and placement research, and so on.</p>

One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis, which in this particular case is related to the decreased demand for new motor vehicles in the European Union as a result of the global financial and economic crisis.

This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of company relocations that occur within a globalised context. More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers’ rights. The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment. The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Germany, which has applied for assistance with regard to 778 cases of redundancy, all of which are eligible to receive support, at five companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 29 ‘Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers’ in the NUTS II regions of Arnsberg (DEA5) and Düsseldorf (DEA1).</p>

The EGF provides additional support to workers who are suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and assists their reintegration into the labour market. Germany has submitted an application for EGF funds for redundancies in the automotive sector, which fulfil the eligibility criteria set up by the EGF Regulation. Now it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, despite the fact that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor measures restructuring companies or sectors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although I have great sympathy for redundant workers wherever they are in the world, I believe that UK taxpayers’ money, which provides a significant contribution to the EU and thus Global Adjustment Fund budget, is better concentrated on providing jobs for unemployed workers in the UK. Unemployment in the UK continues to rise to unexpected levels. Many of our heavy industries have shut down and our workforce is inundated with EU migrants. It is a slap in the face to hardworking Brits who have lost their jobs in industries that have relocated to other EU countries under EU law to then find that their contributions as taxpayers are being spent by the EU in assisting unemployed people in Portugal. Increasingly the UK is becoming a hub for people who have fled their own EU Member States to try to earn more money or claim benefits in the UK, which they often send large proportions of back home rather than inject it into the local economy. As unemployment continues to rise in the UK, particularly blighting some of the former mining towns in Wales, I cannot justify assenting to aid newly unemployed workers abroad when long-term unemployed people continue to suffer in communities in my constituency.</p>

This request is aimed at supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant from Rohde; a total of 974 redundancies, 680 of whom are targeted for assistance. The total amount is EUR 1 449 500. The story behind these redundancies is, sadly, like many others.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report mentions that the company was bought by a joint venture between Square Four and the merchant bank Morgan Stanley in an attempt to save Rohde and its level of production. The factory in Portugal was planned to remain in production. However, as in so many similar cases, workers began to be made redundant. In addition to these circumstances, orders from the parent enterprise declined, which affected the situation of the Rohde factory in Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal, and as a result, insolvency proceedings started in September 2009, leading to the eventual closure of the factory and the dismissal of the workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Once again, I would denounce the unfair criteria of this fund and its regulation. Germany has submitted an application for a similar number of workers, and has been granted the mobilisation of an amount approximately three times greater than that mobilised for Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The decision to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for Portugal is aimed at supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant, at a total amount of EUR 1 449 500, for 974 redundancies, 680 of whom are targeted for assistance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Portuguese Government submitted the application to the Commission at the end of 2010. The document mentions that the company was bought in an attempt to save Rohde, and the factory in Portugal was supposed to remain in production. However, workers began to be made redundant, and orders from the parent company declined, which affected the situation of the Rohde factory based in Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal, and as a result, insolvency proceedings started in September 2009, leading to the eventual closure of the factory and the dismissal of the workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When we assessed this proposal in the Working Group of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of which I am a member, I highlighted the injustice of the fact that this mobilisation for Portugal amounts to only EUR 1.4 million, whereas in identical situations EUR 3.9 million were mobilised for Denmark, and approximately EUR 4.4 million for Germany.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was created in order to provide additional assistance to workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns. On 17 August 2011, the Commission adopted a new proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the EGF in favour of Portugal in order to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis. One of the Commission’s assessment criteria is the existence of a link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis. In this particular case, Portugal argues that the clothing and footwear industries have been strongly hit by the crisis. These sectors are very vulnerable to external factors such as the loss of consumer purchasing power. The economic recession has had a negative impact on the labour market, unemployment levels have risen, and this has affected consumer confidence. The coordinated package of personalised services to be funded, including its compatibility with actions funded by the Structural Funds, includes measures for re-integrating the workers into the labour market: information and guidance, recognition, validation and certification of competences, vocational training, grants for training at personal initiative, support for self-placement, entrepreneurial support, support for business start-up, and integration plans, and so forth.</p>

Both clothing and footwear industries recorded a decrease in exports (EUR 24 million in clothing, EUR 6 million in footwear).

The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment. The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Portugal, which has requested assistance with regard to 974 redundancies, 680 of which are targeted for assistance, at a company located mainly in the municipality of Santa Maria da Feira, and which has also affected the contiguous municipality of Ovar, both located respectively within the two NUTS II regions of Norte and Centro, in Portugal.</p>

Rohde – Sociedade Industrial de Calçado Luso-Alemã, Lda – is a footwear manufacturing company which decided to cease trading, resulting in 974 workers being made redundant.

I am voting for this report as I believe that the funds granted to Portugal, to a total of EUR 1.4 million, or 65% of the total budgeted value, will make a key contribution to the professional reintegration of the workers. The intention is for them to participate in vocational training and recognition of competences, and that they will have access to grants for entrepreneurial support.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because its objective is to conclude an agreement with Argentina including Bulgaria and Romania. In order to meet WTO requirements two issues are addressed in the agreements. Firstly, the compensation of higher tariffs which are to be compensated. The method most often used is to open country allocated tariff rate quota or increase existing ones. Secondly, the pre accession erga omnes tariff rate quota for Bulgaria and Romania (not country-allocated but open to the whole world) also needs to be added to the existing erga omnes tariff rate quota for the EU. This agreement concerns boneless meat of bovine animals (Argentina), boneless buffalo meat (Argentina), as well as erga omnes increases in the tariff rate quota for common wheat, barley, malting barley and maize. Argentina is entitled to a restoration of its trading rights, which were eroded slightly due to the enlargement of the EU customs union to include Romania and Bulgaria. The purpose of a customs union or free-trade area should be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to trade with other countries that have concluded agreements with these territories. This agreement is another sign that the EU wishes to respect the rules of the multilateral trading regime.

      <p sl="sk">Argentina is entitled to renew its trading rules as these were substantially distorted as a result of the expansion of the EU Customs Union to include Romania and Bulgaria. The EU wants to observe the multilateral trading rules and take collective preparatory measures to achieve the comprehensive agreement made at the Doha Development Round. EU enlargement is, generally speaking, of benefit to the members of the WTO. If the acceding countries had higher customs tariffs than the EU tariffs, this was because the WTO required them. Otherwise, where they had lower tariffs than the EU tariffs and they now have to increase them, the EU will make up the difference. That is a general requirement of WTO membership.</p>

I voted for the report for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="pt">With the enlargement of the EU to Bulgaria and Romania, it has become necessary, in terms of external policy, to reformulate agreements on tariff arrangements concluded with third countries. According to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, ‘the purpose of a customs union or of a free-trade area should be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other contracting parties with such territories’. The aim of the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and New Zealand falls within the context of renegotiation, with a view to rebalancing the range of rights of both contracting parties, within the framework of the common tariff quota. The products concerned in this agreement are the meat of sheep or goats, and high-quality beef. I voted in favour because I agree with the aim of this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="sk">With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the EU has enlarged its customs union. Consequently, the EU was obliged under WTO rules to enter into negotiations with WTO Members with negotiating rights in the schedules of any of the acceding Members in order to agree on compensatory adjustment. The aim is to agree on a mutually satisfactory compensatory adjustment in order to offset the increase in bound duties. Both parties have an interest in reaching agreement. On 29 January 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV(6) of GATT with countries eligible for compensation. The Council initialled the agreement with New Zealand on 7 September 2010. On 11 April 2011, the Council authorised the signature. The signing of the agreement with New Zealand took place on 28 April 2011. To meet WTO requirements, two issues are addressed in the agreements. Firstly, the compensation of higher tariffs which are to be compensated while secondly, the pre-accession tariff rate quota of Bulgaria and Romania also needs to be added to the existing erga omnes tariff rate quota of the EU. I welcome the agreement with New Zealand and am of the opinion that the European Parliament should approve it. New Zealand is entitled to renew the rules of its trading regime as this was substantially distorted as a result of the enlargement of the European customs union to include Romania and Bulgaria.</p>

Parliament is giving its opinion here on the said ‘six pack or ‘governance package’, which contains six legislative proposals aimed at strengthening European economic governance. The Wortmann-Kool report sets out to amend and strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact which, in its current form, has proved inadequate. This report includes preventive measures which should make it possible to anticipate any future crisis. Thus, it seeks to enhance budgetary discipline by monitoring increases in State expenditure, by introducing a ‘European Semester’ where European and national politicians will meet to discuss economic issues. The European Commission will also be able to issue recommendations to the Member States.

The intention is to prevent budget deficits and excessive debt at an early stage, and to promote the surveillance and coordination of economic policy, thus helping the Union hit its growth and jobs targets. Parliament will be involved in the European Semester, in order to increase the transparency, ownership and accountability of the decisions taken, specifically through economic dialogue. The Council will be obliged to publicly justify its reasoning in Parliament whenever it does not follow the Commission’s recommendations in relation to situations where the Stability and Growth Pact has been contravened.

The current budget deficit crisis has highlighted that the EU cannot function properly only on the basis of trust. In fact, solidarity without any supervision and control mechanisms can destroy the trust of citizens in some Member States in European integration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The balance struck between the financial adjustment mechanisms and social aspects ought to have resulted in all the political groups voting in favour.

Thus, new policies for reducing government spending on social policies and cutting back on labour and social rights are being promoted. The Commission’s absolute control over fiscal policies and sanctions of an economic and political nature are maximising the democratic deficit in the European Union.

It contains important measures protecting social rights, ensuring that a wide range of potential economic imbalances will be monitored. There is a clear alternative to brute austerity. We need a broader and more ambitious agenda for the euro zone. We need an alternative economic governance scheme that includes: 1. A European Growth and Jobs Pact to promote investment, recovery, growth and jobs as well as restoring public finances. 2. Stronger and more democratic decision-making arrangements, so that Europe can respond promptly and effectively. 3. A strong system of eurobonds to stabilise markets and lower interest rates. 4.

      <p sl="sk">Coordinating the economic policies of Member States within the EU should entail compliance with the guiding principles of stable prices, sound public finances and monetary conditions and a sustainable balance of payments. The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound public finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and sustainable growth and leading to the creation of new jobs. The preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact requires that Member States should achieve and maintain a medium-term budgetary objective and submit stability and convergence programmes to that effect. Adherence to the medium-term budgetary objective should allow Member States to have a safety margin with respect to the 3% of GDP reference value in order to ensure a rapid progress towards stability and to have room for budgetary manoeuvre, in particular taking into account the need for public investment. The obligation to achieve and maintain the medium-term budgetary objective needs to be put into operation through the specification of principles of prudent fiscal policy-making. In order to ensure compliance with the fiscal surveillance framework a specific enforcement mechanism should be established for cases where a persistent and significant deviation from prudent fiscal policy-making prevails. The recommendations of Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 must take into account the renumbering of the articles in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which is why I believe that the Regulation should be appropriately amended.</p>

      <p sl="de">In the context of the current financial and economic crisis, it is relatively hard to understand how the Council can act as the sum of the different national interests in the financial debates, instead of finally coming to a decision on a joint position. Budgetary discipline is one of these sensitive subjects. In good times the countries call for this type of discipline and in bad times they want to avoid it.</p>

      <p sl="it">In voting against the Wortmann-Kool report, and in fact against the entire ‘governance package’, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is not saying ‘no’ to more robust and stringent European rules on the fiscal policies of the Member States, but is expressing its opposition to a specific line of economic policy: a line focused solely on budgetary discipline, and therefore an inadequate response to the current serious economic and financial crisis. As a condition of its support for the package, the S&amp;D Group had requested the introduction of a golden rule to ‘save’ productive investment from swingeing cuts. The alliance between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Euro-sceptic conservatives of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, backed by the Council, has made it inevitable that we would vote against by rejecting this potential compromise, which opposes a line that is destined to exacerbate the sovereign debt crisis and to hit both social cohesion and growth prospects in Europe hard.</p>

By restricting itself to a punitive approach alone, the economic governance package straitjackets the Member States into austerity policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Instead of guaranteeing policies for recovery, that support consumption and investment for the future, this package is making the people pay for the crisis, by stifling growth and destroying jobs, and will consequently prevent any return to balanced budgets. The consolidation of public finances must be accompanied by a policy for growth and recovery, and this economic governance package is nothing other than an abdication in the face of the all-powerful financial markets and credit-rating agencies. There is another way forward; the European right will have to accept the heavy responsibility for not having chosen it.</p>

      <p sl="de">We adopt regulations which are binding on the Member States and on taxpayers, on citizens and on society. Despite the fact that this may seem necessary in terms of fiscal and economic policy in a monetary union, at the same time it involves a dramatic restriction of freedom and democracy. The decisions made in this way will have a major impact on hundreds of millions of people over the next few years. They will result in cuts in social security spending, wages and pensions and they will put a stop to necessary investment in the future of our countries. As far as sustainability, intergenerational justice and cooperation in financial and economic policy are concerned, this should be welcomed. However, as long as we regard these savings as the response to the financial crisis of the last few years and do not tackle its real causes, this will be a fatal solution that affects the wrong people and continues to expose our community and the public budgets to the world of financial speculation, which is still not adequately regulated. On their own, the measures which have been decided on do not yet represent the treatment. Instead, they are continuing the scandalous situation which is leading to a huge reallocation from the taxpayers to the banks, from the public to the private sector, from the funding for investment, culture and social services into the pockets of irresponsible financial agencies, from the real economy, from the productively employed and the service providers to the investors who do not provide a service, from the future to the past.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because the economic and financial crisis has exposed the need to review the framework for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) with a view to enforcing existing instruments and broadening the procedures for coordination and multilateral surveillance. The economic governance package comprises six proposals aimed at reinforcing the coordination and surveillance of economic policies in the EMU, taking into account the Europe 2020 strategy and the European Semester, which is a new surveillance cycle under the Stability and Growth Pact and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Two of the proposals in question are concerned with the excessive deficit procedure. The other four concern the multilateral surveillance procedure. This proposal for a regulation sets out provisions ensuring the pursuit of prudent fiscal policies and the sustainability of public finance in the Member States. Despite this precise framework, the current economic context shows that progress towards achieving medium-term budgetary objectives has generally been insufficient. Moreover, the structural balance has in practice proved an insufficient measure of a country`s underlying fiscal position. Consequently, the proposed regulation provides for detailed rules to ensure the coordination of the economic policies and economic performance of Member States.</p>

I am proud that although Poland is not a member of the euro area, it has taken an active part in the search for solutions and agreement. It is characteristic that the opposition in different countries is trying to deprecate the provisions of the ‘six pack’. Party interests are winning over judicious concern for the common good – what a pity. The socialists voted against, which means they voted against the people. Failure to react to the crisis will hit at ordinary citizens. This is not socially-minded action – quite the contrary. Tackling the crisis should be our shared objective.

The Commission has to take the lead in this issue, with Member States who are unable to fulfil the necessary economic criteria taking responsibility.</p>

This package is about forcing the Member States to keep their deficit under 3% of GDP and their public debt under 60% of GDP. As a result, national budgets will be monitored and assessed early on by the Commission and the Member States; this is what is referred to as the European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, recommendations will be given if debt reduction policies are not complied with. And if there is no improvement, the ‘bad pupils’ will be threatened with a demand to deposit funds equivalent to 0.2% of their GDP, and this deposit will turn into a fine if the ‘bad pupil’ refuses to follow the rules.</p>

While these have been written into the ‘six pack’, this has been done without great conviction. Our only point of disagreement is with the cuts and sacrifices themselves. The sacrifices and cuts are going to affect public employees, people working as hired labourers, business people and, indirectly, people living on old age and disability pensions. Along with my political group I want a new economic and financial policy for the Union – including taxation of financial transactions and the issue of EU project and stabilisation bonds.

This regulation makes it possible to issue recommendations and demand contributions from Member States who fail to stick to their medium-term fiscal consolidation targets, including if their results are in compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (3% deficit, 60% of GDP). I have not supported the regulation because:</p>

Controlling government expenditure will lead to degrowth and recession, rather than stimulating measures, as they should, in order to generate economic development and protect the most disadvantaged who, even though they are not responsible for this crisis, are paying for it and will continue to do so.

It will at last ensure the viability of the single currency and restore the markets’ confidence.

      <p sl="pl">I would like to express my satisfaction in connection with today’s adoption by Parliament of the ‘six pack’. The economic crisis, the effects of which we are still feeling, has demonstrated that the current system for the financial discipline of the Member States has been a complete failure. The Stability and Growth Pact, which was intended to guarantee that the countries of the euro area would continue to meet the convergence criteria, has proved in reality to be just wishful thinking. The way the European Commission turned a blind eye to the violation of the pact over many years has ultimately led to the greatest crisis in the history of the single currency. The package of legislative measures adopted today creates a new quality in the coordination of the EU’s economies. In my opinion, a key question is that of giving the EU an instrument which allows it to react to the excessive debt of a Member State. As we know, in accordance with the Treaty of Maastricht the level of public debt of a country in the euro area should not exceed 60% of GDP. However, in the case of Greece, for example, this indicator currently stands at nearly 150%. The establishment of a framework for controlling Member States’ budgetary expenses is also a very good measure – in accordance with the package it will be possible to increase these limits only in proportion to growth in GDP. This should prevent situations in which Member States are living on credit. The one thing which may cause dissatisfaction in the ‘six pack’ we have adopted is the none-too rigorous system of sanctions and control over Member States which do not maintain fiscal discipline.</p>

      <p sl="es">This ‘economic governance package’ closes some of the gaps that exist in the area of real economic governance in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="es">Although it is late in coming, Parliament believes it to be necessary, and it is a step in the direction that I support as a Europeanist and federalist. All the same, while the package does resolve some issues, it is still a timid solution, bearing in mind the scope of the crisis we are facing.</p>
      <p sl="es">In that respect, I regret the slow progress made in the areas of financial market regulation (sovereign debt speculation, credit default swaps, controlling bank bonuses and hedge funds, and so on); European fiscal policy that harmonises corporation tax at the very least; and a policy that stimulates job creation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also regret the shy glance cast at the lost revenue that would be considerably higher if a serious attempt were made to combat tax evasion and fraud, and if the tax havens that still remain among us were closed. The report also fails to tackle the organisation of an independent European credit rating service.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, the European Parliament needs to play a greater role in the mechanism for budgetary surveillance and correction that we are adopting today.</p>

      <p sl="en">The ECR has always supported the eurozone’s efforts to find a way out of the crisis and to ensure that it does not happen again. It is regrettable, however, that the chosen way of doing so requires that the whole of the EU, and not just the eurozone, must be subject to the new and intrusive powers that have been handed to the Commission through the economic governance package. The ECR cooperated fully to make the new system as effective, accountable and transparent as possible and to reduce its impact on the Member States outside the eurozone. It is a shame that governmental profligacy and contempt for the Stability and Growth Pact has required such a system to be put in place, and we hope that all Member States have now learnt that fiscal prudence is essential at all times, and not just when times are bad. Even though we have not been able to support this report, we hope that Parliament’s vote will go some way towards restoring the faith of the markets that proper action is being taken. But from now on, it is for the eurozone to sort out the mess in which it finds itself.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At today’s vote, MEPs from the Polish Law and Justice party endorsed the six legislative acts which are intended to tighten control over the budgetary and economic policies of the Member States in order to provide better protection against macroeconomic upheavals and also to make the procedure for the control of excessive budget deficit more effective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be pointed out that the new instruments do not represent a complete prescription for the crisis in the euro area. Furthermore, there is a risk that the new powers could be used in a way which will mean that Europe’s competitiveness, instead of benefiting, will suffer. The Member States must above all avoid the spread of inappropriate measures across the whole of the EU in the area of labour, budgetary or fiscal policy. For Poland, the next few years must be a period of careful investigation as to whether the new mechanisms are having a beneficial effect on the competitiveness of our economies. Only the outcome of this crisis test of the euro area will determine the route for Poland’s adoption of the single currency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The final vote on the so-called ‘six pack’ is a clear signal that the European Union is seeking to avoid future sovereign debt through preventive and corrective mechanisms, and in particular to avoid budget deficits and excessive debt. A single currency area requires the application of concerted economic and financial policies, namely the creation of European economic governance. This report therefore aims to strengthen the instruments of the Stability and Growth Pact, giving greater emphasis to the criterion of public debt with a specific limit of 60% of gross domestic product. The changes include the institutionalisation of the European Semester, with the strengthening of the economic dialogue between the institutions and the Member States, and the inclusion of the objectives set out by the EU in the national reform programmes. The objective of including the mechanism of reversed qualified majority voting in the Council in all stages of assessment process has not been possible. Parliament has nevertheless insisted on the need for this procedure in cases where the Member State does not take appropriate measures to combat its debt and deficit. This report is therefore the first of many steps that the EU needs to take towards making itself a strong and cohesive economic bloc that is capable of responding to economic and financial shocks.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted against the report on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies because the whole economic governance package only introduces austerity measures and does not give Member States the chance to invest in economic growth and job creation measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission’s proposal stipulates that each Member State should submit its national reform programme annually by 30 April. The Council assesses, based on the Commission’s recommendation, whether the planned policy actions and the economic assumptions on which the national reform programmes are based are plausible. In the case of Member States outside the euro area, the Commission and Council monitor the implementation of the convergence programmes to identify significant discrepancies between the budgetary position and the medium-term budgetary objective. In the event of a significant deviation from the adjustment path towards achieving the medium-term objective, the Commission issues a warning to the relevant Member State, while the Council adopts a recommendation for policy measures within a month, whereby a deadline is set of five months for rectifying the deviation.</p>

What it does, ultimately, is give the politicians the possibility of imposing sanctions on euro sinners. That is undesirable, in my opinion: we should be able to impose sanctions automatically without any interference from the politicians. However, it is essential that the six pack is adopted in its entirety. In the unlikely event of it being rejected, the euro crisis will peak before long.

It is easier and less costly to anticipate and deal thoroughly with the problems early on than to address them superficially afterwards. That is the whole point of this directive, the aim of which is to ensure transparency, responsibility and budgetary coordination within the euro area. To avoid the errors of the past, we are taking our responsibilities by introducing a preventive aspect to the monitoring process, which appears to me as the necessary complement to the corrective aspect. The Commission will have the legitimacy to carry out this monitoring and will consequently be able to warn the countries that are not complying with the rules they accepted. The objective remains to take the bull by the horns while there is still time, before the sovereign debt crisis reaches the scale it did in Greece. In my opinion, these measures are an indispensable step towards shoring up our single currency and getting back on the path to growth and stability.</p>

Consistently linking related policies will safeguard growth in the long term and subject the financial markets to increased regulation and surveillance.

It was an illusion to think that the single currency and single market could go hand in hand with national approaches to economic and budgetary policy. This means we are on the verge of economic and fiscal union. However, when Slovakia joined the euro area, nobody mentioned the loss of sovereignty in budgetary, taxation and economic policy matters.

I think that additional incentives and sanctions are required to make the enforcement of budgetary surveillance more effective. These sanctions should enhance the credibility of the European Union’s budgetary surveillance framework, and the incentives should reinforce compliance with the legislation.

If these measures prove insufficient, they will have to pay a fine. The interest on the deposits and the revenue from the fines will be allocated to the European Financial Stability Facility and then to the European Stability Mechanism, which is due to replace it in 2013. The European Parliament is involved with these budgetary monitoring measures in the context of the ‘economic dialogue’. In this way, the Member State affected by the sanctions will be able to have its say before Parliament over its budgetary situation.

      <p sl="cs">Member States whose currency is the euro should conduct economic policies that promote the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, and should avoid policies that jeopardise it. To ensure the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, the Treaty allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area which go beyond the provisions applicable to all Member States. In my opinion, additional sanctions are necessary to make the enforcement of budgetary surveillance more effective in the euro area. These sanctions should enhance the credibility of the fiscal surveillance framework of the Union. Sanctions for Member States whose currency is the euro in the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact should provide incentives for prudent fiscal policy-making. Such policy-making should ensure that the growth rate of government expenditure does not normally exceed a prudent medium-term growth rate of gross domestic product. I applaud the fact that, in the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact, sanctions for Member States whose currency is the euro should take the form of an obligation to lodge a non-interest-bearing deposit linked to a Council decision establishing the existence of an excessive deficit and an obligation to pay a fine in the event of non-compliance with a Council recommendation to correct an excessive government deficit.

      <p sl="ro">The euro area is going through a deep crisis at the moment due to the deficient foundations on which the euro area has been built. The Stability and Growth Pact is a particularly useful instrument for maintaining budgetary discipline. However, it has been applied inappropriately, resulting in the appearance of the current macroeconomic imbalances. In order not only to avoid such situations in the future, but also to regain the confidence of the financial markets in the single currency, a series of structural reforms needs to be carried out to remedy the weaknesses in the budgetary surveillance system in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the agreement which has been reached provides such improvements. One area where the biggest progress has been made is the use of reversed qualified majority voting when sanctions are imposed for failure to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact.

      <p sl="pt">I voted against the report on the surveillance of budgetary positions in the euro area, as it forms part of a legislative package on economic governance, whose measures concentrate almost exclusively on austerity and sanctions, which will have extremely negative consequences for the European economy and the European public. Austerity alone will not solve the crisis in the euro area. There is a need for policies to consolidate public finances which promote smart growth, social cohesion and jobs, and which provide, specifically, for the creation of a system of Eurobonds and a financial transaction tax.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I should like to emphasise what I consider to be this report’s most significant step forward: the possibility of creating a system that is not just based on the sanctions aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), but that, by contrast, enables the introduction of real incentives that lead to and develop a genuine will in the governments of the Member States to comply with the rules laid down in the SGP. In this sense, I would highlight the future tabling of a report by the Commission on the issuance of sovereign bonds under joint and several liability. I should also like to stress the extraordinary work undertaken here, with the institutionalisation of economic dialogue between the various European institutions, as well as the promotion of participation by national parliaments and governments in a genuine democratic debate about economic policy. Finally, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Ms Goulard, on her work and commitment in getting the most out of this package.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Ms Goulard, concerns the proposal for a regulation of Parliament and the Council on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area. The current economic and financial situation of various Member States demonstrates the ineffectiveness of plans for the Stability and Growth Pact, so besides the need for rigorous monitoring of the public deficit within the principles defined by the Treaty of Maastricht, it has become vital to monitor the public and private debt. The European institutions have been doing everything they can to help Member States out of the crisis. However, they have to be more rigorous with their public finances. It is unacceptable that some countries are falsifying their statistics in order to deceive the EU. I therefore welcome the strengthening of coordination and surveillance mechanisms that increase the oversight of budgets of the Member States – so as to prevent them from making major errors in their budgetary policy that could jeopardise the very economic and monetary union – and especially monitoring agencies, as well as the introduction of a set of sanctions for all Member States with budgetary imbalances. This is the only way we will successfully achieve greater development and economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The global financial and economic crisis has highlighted and strengthened the need for closer coordination and better surveillance of economic policy in the Economic and Monetary Union. The present tools and methods for coordination and surveillance have allowed the EU to deal with a crisis that no Member State would have been able to manage on its own. Europe’s institutions and Member States responded swiftly and are continuing with their joint efforts to recover from a crisis, the likes of which our generation has not seen before. Member States which use the euro have a special interest in and responsibility for implementing an economic policy that supports the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union and preventing politicians who oppose it. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 136 in conjunction with Article 121(6) allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area which go beyond the provisions applicable to all Member States for the purpose of ensuring the proper functioning of economic and monetary union. Additional sanctions are necessary to make the enforcement of budgetary surveillance more effective in the euro area. These sanctions should encourage prudence in fiscal policy-making. This would make it possible to achieve and maintain a medium-term budgetary objective and ensure rapid progress towards fiscal sustainability, while allowing room for budgetary manoeuvre, in particular for public investment.</p>

These measures alone will certainly not solve Europe’s problems once and for all, but they provide the first bases of what we should be aiming for.

      <p sl="fr">Instead of guaranteeing policies for recovery that support consumption and investment for the future, this package is making the people pay for the crisis, by stifling growth and destroying jobs, and will consequently prevent any return to balanced budgets. The consolidation of public finances must be accompanied by a policy for growth and recovery, and this economic governance package is nothing other than an abdication in the face of the all-powerful financial markets and credit-rating agencies. There is another way forward; the European right will have to accept the heavy responsibility for not having chosen it.</p>

      <p sl="de">The analyses on which this report and the entire ‘six pack’ are based do not go far enough. The same applies to the measures that have been taken. It is correct that a monetary union is not viable without a solid fiscal policy and sufficient economic convergence between the member countries. However, it is also correct that the current crisis was triggered when the EU Member States and the European Central Bank began supporting banks and financial institutions which had become unstable as a result of irresponsible speculation using hundreds of billions of euros of taxpayers’ money. In my opinion, this will not bring the crisis to an end or curtail the speculation. Instead, it will just fan the flames. The state guarantees will result in the speculation continuing at a low risk and with obscene profit margins. In the meantime, this speculation is now mainly directed against the states themselves. We cannot and will not win the race that has been started in this way, unless we put in place new and fair rules. These will definitely not include pocketing the profits of speculation while burdening taxpayers with losses of billions of euros. Instead, they will include, among other things, restructuring debt with a pro rata write-off by creditors, linking risk and liability, separating commercial and investment banks and only rescuing the commercial banks (which do not need rescuing anyway), but letting the casino banks go bankrupt, raising the capital requirements, limiting leverage, stricter regulation of the financial markets and a financial transaction tax.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European debt crisis has been a reminder to us of what happens if people do not keep to common rules. The Stability and Growth Pact, which was drawn up to prop up the euro, has been neglected – recklessly, and even with relish. When we have left the current maelstrom behind us, with or without style points, we will hopefully have learned something from what happened.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The legislative package before us indicates a healthy change in our way of thinking. Especially welcome, I think, are the default position by the Council of Ministers on the passing of sanctions as a result of breaches and the decision requiring a qualified majority to abrogate them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Financial sanctions for poor management of finances, however, are not the best possible approach. They basically make it harder for the renegade country to reach the permitted limit values, besides which the loopholes intended to lighten the burden reduce the likelihood that sanctions will be put into effect, to the extent that the real deterrent effect of sanctions is questionable. That is why I think it is a worthwhile option for a Member State to lose its right to vote in the Council, either partially or fully, in situations in which financial sanctions would not be an effective solution.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although Ms Goulard’s report is largely a step in the right direction, I must vote against it, because it shows support for the so-called Eurobonds. I would like to remind everyone that it is laid down at Treaty level, and for a good reason, that Member States are not liable for each other’s commitments, nor will they assume responsibility for them. The deployment of supranational bonds would be a glaring contradiction of this point in the Treaty. Ultimately, each Member State must earn the trust of the markets by being responsible for its own solvency and by bringing its economy into balance.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for the excellent report by my colleague Sylvie Goulard on budgetary surveillance in the euro area. It is a crucial component of the legislative package on reforming economic governance, known as the ‘six-pack’ in European jargon. The report’s key proposal is worded as follows: ‘Member States whose currency is the euro should pool up to [ …] per cent of the sovereign debt under joint and several liabilities (Eurosecurities).’</p>
      <p sl="fr">This key idea has been advocated for months by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and calls for the creation of Eurobonds, in other words a pooling of the debt and the ability for countries currently undergoing austerity to borrow at reasonable rates on the markets. Of course, pooling the debt will not get rid of it. It goes without saying that Greece, like the other countries at risk, must first start stabilising their public finances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, beyond the Member States having to bear reduced financial costs, the greatest strength of Eurobonds certainly lies in promoting the euro as a safe-haven currency. This is a credible alternative to the dollar since 25% of Chinese foreign exchange reserves are already in the European currency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Given the Greek crisis and the worrying situation of several other Member States with large deficits, it is essential to ensure that, in future, compliance to budgetary discipline is a reality. I am relieved that the long months of fierce negotiations on the ‘governance package’ between Parliament and the Council have finally succeeded, even though I would have preferred this to happen sooner, of course. This regulation, relating to budgetary surveillance in the euro area, establishes a system of sanctions – a deposit of 0.2% of GDP of the Member State at fault, with or without interest – with a view to ensuring better compliance with the preventive and corrective aspects of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is also aimed at combating false information provided by the Member States regarding their public deficit or their public debt, with a range of fines for those who are found out. It should also be noted that the text asks the Commission to submit to Parliament and to the Council, by the end of 2011, a report on the possibility of issuing Eurobonds. I eagerly await the Commission’s next moves on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Commission should play a more important coordination role in the enhanced surveillance procedures. However, I think that we cannot stipulate in the text of a regulation that countries in a weaker economic or budgetary position should pay a premium/higher interest rate or be entitled to borrow a lower proportion of GDP in Eurosecurities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, I think that making a Member State with an excessive deficit lodge a non-interest-bearing deposit amounting to 0.2% of GDP or even imposing a fine of 0.2% of GDP on a Member State with an excessive deficit, where the Council considers that this state has not taken effective action in response to its recommendations within the stipulated period, are merely extremely harsh austerity measures which will not foster economic growth and job creation in that Member State.</p>

      <p sl="en">Along with the report on implementation of the excessive deficit procedure, the report on budgetary surveillance in the euro area supplements the economic governance package with several significant requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Stability and Growth Pact provides that correction and observance of the medium-term budgetary objective should be ensured through an obligation to lodge an interest-bearing deposit temporarily imposed on a Member State whose currency is the euro and which is making insufficient progress with budgetary consolidation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The case of Greece shows that falsification of the financial statistics of one state can have disastrous consequences all over the European Union. Therefore, it is vitally necessary to improve both statistical data gathering and verification of the submitted information without delay, and to introduce serious sanctions on the offending Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report on budgetary surveillance in the euro area provides for the imposition of exactly this kind of fine on Member States, namely for falsifying statistics or submitting incorrect information as a result of gross negligence. The fine to be imposed would be up to 0.2% of the GDP of the relevant Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">In spite of my sceptical view of the requirement for the Commission to prepare proposals on the creation of Eurobonds, I consider that approval of the requirements I have referred to would be expedient.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am in favour of significantly strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact in the euro area. It is only possible to ensure that obligations of this kind are fulfilled by effectively enforcing far-reaching sanctions. A deposit or fine of up to 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) is a considerable penalty. The long-term effect of this sanction mechanism will be that those Member States which for years have failed to manage their budgets effectively will have to make use of the bail-out option as a result and this is funded (although at least not exclusively) by money from taxpayers who have complied with the rules. This will understandably be regarded as unfair by the majority of European citizens. Because of one lesson that has so far been learnt from the Stability and Growth Pact, considerable financial penalties will be applied in future if the statistics are manipulated.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The current crisis has proved that the Member States are passively enduring its effects rather than being proactive in finding a way out. As a result, the European Union has decided to implement a package of six proposals aimed at strengthening European economic governance. Thus I am supportive of Europe being more involved and more ambitious in this respect, so that it can anticipate any new crisis. For that to happen, the European Union has decided to put in place a new system that is able to prevent macroeconomic imbalances, especially in terms of trade. Detailed in the Haglund report, this system will introduce a series of measures that will supplement those found in the Ferreira report. In this way, if a Member State has not been able to address its imbalances by following the Council’s recommendations, it will have to gather a deposit and eventually pay a fine, the proceeds of which will be allocated to the European Financial Stability Facility and then to the European Stability Mechanism, which is due to replace it in 2013. Being in favour of enhanced economic surveillance, I voted in favour of the Haglund report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances are an important instrument in addressing the weaknesses that stem, in particular, from medium and long-term structural trends, growing divergence within the EU, and the collateral effects of the policies of different Member States. It is important to extend the scope of surveillance, with a view to avoiding harmful macroeconomic imbalances. The framework for the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances should place emphasis on early detection and prevention of potential imbalances. I voted for this report for the above reasons.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The euro area needs now more than ever the confidence of the financial markets. To achieve this, we need to adopt measures which make Member States keep to the commitments they made through the Stability and Growth Pact. As we have seen from previous experience, Member States have failed to impose budgetary discipline effectively, thereby contributing to the public debt crisis which has had a severe impact on the credibility of the single currency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Reliable statistics are needed to provide effective surveillance and detect macroeconomic imbalances in time. Having the option to impose fines if false macroeconomic data is submitted, especially when the intention is to hide the fact that the targets provided for in the Stability and Growth Pact have been exceeded, will discourage unfair practices.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Just as in the case of the other legislative package reports, a sterling contribution is made to the implementation of the measures for adjusting excessive macroeconomic imbalances by having the option to adopt sanctions by reversed qualified majority and publicising the Council’s deliberations on sanctions. This will help avoid vague agreements between Member States, which result in leniency when imposing sanctions and end up triggering crises like the one we are going through at the moment.</p>

I would, however, have like to see the role of Parliament stepped up under this process, particularly as regards its inclusion in the decision-making process.

      <p sl="pt">The finance ministers of the Member States met on 16 September in Wrocław, Poland, under the Polish Presidency of the Council, to assess a package of six legislative acts, comprising five regulations and a directive, aimed at improving the economic governance of the EU, which has been the focus of intense negotiations between the Council and Parliament, which has tabled 2 000 proposed amendments. This report, drafted by Mr Haglund, is part of this strategy, and looks at implementing measures that are aimed at correcting macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. In April 2011 the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted a set of measures aimed at strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as budgetary surveillance. I also welcome the adoption of this regulation, which, besides avoiding excessive deficit and debt, will enhance the early detection of harmful budgetary deviations and macroeconomic imbalances, so that the competent authorities can take the necessary corrective measures in good time. In addition, the new legislative framework will consider a set of sanctions to discourage failures by the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We believe that this resolution is a positive step in terms of rights based on gender and sexual orientation, and that it counters discrimination. We therefore voted in favour. However, there are some comments that we need to make. Human rights are indeed indivisible. However, the European Union, at the same time as it is taking this positive step, is involved in the process of the accelerated denial and even destruction of social rights, which are human rights, and even economic and political rights. This is happening in countless Member States under the pretext of so-called austerity, but it is particularly prevalent in countries, such as Portugal, which are subject to programmes of veritable aggression from the EU and International Monetary Fund. These attacks affect everyone, including the social groups mentioned most in this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At the same time, several EU countries and the EU itself are involved in operations of intervention and aggression, as in the case of Libya, or of condoning crimes, as in the case of Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people, or, in the past, involvement in acts of profound disrespect for human rights, such as the flights of the US Central Intelligence Agency and secret prisons, which undermine the principles set out in this resolution. In other words, the EU lacks credibility when it talks about ‘universal and indivisible’ human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted against this report, which essentially supports the Commission proposal on the regulation relating to implementing measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. This is another of the key legislative texts of the package on economic governance. It is concerned, above all, with a system of sanctions and the application of fines to any Member State not fulfilling the requirements imposed by the Commission on the basis of the delegated acts. Parliament is seeking its application to any Member State that has notified the Commission that it wishes to apply this regulation, even if it is not a member of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is yet another interventionist measure that calls for the application of the same type of monetarist and neoliberal policies and criteria, tightening the veritable stranglehold imposed on the Member States, without a care for the causes of the problems, or for alternative policies that take into account economies’ different levels of development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What it does is extend the application of sanctions and the payment of fines for any Member State that has not complied with the requirements imposed on it, placing them in a genuinely submissive position with regard to the European institutions, just so as to serve the interests of big business and the financial sector, and this is unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Commission’s proposals to improve economic governance are of great importance to the future of the EU and economic growth, particularly in the euro area. The experience gained during the first decade of the Economic and Monetary Union shows the need for an improved framework for economic governance based on greater responsibility on the part of individual Member States. I am in favour of an extensive reform of the governance framework based on the community method and a strong and independent Commission as overseeing and giving directions in the new deeper and wider economic policy surveillance framework. The framework on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances needs to emphasise early detection and prevention of potentially harmful macroeconomic imbalances. Macroeconomic surveillance cannot be based on a static and simplistic framework. It is crucial to ensure that it is based on thorough economic analysis through in-depth reviews investigating a broad range of economic factors while taking due account of country-specific circumstances. Economic governance and national economic policy should be more a matter of common concern of all parties involved. That is why I believe that there needs to be a closer involvement of national parliaments both at national and at EU level. In addition, Member States should establish national rules and institutions which are in line with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>

At a time when the crisis is hitting the people of Europe hard, the European Parliament cannot send out the austerity message, a message that would be incomprehensible and inexplicable to our fellow citizens, and detrimental to the European project. Furthermore, this report is not ambitious enough. Of course, we must tighten our belts to avoid public deficit, but not to the detriment of social justice and future investment, since these are needed if we are to build a sustainable economy. In other words, we need more Europe if we are to face up to the crisis: a closer fiscal, social and political union and a European budget with own resources.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In June this year, the European Parliament approved a package of measures containing six proposals for creating a better framework for the administration of the EU’s economic affairs, which should lead to greater macroeconomic stability for Member States in the long term. This should be achieved also through the greater involvement of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the procedures for coordinating economic policy. A sophisticated and enforceable system of penalties for the effective correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area should constitute an integral prerequisite for achieving such an ambitious plan, as we also see in the report of Ms Ferreira. The system should be designed in such a way so as to avoid the emergence of asymmetric shocks, contribute to sustainable growth and job creation, and comply with the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Although the final determination of the level of a fine may sometimes be problematic, the levels and method of enforcement should be established on the basis of a sensitive general political consensus.

The EU needs stronger economic surveillance, which should cover all relevant economic areas. Thus, macroeconomic imbalances should be looked at jointly with fiscal policy and growth-enhancing structural reforms. The mechanism for the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances is made up of two sets of draft proposals. The first set of measures is outlined by the proposal for a regulation on the excessive imbalance procedure, which sets out to provide a framework for identifying and addressing macroeconomic imbalances. The second draft proposal focuses on the enforcement of measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances. It is only applicable to euro-area Member States and constitutes an incentive for Member States to address macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage and to ensure appropriate corrective measures where necessary.</p>

The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) can in no way serve as the basis for creating employment policies, because it is based on those very principles that have made jobs disappear. The European Semester cannot be part of the solution to the crisis, because it constitutes a loss of sovereignty for Member States to the benefit of the Commission and its neoliberal dictates. Once again, I voted against.</p>

Indeed, without a significant dissuasion tool, the establishment of the excessive imbalances procedure could come to nothing. Specifically, I welcome the fact that if the alert mechanism signals the presence of excessive imbalances it will trigger the corrective procedure and the Commission can address a warning to the State in question.

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this report on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area, which is part of the legislative package aimed at strengthening economic governance in the EU and the euro area. The Commission proposals for improving economic governance are of the greatest importance for the future of the EU and for economic growth, particularly in the euro area. The crucial importance of these measures meant that Parliament’s rapporteurs decided to examine the Commission proposals exhaustively as a package, and to improve them so as to establish a robust and coherent framework for the coming decades. The rapporteurs have taken the Commission’s proposals as a starting point for their work. This is the first time that Parliament is making a codecision on the macroeconomic development of the Union alongside the Council. I would stress the inclusion in the regulation on macroeconomic imbalances of the Commission’s obligation to assess both countries with a deficit problem and those with a surplus, in order to gain a realistic overview of the European macroeconomic framework.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Integrated economic governance, linking the action of the EU institutions with national authorities as part of a network, is vital in order to correct macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. Given the existence of a shared monetary area, failure on the part of one of the Member States to comply with the common regulatory framework will have repercussions on the situation of all the others, leading to the need for sanctions which ensure that the entire area works properly. Moreover, it is impossible to dispense with a secure basis for decision making, based on reliable data on the situation of the EU economy. This means that there is a need to promote accurate statistics that act as an aid to policy makers.</p>

The Haglund report adopted today by 395 votes to 64, with 201 abstentions coming mainly from the parties on the left, shows the latter’s aversion to discipline and sanctions, because that is what this regulation is about, by seeking to provide solutions to the excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, the European Parliament has wisely decided to include flexible sanctions, should the Member States fail to comply with the recommendations of the Commission and Council on the main economic aggregates that are income, investment, consumption, unemployment and inflation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, I welcome this sweeping reform of the governance framework, based on the Community method, which goes well beyond traditional budgetary surveillance, and which grants more independence to the Commission in monitoring the economic policies of the Member States.

      <p sl="pt">The adoption of this report, included in the ‘six pack’, aims to anticipate, identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances before they become real problems for national economies. It is therefore important to identify the risks, find out whether they are the country’s responsibility or whether they result from external impacts, and make appropriate and timely recommendations. The strengthening of the Commission’s role as watchdog and supervisor of policies relating to the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial to the implementation of genuine European economic governance, as it strengthens the Community method. In addition to the establishment of a smart and balanced system, with the inclusion of more macroeconomic and structural data in the range of statistical indicators, I would stress the new procedure on excessive imbalances, about which the Commission will be able to warn the Member State in advance. If the Member State ignores the warning, the Commission will be able to draft a recommendation for the Council, to the effect that this country should adopt corrective measures, using what is known as reversed qualified majority voting. However, at this point it is more important to take the measures that are needed to prevent future crises than to impose sanctions. The strengthening of the role of the Commission throughout the prevention and surveillance process once again underlines the need to centralise decisions in the Community pillar of the EU.</p>

By adopting these measures aimed at limiting public deficit, the Union is avoiding the devastating knee-jerk reaction of countries turning in on themselves and is showing its determination to come out of the crisis on top; above all we are reminded that sharing a single currency requires maximum solidarity but also shared responsibilities.</p>

This report, for which I voted, sets out detailed rules on the detection of macroeconomic imbalances, as well as the prevention and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the Union. The aim is a warning mechanism to facilitate the early identification and monitoring of imbalances. If the measures taken or provided for in the programme of corrective measures or the relevant schedule for implementation are considered inadequate, the Council adopts, on a recommendation from the Commission, a recommendation for the Member States to submit a new corrective action plan within two months. The Commission’s recommendation on non-compliance is to be considered adopted by the Council unless the Council decides to reject the recommendation by a qualified majority within 10 days of its adoption by the Commission.

      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, coordination of the economic policies of EU Member States, as laid down by the Treaty, should encompass compliance with the main principles, which include stable prices, healthy public finances and currency conditions and a sustainable balance of payments. It is appropriate to supplement the multilateral surveillance referred to in Article 121(3) and (4) of the Treaty with specific rules for the detection, prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances. I agree that this approach will depend on an early warning mechanism which will detect emerging macroeconomic imbalances early on and will be based on the use of a transparent guidance scoreboard, in combination with economic judgment. The procedure for monitoring and correcting unfavourable macroeconomic imbalances with preventative and corrective measures requires stronger control instruments based on the approach employed in the multilateral surveillance procedure.

The Commission and the Council should cooperate closely on drawing up the scoreboard and the set of macroeconomic and macrofinancial indicators for the Member States.

      <p sl="sk">The legislative 'six-pack' adopted by the Commission in September last year to ensure the cohesion of the legislative texts is exceptionally important for the future of the EU and particularly the euro area. Parliament’s intention is to improve the Commission’s proposals to secure a strong and robust framework for the coming decades which will guarantee the compatibility of fiscal discipline with the aims of economic growth and employment in the EU and in all Member States. Only this condition will ensure the stability and sustainability of the EU and the euro. This challenge comes at a particularly difficult time for the EU and the euro area, faced with growth, employment and internal divergences tensions, seriously aggravated by a major international crisis, but this is also the right time to amend, complete and correct the existing model in the light of past and present evidence. This is the first time that Parliament codeciding with the Council on macroeconomic development and fiscal discipline in the EU. Strengthening economic governance must go hand in hand with strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the decisions taken, which requires closer and more timely involvement not just of relevant stakeholders, but in particular of national parliaments and the European Parliament throughout the process in order to achieve sustainable and balanced growth of the European Union as a whole. That is why I am in favour of the extensive reform of the administrative framework based on the community method.</p>

I voted in favour of the report on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances and abstained on the report on the enforcement measures to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Most of the new measures, which follow multiple negotiations conducted in Brussels, merely impose austerity on citizens without taking account of the economic recovery that we need if we are to get back on the path to growth and employment. The Ferreira report was alone in offering persuasive solutions in this area. Indeed, this report provides for the guaranteed protection of social rights and the introduction of a very wide range of economic indicators which allow the situation in each country to be properly taken into account. It also advocates a symmetrical approach, pointing the finger at those Member States with huge trade surpluses as being responsible for developing macroeconomic imbalances. I abstained on the Haglund report, although I do not agree with its punitive content, as it had to be adopted if the measures advocated in the Ferreira report were to be implemented.</p>

At a time when the crisis is severely affecting the people of Europe, the European Parliament cannot send out a message of austerity which citizens will not understand nor be able to explain, and which is detrimental to the European project. Furthermore, this report is not ambitious enough. We must tighten our belts to avoid public deficits, but not to the detriment of social justice and the future investment that is needed if we are to build a sustainable economy. In other words, we need more Europe if we are to face up to the crisis: a more successful fiscal, social and political union and a European budget with own resources.</p>

In this way, it will be possible to address imbalances internal to the euro area. That said, the economic governance package straitjackets Member States into austerity policies.</p>

      <p sl="de">The measures in the ‘six pack’ do not go far enough. We do not currently have a lack of money. We have more money than we know what to do with, but it is in the wrong place. By allowing unregulated casino banks to do business, we have created incentives which have contributed to the fact that around 98% of the money now in circulation throughout the world does not serve a productive or consumptive purpose, but purely a speculative purpose. These destructive ‘financial markets’ – the term is in fact a perversion in itself, because money cannot be a product, instead its value is determined only by its link with an actual value such as a human ability, a product or service – have long since dominated the real, value-added economy and are increasingly holding states in the palm of their hands. This does not mean that we should allow them to dictate to us which measures we must take. Reducing public debt is a sensible and necessary move. Strangling the economy and society without tackling the problem that has been described is not. Otherwise the measures taken will increase the threat rather than counteracting it. Every debt has a corresponding credit and every interest payment has a corresponding interest gain. The unimaginable profits of this irresponsible speculation are being pocketed privately, while the costs are a burden on society. Unlimited debt guarantees are making the spiral of speculation even worse. Without linking risk and liability, without debt reduction, without the realisation of losses made by banks and investors, we will not be able to emerge from the crisis.</p>

This proposal sets out to provide a framework for identifying and addressing macroeconomic imbalances. The proposal should be analysed together with the Regulation on enforcement measures to correct macroeconomic imbalances. The two acts a fully-fledged mechanism on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances. The EU needs stronger economic surveillance, which should cover all relevant economic areas. Thus, macroeconomic imbalances should be looked at jointly with fiscal policy and growth-enhancing structural reforms. It is possible to identify a trend characterised, on the one hand, by the broadening of economic surveillance beyond budgetary surveillance in order to prevent excessive macroeconomic imbalances and, on the other hand, by the deepening of fiscal surveillance. This procedure should put in place an alert mechanism for the early detection of emerging macroeconomic imbalances. It should be based on the use of an indicative and transparent scoreboard, comprising indicative thresholds combined with economic judgment. This evaluation should take into account, inter alia, nominal and real convergence in the euro area and beyond.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances will certainly serve to strengthen economic governance in the European Union and the euro area, as this has been adversely affected by the financial crisis which is engulfing Europe. Improving the mechanisms for monitoring the situation and the means for enforcing corrective measures to imbalances which do occur will be effective in preventing the occurrence of divergences between the positions of the Member States. A very important role in this matter should be played by indicators for the early detection of such imbalances, which will give effective warning and allow more time for essential corrective action. On the other hand, however, it is necessary to call particular attention to the fact that the instruments which are used – which include among others the excessive deficit procedure and annual fines – should not adversely affect relations and public attitudes in the Member States to the question of closer European integration.</p>

Requiring Member States to address their macroeconomic imbalances is not about imposing measures that hurt countries or their citizens or punishing those already under a lot of pressure.

This draft opinion is on the proposal, tabled by the Commission, for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the ‘strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies’. It is generally agreed that the SGP has failed in terms of both prevention and correction, and needs to be reformed. I agree with the amendments to the proposal initially tabled by the Commission, which were adopted in Parliament by a broad majority.

I therefore voted in favour of the report by Mr Feio, because it is high time that Member States faced up to their responsibilities. The European Union, as part of the ‘economic governance package’, is now calling on Member States to correct their excessive deficits quickly. In order to do so, the Union, in the aforementioned report, has laid out a detailed procedure to be followed. This procedure will afford the European Union enhanced rights in examining a Member State’s deficit and debt. The aim of this is to get a Member State’s finances back on track more quickly. The European Commission will now be able to act much more quickly and exert greater pressure by increasing the number of in situ visits it makes. It will be possible to impose a fine on any Member State that does not meet its commitments, and the sum levied will go to the European Financial Stability Facility and then the European Stability Mechanism which is due to replace it in 2013.</p>

The aim of the excessive deficit procedure is to prevent excessive budget deficits, and, if these occur, to correct them swiftly, in which case compliance with budgetary discipline is assessed on the basis of the budget deficit and public debt criteria. In order to strengthen dialogue between the EU institutions, particularly Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and to ensure greater transparency and accountability, the relevant parliamentary committee may invite the President of the Council, the Commission and, where appropriate, the President of the European Council or of the Euro Group to appear before the committee to discuss the Council’s decision.

      <p sl="cs">The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound public finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth underpinned by financial stability and conducive to employment creation. In my opinion, the rules on budgetary discipline should be strengthened in particular by giving a more prominent role to the level and evolution of debt and overall sustainability. Establishment of the existence of an excessive deficit based on the deficit criterion and the steps leading to it should not, in my opinion, focus exclusively on non-compliance with the recommended numerical values, but should always take into account all the key factors covered by the Commission report under Article 126(3) of the Treaty. The Commission report under Article 126(3) of the Treaty should give appropriate consideration to the quality of the national fiscal framework, as it plays a crucial role in supporting fiscal consolidation and sustainable public finances. In order to support the monitoring of compliance with Council recommendations and notices for the correction of situations of excessive deficit, there is, in my view, a need that these specify annual budgetary targets consistent with the required fiscal improvement in cyclically adjusted terms, net of one-offs and other temporary measures.</p>

I would stress that, with the adoption of this document, the Commission will now have coordination and supervision responsibilities, taking a more active role in assessing and monitoring the performance of each Member State. This is an important step towards restructuring, strengthening and greater dynamism in Europe’s stability and growth policies.

The current process of strengthening economic governance must go hand in hand with reinforcing the democratic legitimacy of the decisions made, which requires the direct involvement not only of the relevant stakeholders, but also of national parliaments and the European Parliament throughout the process. The experience acquired during the first decade of the Economic and Monetary Union’s operation has highlighted the definite need for a better economic governance framework, which should be based on a stronger commitment at national level to the regulations and policies agreed by common consent and on a more robust system for monitoring national economic policies at EU level.</p>

The global economic and financial crisis, which is taking so long to show signs of easing, has shown the need for better EU coordination and improved surveillance of the economic policies of the Economic and Monetary Union. The situations that have attracted the attention of economists and politicians include the monitoring of excessive deficits and the macroeconomic imbalances of the Member States. The dilemma that we are debating is this: how can we monitor excessive deficits and ensure economic growth? The new legislative package has an answer to this question: much stronger surveillance in the Stability and Growth Pact, and increased accountability and transparency are needed so that we can have sustainable public finances in the Member States.

      <p sl="pt">However, because this is not easy to do, at least with the public’s consent, it seeks to strengthen the directorate that determines the fate of the EU, concentrating ever more economic and political power upon it, taking decision making away from the public and the structures closest to and controlled by them. It tightens the stranglehold on the Member States even more, in particular on the countries with the weakest economies, and on their people. These new rules strengthen the surveillance role of the Commission, increasing its interference in economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policy, in the name of avoiding excessive budgetary deficits and debt, and enabling penalties to be applied to the most vulnerable Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">These new rules strengthen the surveillance role of the Commission and its interference in economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policy, in the name of preventing excessive budgetary deficits and debt, enabling the application of penalties to the most vulnerable Member States and of new indicators to detect supposed macroeconomic imbalances.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Coordination of the economic policies of the countries of the European Union as set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should denote observance of the main principles aimed at stable prices, sound public finances and monetary conditions, and a sustainable balance of payments. The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and strong sustainable growth underpinned by financial stability and conducive to creating employment. The common framework for the administration of economic governance must be improved in line with the high degree of integration between Member State economies within the European Union, and particularly in the euro area. The rules on financial discipline need to be strengthened. Implementing the existing excessive deficit procedure on the basis of both the deficit criterion and the debt criterion requires a numerical benchmark that takes into account the business cycle against which to assess whether the ratio of government debt to GDP is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace. References contained Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 should take account of the new Article numbering of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the replacement of Council Regulation (EC) No 3625/93 by Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 of 25 May 2009 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community.

All the measures are intended to ‘regain the confidence of the markets’. At the same time, we are gambling away something much more important: the confidence of the citizens, whose money we are pouring into a bottomless pit, while constantly making new promises, whom we are bleeding dry to allow multinational speculators to make exorbitant profits and whom we regularly pass over in the course of making all of these decisions. Behind the backs of the citizens and without a fundamental, open public debate, we are making major changes in course which will have dramatic consequences for decades to come for every individual person.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because the regulation is meant to avoid gross error in budgetary policies, which could put at risk the sustainability of public finances. This translates into an obligation for Member States to avoid excessive government deficits, which are established according two main criteria: deficit and debt. The excessive deficit procedure (EDP), which implements a ban on excessive deficits, provides a sequence of steps to be followed. This system is backed by an enforcement mechanism involving financial sanctions for non-compliance with the provisions set out by the regulation. A reform of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact is necessary as a response to a number of shortcomings highlighted by the economic and financial crisis. Consequently, the proposal focuses on the following measures: making the debt criteria of the EDP operational - this measure comes as a response to the marginal role hitherto played by debt, although the two criteria (deficit and debt) are in principle on an equal footing; the introduction of a new set of financial sanctions for euro-area Member States in order to deter excessive general deficits and, if they occur, to encourage their prompt correction; and a clearer and a more flexible framework for the Commission to submit possible recommendations. It follows that the main purpose of this proposal is to deter and correct excessive deficits, to avoid gross error in budgetary policies and to set out the detailed rules to be followed when applying the excessive deficit procedure.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The budgetary discipline of the different Member States is a prerequisite for the balance of the EU as a whole. In this context, it is well known that effective monitoring is better than severe penalties. The concern with ensuring that excessive deficit procedures are applied swiftly is therefore justified. However, any change to the regulatory framework cannot ignore the current situation nor the need to ensure that the Member States have a transition period that allows them to adapt to the limits set out in EU law.</p>

      <p sl="en">The ECR has always supported the eurozone’s efforts to find a way out of the crisis and to ensure that it does not happen again. It is regrettable, however, that the chosen way of doing so requires that the whole of the EU, and not just the eurozone, must be subject to the new and intrusive powers that have been handed to the Commission through the economic governance package. The ECR cooperated fully to make the new system as effective, accountable and transparent as possible and to reduce its impact on the Member States outside the eurozone. It is a shame that governmental profligacy and contempt for the Stability and Growth Pact has required such a system to be put in place, and we hope that all Member States have now learnt that fiscal prudence is essential at all times, and not just when times are bad. Even though we have not been able to support this report, we hope that Parliament’s vote will go some way towards restoring the faith of the markets that proper action is being taken.

      <p sl="pt">The economic governance legislative package should be affirmed as a fundamental instrument of the European Union for preventing future crises and promoting economic competitiveness. A proper regulatory framework is necessary to achieve key objectives such as European economic recovery and the consolidation of the internal market, the sustainability of pension systems, and structural reforms which stimulate employment and ensure the flexibility and security of the labour market. In this context, speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure is crucial to measuring and controlling the dynamics of debt in the euro area, and the existing rules should also be revised in order to prevent the worsening of current situations, as well as to allow for a clearer and more flexible framework for future recommendations by the Commission. European economic governance with a stronger Community method should be of common concern to all the Member States. In order for this European governance to be successful, the Member States and their national parliaments need take more responsibility, and national reform programmes should contribute to an integrated approach that is aimed at growth and the creation of employment. I voted for the report for those reasons.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted against the report on the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure because the economic governance package only introduces austerity measures and does not give Member States the chance to invest in economic growth and job creation measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The aim of the excessive budget deficit procedure is to prevent excessive public deficits and boost their correction. Compliance with budgetary discipline is examined on the basis of the public deficit and public debt criteria. The Council decides whether there is an excessive deficit within two months and makes recommendations to the relevant Member State. The Council recommendation sets a deadline of six months for the relevant Member State to take specific action and a deadline for correcting the excessive deficit, which must be achieved within the year after it was identified. The Council requests the Member State to achieve annual budgetary targets which allow a deficit reduction of at least 0.5% of GDP as a benchmark, in order to ensure the correction of the excessive deficit within the deadline set in the recommendation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that these austerity measures limit the flexibility of Member States to devise their own set of measures to provide economic and social development and, by extension, help reduce the excessive deficit in the medium and long term.</p>

      <p sl="lv">An improved system of economic governance in the EU must be based on mutually coordinated policy approaches aimed at sustainable growth and improved employment, and based on the guiding principles of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Special attention must be drawn to both developing the internal market and fostering international trade and competitiveness, as well as to effective regulation of national budgetary positions, prevention of macroeconomic fluctuations, and more effective supervision and regulation of the financial market.</p>
      <p sl="lv">In order to achieve this, we must, first of all, approve certain requirements to be imposed on national budgets along with sanctions in the event of persistent non-compliance with these requirements. The report provides that where there is judged to be an inappropriate budgetary framework or an excessive budget deficit, the Member State will have imposed on it certain requirements that must be fulfilled within a deadline of six months. In a particularly serious situation, the Member State may be required to act within three months in order to reduce its budget deficit within a year.</p>
      <p sl="lv">In order to provide the necessary discipline among the euro-area Member States, agreement has been reached on an enhanced surveillance role for the Commission, which will henceforth not only carry out an assessment of the economic situation in Member States but also undertake special surveillance missions in those Member States, accompanied by the European Central Bank where necessary.</p>

In evaluating a Member State’s compliance with the deficit and debt position criteria, the implementation of pension reforms will also be considered in the light of future challenges, as an anticipatory measure.

It advocates the need for the Member States to create accounting systems that cover all government sectors in a full and consistent way, and it adds that the Member States should ensure that their budget plan is based on realistic macroeconomic and budgetary assumptions, and that they use the most up-to-date information to determine whether this is the case. All government bodies and funds not forming part of the ordinary budgets at sub-sector level should be identified and submitted, along with other relevant information, as part of the annual budgetary procedure. Budgetary planning should be based on the most likely macro-fiscal scenario or on a more prudent scenario.

      <p sl="sk">We need to draw on the experience of the first decade of the Economic and Monetary Union. Recent economic developments have posed new challenges to the conduct of fiscal policy across the Union and have in particular highlighted the need for uniform requirements as regards the rules and procedures for establishing the budgetary frameworks of the Member States. Member State governments and government sub-sectors maintain accounting systems which include elements such as bookkeeping, internal control, financial reporting and audits. These should be distinguished from statistical data which relate to the results of public finances based on statistical methodologies, and from forecasts or budgeting actions which relate to future public finances. Complete and reliable public accounting practices for all sectors of general government are a precondition for the production of high quality statistics that are comparable across Member States. The availability of fiscal data is crucial to the proper functioning of the budgetary surveillance framework of the Union. Regular availability of timely and reliable fiscal data is the key to proper and well-timed monitoring. In my view a fundamental element in ensuring the quality of these data is transparency, which should incorporate their regular availability.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Despite having abstained from voting on some of the reports of the so-called ‘economic governance package’, I believe that this body of legislation represents notable progress in the integration of the budgetary policies and economic policies of the Member States, with the aim of strengthening budgetary discipline and reducing macroeconomic imbalances and asymmetries in competitiveness, which are conditions for the stability of the euro, economic recovery and the external competitiveness of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This legislative package corrects some of the key weaknesses which have long been identified in the structure of the euro and the monetary union. If this new system had been established at the beginning of the monetary union, it is very likely that the EU would have resisted the 2008 banking crisis and the subsequent economic crisis differently, and could have been spared the current public debt crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If we could not prevent the crisis, at least let us draw lessons from it in order to prevent other crises in the future. Moreover, the adoption of this legislative package sends a strong message of confidence to the financial markets and economic agents as regards guarantees of the stability of the euro. The adoption of this comprehensive reform is therefore to be welcomed.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Economic governance, as the adoption of political measures aimed at achieving certain practical results, is only able to meet its objectives using reliable data on the situation of the Member States. That is, the less reliable the data, the less certain the success or failure of economic intervention in the Member States. Transparent and reliable macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts from the Member States are thus a precondition for the success of economic governance measures.

      <p sl="en">Abstention. The Commission’s legislative package released last September has in this perspective the explicit aim of strengthening surveillance of economic policies and ensuring effective compliance with fiscal consolidation on the one hand, as well as taking proper account of macrofinancial imbalances such as excessive levels of private debt or weakness of internal demand on the other hand. These macrofinancial imbalances have been largely ignored in the framework of the current Stability and Growth Pact, which solely focuses on public deficits and public debt ratios. Although the report as it stands increases transparency and accountability of the budgetary process at the Member State level, still many question marks remain on how Member States are going to interpret it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am delighted at the adoption, this lunchtime, of the report on the economic governance package, now referred to, in European jargon, as the ‘six pack’. It represents a decisive vote and a move towards European economic governance and also a more federal Europe. However, this package of measures will not save the euro from its current difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These structural measures do, nonetheless, draw lessons from the current crisis and from the laxity of budgetary policies over the last 20 years. The Ford report on the strengthening of the Member States’ budgetary frameworks helps to put things back on an even keel and draws lessons, in particular, from the case of Greece.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In essence, it consists in imposing more demanding and more binding rules on Member States when they draft their national budgets. It also requires national statistical institutes to be independent, and provides for penalties in the event of there being any falsification of the figures submitted to the European institutions. This is an urgent requirement, given that we now know the extent to which Greece falsified its statistics when it was joining the euro area in 2001.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted against the report on the proposal for a directive on the requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States because the whole economic governance package only introduces austerity measures and does not give Member States the chance to invest in economic growth and job creation measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To ensure the smooth operation of the EU’s budget surveillance framework, it is important to have available publicly the fiscal data, official macroeconomic and budget forecasts, as well as the methodologies, assumptions and parameters on which these forecasts are based. Other requirements include adopting the international public sector accounting standards and the professional independence of the national statistics authorities and national courts of auditors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is important that the methodologies, assumptions and parameters which underpin the Commission’s macroeconomic and budget forecasts are made public, and that the level of Member States’ debts and deficits, along with their progress, is published at least every quarter by Eurostat. However, I think that the Commission’s role is to coordinate Member States’ macroeconomic and budgetary policies so that they comply with the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission may, using the tools it has available, make improvements to the national statistics authorities’ operation, but must not replace them.</p>

This directive will ensure that there is greater transparency and a clearer identification of national accounting systems, and that these will be subject to independent audits. What is more, national budget forecasts will be monitored and regularly compared with Eurostat budgetary forecasts and, in the event of significant disparities, Member States will be called upon to provide convincing explanations. Some lament the loss of sovereignty that follows from the adoption of this text, but on this score, the bankruptcy of Member States is likely to cause considerably more harm than the efforts that we have just made towards convergence and transparency.

I welcome today’s adoption of the regulation establishing a system for detecting and correcting macroeconomic imbalances. It contains important measures protecting social rights, ensuring that a wide range of potential economic imbalances will be monitored. There is a clear alternative to brute austerity. We need a broader and more ambitious agenda for the euro zone. We need an alternative economic governance scheme that includes: 1. A European Growth and Jobs Pact to promote investment, recovery, growth and jobs as well as restoring public finances. 2. Stronger and more democratic decision-making arrangements, so that Europe can respond promptly and effectively. 3. A strong system of eurobonds to stabilise markets and lower interest rates. 4. A tax on financial transactions, to raise new revenue and limit harmful forms of speculation 5. A larger European budget to support European-wide policies and financed through own resources.</p>

Austerity measures which do not safeguard investments and which suppress demand will result in growth being blocked and jobs being lost. They will make economic recovery impossible and this is the requirement for a return to a balanced budget. The package is unbalanced from a social perspective. It gives in to pressure from the financial markets and leaves the citizens to bear the costs of the crisis. There is a lack of democratic control over the most important decisions made on economic policy. During months of negotiations, our group struggled to achieve a compromise, but the Conservative majority in the Council and in Parliament refused to budge an inch from its inflexible austerity policy, even when it became ever clearer that this approach was constantly pushing Europe further towards a double-dip recession. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has highlighted a clear alternative which is described in detail in the paper entitled ‘A fair way out of the crisis’ (http://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/gpes/media3/documents/3574_DE_fair_way_out_crisis_de_100908.pdf).</p>

      <p sl="de">Tightening up the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact will iron out the worst of the nonsense by ‘automating’ the deficit procedure. The offenders, in this case the Member States in the Council which are in debt, will no longer sit in judgment over other offenders. However, this reform does not provide a solution for the current debt crisis in Greece and Portugal. Neither country is in the position to make use of the reform and, therefore, both have become insolvent. The Stability and Growth Pact will not prevent the European Union from becoming a transfer union in future. In the case of asymmetric shocks, the necessary variation in exchange rates is the only criterion which should be used as the basis for forming a monetary union. Otherwise a fiscal transfer union is needed. As a result, only the division of the monetary area into a hard and a soft monetary union will be able to prevent the formation of a transfer union which does not have democratic legitimacy. The effects of the political ideals and daydreams that form part of these centralistic measures can be seen in the disturbances in the southern Member States.</p>

In the worst case, competitiveness will be punished because current account surpluses are ‘too high’. In the positive scenarios, the proposals for restraining wage increases that arise as a result of the distortion of incentives in a badly constructed monetary area will fall flat.

      <p sl="fi">The EU’s current Stability and Growth Pact, if complied with, would have sufficed very well, and would still do so. I do not believe the situation will improve by evolving new rules, while the previous ones have been ignored. The ‘six pack’ is associated with a penalty mechanism, to make obeying the rules a more attractive option in the future. If a penalty is imposed, it will make the position of the country in crisis even worse. If it is not, the section on penalties will become a dead letter.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Even if these new rules were to have a phenomenal impact, they come too late. The ‘six pack’ speaks about the prevention of over-indebtedness at an early stage, but the ‘prevention’ of the crises in the countries concerned is already years too late. The other Member States appreciate, from the examples that they have witnessed, just what sort of threat this is, and are doing all they can to avoid bankruptcy, without any increase in the EU’s powers. These rules will not help avert the present crisis, because it is already at its worst.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The ‘six pack’ is a major step towards an EU Federation. The image that Finland might now be overseeing and controlling Greece, for example, is the wrong one. In reality, the European Commission will be controlling Finland and the other Member States. We will not acquire more rights: on the contrary, we will have new responsibilities. Finland’s subservience to the EU will be made official, even in economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The centralisation of control and new powers in the Commission is the worst thing that can happen for democracy. The European Parliament too will have to watch the situation, mainly during the processes that determine the ‘six pack’, and discuss it with the Commission and the Council.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because the European Union and its Member States should guarantee respect for human rights in their own policies, and the European Union’s position in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHCR) should be stronger and more sustainable. Although we are living in a period of democracy and are making every effort to defend fundamental human rights and freedoms, the many human rights abuses and widespread gender-based discrimination both within the European Union and in third countries continue to cause concern. Thus, this resolution adopted by the UNHCR is important for ensuring compliance with and implementation of international human rights standards in order to prevent people from being discriminated against. Furthermore, we should focus on the fact that respect for and the promotion and safeguarding of the universality of human rights is part of the European Union’s ethical and legal acquis . It is important for the Member States to cooperate more closely with third countries by participating in Universal Periodic Review and the procedures of Treaty-monitoring bodies to ensure the consistency of the European Union’s external and internal actions in the field of human rights, as provided for by the Treaty on European Union. Furthermore, the Member States and the Commission should together fully address these issues of inequality.</p>

Respect for, and the promotion and safeguarding of, the universality of human rights is fundamental to the European Union’s ethical and legal acquis .

There is continuing concern regarding the numerous human rights violations and widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, both in the European Union and in third countries. The European Union and its Member States should guarantee respect for human rights in their own policies and practice. Moreover, the Commission should produce a comprehensive road map against homophobia and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. Indeed the High Representative, the Commission and Member States should further promote, in partnership with third countries, human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity through bilateral human rights dialogues, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) and other external financial instruments.</p>

The defence of human rights has been one of the main flagship policies of the EU throughout its history. Despite having signed up to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, there are Member States in which these principles are violated on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

      <p sl="pt">In 1947, the United Nations (UN) established the ‘two states’ principle for the territory of the former Palestine. The State of Israel was established and recognised as a member of the UN. The Palestinian people have been waiting 64 years for the realisation of their legitimate and inalienable right to independent statehood. This principle has been reaffirmed in several UN resolutions over the years. The request made to the UN General Assembly by the President of the Palestinian National Authority for the recognition of the State of Palestine, sovereign and viable, with its pre-1967 borders, including East Jerusalem, as a full member of the UN, is the logical conclusion of all those resolutions and principles in the UN Charter. However, the reality in the territory is the consolidation and advancement of Israeli occupation, supported by successive US administrations, with the connivance of the EU. In doing so, it submits the Palestinian people to various forms of violence and oppression. At a time when justice, clarity and unconditional support for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people are being called for, this resolution is ambiguous, as it shields the continued imposition of constraints that favour the continuance of the situation that has existed here for decades. We therefore did not vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Human rights are indeed indivisible, but what is happening is that the European Union is not fulfilling this precept, as while it is taking positive steps in terms of rights based on gender and sexual orientation, it is involved in an accelerated process of denying and even destroying social rights – which are human rights – as well as economic and political rights. These attacks affect everyone, including the social groups given the greatest mention in this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At the same time, several EU countries and the EU itself are involved in operations of intervention and aggression, as in the case of Libya, or of condoning crimes, as in the case of Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people, or, in the past, involvement in acts of profound disrespect for human rights, such as the US Central Intelligence Agency’s flights and secret prisons, which undermine the principles set out in this resolution. In other words, the EU lacks credibility when it talks about ‘universal and indivisible’ human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although we voted for this motion for a resolution, we therefore reject the idea, in the name of human rights, that there should be any tactics of intervention or even aggression now or in the future, as these themselves are gross violations of human rights and international law itself.</p>

The EU and its Member States should guarantee human rights in their own policies and procedures in order to strengthen the EU’s position and its credibility in the UNCHR. The EU attaches a great deal of importance to universal and inviolable human rights and has included the issues of sexual orientation and gender identity as part of its activities in the UN, in regional bodies and in some of its bilateral dialogues on human rights. Despite this, a number of the contracting bodies of the UN monitoring human rights, special rapporteurs and agencies, as well as the general secretary of the UN and the UN High Commissioner for human rights have expressed major concern at the human rights violations that lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals all over the world encounter.

On 17 June 2011, the UN Human Rights Council reaffirmed the universality of this Declaration by adopting a first resolution on ‘Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity’. This resolution is a significant step for safeguarding the rights of the LGBT community, for it acknowledges human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity; it calls for better protection of the rights of this community, and it recognises the legitimacy of human rights defenders working on these issues. While I welcome this positive development in the UN, I remain alert to the ongoing human rights violations, based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which still take place in many countries around the world. The fact that 21 EU members co-sponsored this resolution sends a powerful message to our citizens, our colleagues and partners overseas.

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the resolution on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity at the United Nations. I would like to stress the need for the Member States to act on the findings of reports published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, and in particular the findings contained in its report of November 2010 entitled ‘Homophobia, transphobia and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity’. In relation to this, I also call on the European Commission to draw up and introduce an EU instrument to tackle abuse and violence caused by hatred of LGBT people and motivated by prejudice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also support the call expressed in the resolution for the active promotion of human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity in partnership with third countries. Bilateral human rights dialogues and use of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights are important in this respect. It is essential that the issues of sexual orientation and gender identity be a permanent part of the work of the Human Rights Council and of other UN bodies. This subject should be discussed at the 19th session of the Human Rights Council in 2012.</p>

      <p sl="en">On 28 September 2011, the European Parliament adopted by a very large majority (442 votes in favour; 104 against) a resolution on human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The issue of the need to fight against discrimination in this area is of universal significance, both in the framework of EU foreign policy and within the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The resolution reaffirms the fundamental rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, including the right to a family life. Moreover, the resolution text was strengthened in plenary by the adoption of joint amendments from various left-wing political groups, and even amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, which called for the depsychiatrisation of the transsexual and transgender journey, free choice of care providers, simplification of the process of changing identity, and for costs to be met by social security schemes.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It seems to have become the rule that major issues such as the basic values of the EU in the UN are slipped on to the agenda of the parliamentary part-sessions at the last moment. The draft motion for a resolution demanding the unconditional transposition of so-called 'new' human rights, which sexual orientation and gender identity are deemed to be, into all aspects of EU foreign policy has only been available in one language. Only one spokesman from each political group has been able to speak on the matter. This makes it hard to shake off a sense that someone is trying to obstruct legitimate debate on these issues. That is a pity. It also angers me that any expression of doubt as to whether pigeon-holing groups of people in society at large on the basis of their sexual orientation or identity is the right way to go is automatically pilloried as homophobia, transphobia or discrimination. Human rights policy should be inclusive. That is why I voted against the tabled resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, thank you for including this item in today’s proceedings. This debate is about fundamental issues. It is about European solidarity and the current state of European solidarity; it is about the responsibility of Europe – which means our own responsibility – for those who are weak, poor and excluded, often through no fault of their own.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am grateful to you all for the opportunity of telling you about the progress of work on this important dossier. I know that in March 2009 the European Parliament adopted the Siekierski report by a clear majority, and recently, in July 2011, it called for a solution to be found quickly so that the food programme can be continued in the remaining years of the funding period. Testimony to the importance of this programme for our citizens is seen in the fact that free EU food aid is being provided to 18 million people – and not just to people who are unemployed, homeless, migrants, elderly or socially underprivileged or to people who in different ways have fallen victim to circumstances, but also to families with many children and people who are bringing up children on their own. As you know, over 80 million people are at risk of poverty in the European Union, including 20 million children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I know that thousands of local charities are involved in running the programme, and that there are hundreds – thousands – of volunteers who distribute the food to the poor. This is usually done by young people, and in this way they are learning to help others. For over 20 years, the programme has not only contributed to achievement of the objectives of the common agricultural policy, but has also contributed to the cultivation of civil society and to social development. We can also say that the programme is helping achieve the strategic objectives of Europe 2020. Millions of citizens and many charitable organisations are waiting to hear good news from Strasbourg and Brussels. There are undoubtedly many who are listening to this debate today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The current programme enables the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations, which distribute it among the most deprived people in the European Union. In recent years, the common agricultural policy has undergone a fundamental change. Intervention purchases as a tool for regulating the market have been completely withdrawn in the case of certain products or have been significantly reduced. As a consequence, the food aid programme’s dependence on purchases from the market has significantly increased in this time. Although work is still being carried out under the programme, the funding made available to it for next year has been significantly reduced. The fear exists that in 2013 this funding will be further reduced or even that nothing will be made available at all.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like, here, to emphasise very strongly that the Presidency aims to forge a compromise which will make it possible to continue the programme in full. In Council the majority of Member States support the programme, but there is a minority which is blocking it. The countries which are against the programme argue their position in different ways. Most of them say that the programme supports the objectives of social policy and that this is the responsibility of the Member States, so in their opinion the European Union should not support poor people from the EU budget. I am afraid I find it hard to agree with such an approach. I do not want to criticise those Member States, because that is not the role of the Presidency. The word ‘solidarity’ in this case means help for those who are most in need. Let us remember that participation in the programme is voluntary. As the Commission says, there are no budget-related or legal objections to maintaining the programme. We have a sum of EUR 500 million reserved for the programme in the EU budget every year. The costs of running the programme are barely EUR 1 per citizen per year. Commissioner Cioloş has explained repeatedly that the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 13 April 2011 is not an obstacle to making a political decision. Five months after the judgment, the Commission has put forward an amended proposal in order to amend the contested legislation. Adoption of this proposal in its current or in a slightly modified form will solve the problem of the legality of making purchases from the market. Therefore, everything is in the hands of the Council and Parliament. The opponents of the programme have no grounds for using legal or technical matters as excuses. We need to say frankly that responsibility for the future of the programme lies on their shoulders. They must not react to this matter by burying their heads in the sand.</p>
      <p sl="pl">By restricting or ending the programme we will not reduce poverty – poverty will hit at the Europe we live in with double force. We should not be embarrassed about poverty – we should work actively to reduce it. As you know, the Commission has proposed that in the new Multiannual Financial Framework the funding of food aid should be moved from Heading 2 to Heading 1. In the opinion of the Commission, the principles of the programme mean that under Heading 1, in fact, it fits in better with the Europe 2020 strategy. At the right moment the Commission will put forward a new legislative proposal for the period beginning from 2014. Let us hope that the programme will then enjoy the support of all the Member States. Of course, the programme will not solve the problem of poverty, but it can contribute to its reduction. Even in the wealthiest of the EU’s Member States there are people in need, people who are going through problems. It is not just people from urban areas who are affected by poverty, but chiefly people who live in small towns or sparsely-populated rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The continuing economic crisis and rising unemployment mean that the number of people who cannot meet their basic needs is growing – they should be given help, and they must be given help by the European Union. For precisely this reason we have included the programme in the agenda for the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in September. The last debate in the forum of the Council was, at the request of the Polish Presidency, a public debate. Every citizen had the opportunity to follow it on the Internet. Unfortunately, for three years we have had an impasse in the Council over solutions to this problem. It is a pity that at a time of crisis, when the number of those in need of food is rising, social sensitivity and plain European solidarity is waning among some politicians.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The matter of the programme for food distribution to the most needy will probably be discussed in October at the Council of EU Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Ministers. Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to assure you that the Presidency is doing everything it can to find a solution as part of current bilateral contacts with the governments of the Member States which are opposed to the proposal, both among Ministers for Agriculture and among Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I know that some delegations are wondering whether a decision on this matter should not be made by the European Council on 17-18 October. In the next few days, I am going to send a letter about this to the President, Mr Van Rompuy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Presidency is fully aware that the Commission’s proposals enjoy the clear support of many Members of this House. Such support is also being declared by many of the Member States. I can only assure the House that we will make every effort to break the current deadlock and work out an agreed position in Council as soon as possible. Five previous presidencies have not been able to make progress and break the blocking minority, but I continue to believe that it will be possible to do this under my leadership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to thank the House for supporting the programme, but would also like to ask you all for help in convincing the national governments and parliaments which oppose giving European Union food aid to the poorest people in the EU. I am very much counting on your help.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The programme is confirmation that the European Union feels responsible for its most deprived citizens and that it promotes ideals of solidarity. Millions of the European Union’s citizens know that when they go through hard times the Union does not forget them. They can count on the help of Brussels and Strasbourg. It is inconceivable to me that the programme will not be continued in the future. It is not only the European Union and the EU institutions which would lose face, because we would all bring shame on ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, the subject we are debating today – the food aid programme for the most deprived – is an extremely important issue and of great topical relevance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we are all aware, following the serious economic crisis, the number of EU citizens who need these programmes in order to be fed has increased dramatically. The long queues that form outside charity organisations speak for themselves. Indeed, over the past 25 years we have had a programme that has proved its worth by supporting those organisations. A total of 440 000 tonnes of food a year is distributed to them, which constitutes more than half of what the food banks provide to the most deprived people in the Member States. Eighteen million people await our decision. An average of 18 million people benefit from this programme every year. Even though this programme exists and works properly, some want to see it disappear right at a time when we may need it more than ever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall be clear on this point. The legal and financial issues that have arisen in order for the programme to continue can be resolved for 2012 and 2013. What is lacking is the political will on the part of a few. I would like to be clear on that point, as well: nobody can hide behind a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court of Justice ruling does not challenge the advisability of this programme. Rather, it challenges the legal basis, which needs to be updated, and it is precisely the role of the political institutions to decide on the amendments that should be made to that legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From that perspective, the European Commission has made a clear choice, because, within its proposals for the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period following 2013, it has offered to include these programmes in its economic and social cohesion policy, with a budget of EUR 2.5 million for the period 2014-2020. The aim of this is to ensure these programmes continue. For 2012 and 2013, a period that is currently under threat and needs urgent attention, the Commission’s proposal – which the Council has been debating since 2008 and which I amended in September 2010 in order to take your comments into account – would allow us to bridge the gap between current regulations, which limit purchases to intervention stocks, and 2014, after which we will also have a new legal basis within the framework of social cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Sawicki said, I have already warned the Council that, if it does not take this decision immediately, given that Parliament has already expressed its view, the 2012 plan will only constitute one quarter of that of past years. For 2013 there would be no plan at all, because it is unlikely that we would have significant intervention on the market so as to make public stocks available. If there is no amendment to the current regulation by means of the political decision that the Council needs to take, we run the risk of not being able to allocate a single euro to the 2013 programme, even though the budget exists.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank you today for the continued support you have shown on this issue, and particularly for recently adopting the resolution of 7 July 2011, which stresses the need to find an agreement enabling this programme to continue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also aware that many of you have spoken out in favour of the continued full financing of these programmes by the EU budget. In that respect, I have shown considerable flexibility as regards the conditions required in order for all interested Member States to be able to take part. I have also shown the Council that I am ready to be flexible if the Council can manage to find a majority in order to take this decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I took note of the discussion that took place in the Council on 20 September 2011; the Commission is currently looking at solutions to try to end this deadlock, and potentially to propose a shared legal basis for the common agricultural policy (CAP) and social policies so that it will be available for 2012 and 2013. I hope to be able to find a solution to this political issue in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am counting on your active support in order to reach a swift agreement, because I think this is another opportunity to show that Europe does not just mean Brussels and Strasbourg, but rather that Europe is active in the field, and this scheme is a perfect example of a programme that works in the field. It is my belief that we should not be afraid to take political responsibility for this Europe that takes action in the field. We believe that this ideal should be put into practice on a daily basis, and I am certain that you will remain faithful to that ideal and to that principle of carrying out specific actions in the field and thereby show our citizens that Europe takes action in that way and shows solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as a result of the crisis, which has now lasted for an exceptionally long time, conditions affecting the lives of Europe’s citizens have clearly deteriorated: unemployment is rising, many employees are receiving lower pay, retail prices of food are constantly going up and the scale of poverty is growing. Pensioners with less money are saving on food to be able to buy medicines. Many of them, just like many unemployed people, benefit from the free distribution of food.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Europe we now have around 80 million people living below or on the poverty line. What are we to say to the people who ask us why the Union is making cuts in spending on the free distribution of food in this situation? As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, intervention buying is being progressively reduced. Does the falling number and amount of products being held in intervention stocks mean we have to cut back on the provision of free food to those who do not have enough to eat?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Not long ago, we discussed this issue here in plenary. Virtually everyone unequivocally declared themselves in favour of maintaining the free distribution of food at the current level. I ask, therefore, why the voice of parliamentarians, who have a mandate from the electorate, is not being taken into consideration? I think we should be very aggrieved at this, because while the EU institutions so often appeal to the need to maintain solidarity, create equal opportunities and tackle exclusion, what credibility can they have in this situation?</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should also be reiterated that the fight against poverty is one of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. I am pleased that the importance of the programme for the free distribution of food in mitigating the effects of the crisis has been recognised by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who mentioned it in his speech today in the debate on the state of the Union. I appeal to the governments and the fellow Members from the Member States which are blocking the allocation of suitable resources to this commendable purpose, and would also like to ask them to change their position. In the draft Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020, a sum of EUR 2.5 billion has been reserved for this purpose, or EUR 350 million per year, whereas until now the programme has been receiving EUR 500 million per year, so this means a reduction of 30%. Therefore, the level of funds for the operation of this programme should be increased in the new financial framework to EUR 3.5 billion per year, so that we can maintain …</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are having here today should not even have had to take place. The most basic common sense and feeling of solidarity should already have resolved the problem that we are here today to discuss.</p>
      <p sl="pt">According to the estimate of the European Union itself, in Europe, which we consider to be the exponent of prosperity, freedom and justice, there are currently more than 40 million people at risk of food poverty, that is, without access to a full meal every two days.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In 2009, 440 000 tonnes of food were distributed to about 18 million people. No one is in any doubt that the situation will be worse in 2012. The economic and financial crisis, which continues to escalate, has thrown many people and families into unemployment against a backdrop of drastic cuts to social policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The attitude of the six Member States that blocked legislation enabling funding for food aid in 2012 to be maintained at the level of previous years is therefore incomprehensible and unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I welcome the gesture of the Commission – represented by you, Commissioner – which has tried to find a suitable legal solution to circumvent the issue raised by the Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The attitude of the Council reveals a shocking social insensitivity which goes against all the values on which European integration is based. I therefore completely denounce the recent position of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and call upon the Polish Presidency and the Heads of State or Government to resolve this problem once and for all at their next meeting, to overrule their Ministers for Agriculture, and to once again espouse the idea of solidarity and justice characteristic of Europe, which some ministers unfortunately seem to have forgotten.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we find ourselves in a very difficult situation here today regarding this programme. In my opinion – and I want to make this very clear – this programme belongs in social policy and not European agricultural policy. I believe that perhaps we should go further, and it should be a national responsibility. That is why we will support the move proposed by the Commission in its post-2014 MFF, which seeks a long-term solution to the problem and paves a way for a solution to be found when it is moved from Heading 1 to Heading 2.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the situation we face today concerning the next two years of this programme is completely and utterly unacceptable. We need to find a swift solution. The risk is clear. The money available to charities in 20 Member States will drop from EUR 500 million to only EUR 113 million if the Council continues to block a solution, leaving over 18 million poor in need who normally benefit from the programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is a scandalous situation that we find ourselves in. It is not acceptable to let this happen in 21st century Europe, especially at a time of crisis. We need to urge the Council to take their responsibilities seriously. Regardless of whether you believe the programme should be national or whether it should be moved to social policy, there is a duty to find a way forward to solve the problem for the next two years and to find a transitional solution to unlock the situation for the coming two years. The Council should work together with the Commission and Parliament to end this short-term deadlock.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to find a proper, agreed, solid basis for the long-term future of this programme. It is unacceptable that the poor should be taken hostage by this legal dispute and this inability of the Council to find a common line. It is now time that national governments took their responsibilities seriously and worked together with the Commission and this Parliament to come up with a quick solution that ensures that those who need this programme for the years 2012 and 2013 are satisfied and that their needs are met.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like the last speaker, I think we are in a difficult position on this particular issue. While I recognise this has helped over 18 million people and has done a tremendous job throughout the whole of the European Union in many areas where it is implemented, we are now in a position where the funding is seriously being questioned. We have to deal with this, and the Minister made it clear that stocks in 2013 are going to be more limited than they will have been in 2012. That is a reality. We all know that the security of food supply is not there as it has been in the past, and this is a tremendous challenge for us all.</p>
      <p sl="en">But like the previous speaker, let me say I have to question whether this should come out of an agricultural budget or the social budget. I think we have to get it right. We cannot just simply fudge something because we disagree with it in many ways, so which fund would pay? I think this is the bottom line and question. I would ask Commissioner Cioloş whether this fund is effective and efficient.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know about the waste of food and we have talked about the food that is being wasted throughout Europe. Is this the best way to deal with poverty? I think we have to get underneath this if we want to find a solution. I recognise there is a great risk of poverty throughout the whole of the European Union, and I recognise that and I want from the bottom of my heart to help, but we have to question it. I sincerely hope and trust that a solution to this problem can be found. I want the Agriculture Council to find that solution, because I do not believe we can simply turn a blind eye. However, I do not necessarily believe we are addressing the problem in the right way.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, the number of poor and unemployed people in the European Union continues to rise. More than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. The situation is critical. Today, six Member States want to put an end to the food aid programme with no replacement solution: Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Admittedly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has made a ruling and we have to respect it. Nevertheless, Commissioner, in June 2011, Parliament called on you, on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and you made appropriate proposals in order to protect the programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Verts/ALE Group is ready to work with you on long-term solutions; however, given that millions of people depend on this scheme, we cannot allow the food aid budget to be reduced by three-quarters. This is absolutely urgent. If nothing is done before the end of the year, the food banks will be lacking almost EUR 300 million, and there is no guarantee that the national governments will be able to step up to bridge that gap. This is therefore a real question of solidarity between people. We cannot allow a minority of irresponsible governments to deprive millions of Europeans of their food aid, because this is first and foremost a matter of survival.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fight against poverty and malnutrition also requires a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We need to make fundamental changes to our production methods in order to bring food production closer to the people, particularly the poorest, who also have a right to a healthy, balanced diet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. The Council needs to see reason, and let those in need have recourse to this vital aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am addressing the future Danish Government in particular, who will be responsible for taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January. They need to see reason. Will it take hunger riots in Europe in order for us to realise the urgent need to change our way of thinking? When it comes to saving the banks, the Council finds solutions, but when it is a matter of saving the food banks, nobody is interested.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, needy citizens do not want sympathy or cynicism. They want their rights as citizens to be turned into reality. Yesterday in this Chamber we discussed the human right to food security in developing countries and today we are dealing with the fact that some governments, including those of Germany, Denmark, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, are deliberately curtailing this right by refusing to continue with the ‘Food for Free’ programme. A total of 43 million people in the European Union are affected by food poverty, which means that they cannot afford a proper, balanced meal every second day. As many as 19 million people rely on the ‘Food for Free’ programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2010, the motto in Germany of the European year for combating poverty and social exclusion was ‘With new courage’. Anyone who treats poor people simply as statistics should have more courage themselves and ensure that sufficient, proper food is available for people in all regions of the European Union, on the basis of solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, the first lesson that I learnt at university, which was taught to me about economics, was that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Bulgaria has 2.5 million pensioners. I have told you many times and I will say it again that the average pension in Bulgaria is EUR 150.</p>
      <p sl="bg">When the charges for communal services and medication are deducted from this amount, there is virtually nothing left for food. If Mr Sawicki’s statement is true that it costs one euro for each citizen of the European Union to participate in the programme, this means that Bulgarian pensioners have contributed EUR 2.5 million from their money, which is inadequate even without this contribution.</p>
      <p sl="bg">At the same time, the programme in question does not operate in my country. Even though I want to add my voice to those of all my colleagues who spoke before me and I think that this programme must be continued, I would like to call on the Commissioner and the Commission to take measures to make this programme available to all the European Union’s citizens in need in every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I also thank Ms Zimmer for naming those countries which are currently blocking the decision in the Council. Since she mentioned them quickly due to the short duration of her speech, I would like to ask Mr Sawicki to repeat the names of these countries so that all of us and all European citizens who are here in the gallery and are watching us on the Internet can also hear who is blocking this decent social decision.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Mr Sawicki, ladies and gentlemen, along with several Member States, you, Mr Cioloş, and you, Mr Sawicki, have spoken out in favour of continuing food aid for needy people. As we have heard, a political decision is required to ensure that this takes place. However, the responsibility for this important area lies primarily with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not acceptable that people in Europe do not have enough to eat. It is part of the social responsibility of the Member States to ensure that they do. In Germany there are laws which guarantee sufficient food for all the citizens of the country. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union has changed the framework of the current aid programme. Strict limits have been set on market purchases. The Court has determined that the current programme in its current form does not comply with the legal basis of the Treaties. I know that we need to find answers in order to guarantee that the millions of needy people in the EU are given help. However, I would like to stress once again that the socio-political responsibility lies with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps we should also consider whether it would be better to establish programmes in the Member States rather than one European programme. These would be cofinanced with social funding from Brussels, in order to guarantee the provision of food aid in all Member States. This would also safeguard European solidarity, which I am firmly committed to, and enable the programmes to be continued. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will certainly help to find solutions for the people who are affected. I was once travelling in Brazil with a group of people when some young Brazilians asked us if they could have the food that we had left on our plates. I was shocked that something like this could happen in a rich agricultural country. We must make sure that people in Europe have enough to eat.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Sawicki, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, the food aid distribution programme for citizens at risk of poverty represents an extraordinarily important tool to sustain the most underprivileged in our society, an instrument that has been a success for the common agricultural policy in recent years and which enables the Union to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food each year to over 18 million poor people and families in difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="it">This number unfortunately includes many children and looks set to rise at a time when access to food is defined as a fundamental right. We therefore cannot but express incomprehension and opposition when faced with the blocking minority in favour of cutting aid which has emerged within the Council of Ministers for Agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are aware of the Court of Justice’s ruling and we will work to ensure that from 2013 there will be a text which will, of course, take account of the Court’s comments, but we certainly cannot allow this programme to be interrupted. I believe that, while Europe is today discussing a EUR 500 million programme of aid to its internal population, in the United States for over 40 years the US ‘Fair Deal’ law has been providing aid to the US population with a programme worth more than USD 20 billion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore argue that we must all redouble our efforts and in this respect I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and Mr Sawicki, and to commend Mr Cioloş, who has taken this matter to heart with courage and determination. We must find a solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at present 43 million people in the EU are at risk of food poverty, meaning that they cannot afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day. The blocking minority in Council towards this programme is unacceptable. Opposition to this scheme on the basis of competence, bureaucracy or budget are semantics that mean nothing to those who are hungry and rely on this programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the five objectives of the EU 2020 strategy is the reduction of poverty and social exclusion in the European Union. This programme represents a real method of physically addressing poverty that delivers immediate results. While it does not address the root causes of poverty it improves the immediate situation for those who cannot afford to feed themselves or their families. Sometimes we need to take the small goals and not always be looking at the ideological bigger picture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many EU programmes addressing poverty and social inclusion are very well intentioned and well written but they often stay on paper without ever benefiting the EU citizens they are targeting. This programme directly assists organisations and currently provides food for 13 million people suffering from poverty in 19 Member States and has distribution chains involving some 240 food banks and charities. That is real and measurable assistance on the ground, directly benefiting those who need it most and not just an aspirational goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">A little bit of common sense if not some compassion is required from EU leaders on this issue and I welcome the comments by the President of the Commission on this earlier today and also the contributions from the Commissioner and the Minister earlier in this debate. Now is not the time to be playing politics with such an important programme.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we have repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining a system of free food aid that benefits approximately 18 million people, as happened in 2009. Given that more than 43 million people are in a situation of extreme food poverty and at risk of food poverty, including 20 million children, and that even here in Europe people are sometimes obliged to rummage through bins because they have no food at home, it is unacceptable that this programme should be reduced from EUR 500 million to only EUR 113 million in 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is true that poverty requires other fundamental measures rather than so-called austerity measures, which are only exacerbating poverty and social exclusion, and it is vital to take into account Parliament’s resolution of 4 July, which includes the promotion of an agreement on guaranteed minimum income, based on 60% of the average national income of each Member State.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Mr Sawicki, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is undoubtedly the job of the public authorities to support people who live in poverty and that it is our job to ensure that our 500 million citizens at least have enough to eat. It is also undoubtedly the case that this programme will make us more popular and I believe that we are living in an era where popularity will not do us any harm.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to remind you that a relatively short time ago we adopted the Europe 2020 agenda in this House, which states that reducing poverty is one of our goals for 2020. If today we cancel a programme which is moving in this direction, this is not a consistent approach, taking into consideration the fact that food will definitely not become cheaper over the next few years, but in fact will be more expensive. This programme must be a genuine programme for combating poverty and it must be implemented together with the Member States, which are ultimately responsible for social policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must not be a programme which, as in some other countries, and the United States has already been mentioned, is simply an instrument of agricultural policy and which is aimed primarily at reducing surpluses.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the European Union we do not need the orders of magnitude that are used, for example, in the United States and that involve a significant percentage of the overall agricultural budget. Our agricultural policy works in a quite different way.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, it will be essential in the short term, in other words during the current financial framework, to restart this programme and to ensure that it continues. In the long term, we will have to consider on the basis of the court ruling whether the goal can better be achieved using other methods.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the European Council of Ministers for Agriculture failed to oppose a reduction of 75% in food aid to the most deprived. Seventy-five per cent!</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we see on the ground is that the blocking of this programme by a minority of Member States arouses outrage, incomprehension and exasperation among members of the public, charities and their volunteers and, of course, beneficiaries. This situation undermines the credibility and image of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our citizens are aware that Europe is devoting a great deal of energy and resources to reassuring the markets, as demonstrated in the speech given by Mr Barroso this morning, and that it is mobilising less and less to come to the aid of the populations hardest hit by the crisis. That gives rise to a feeling of injustice and mistrust of the European institutions, which is potentially explosive, socially and democratically.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, as you said, Parliament has taken its responsibilities seriously, as has the Commission. It is now up to the Member States, including France, whose leaders are shedding crocodile tears over this programme, to reach agreement.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we see it with the euro crisis, we see it with the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union: national self-interests are, sadly, back. The Member States are clinging tenaciously to them, and the principle of solidarity, which founded and inspired the creation of Europe, is being eroded day by day. This is not acceptable, especially when it affects the poorest, those who face the greatest hardships, and those who badly need to obtain food aid from charities. They now number more than 13 million in Europe, and Europe cannot and must not turn its back on them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you have made the point very effectively in everything you have said and written: ‘The European Union must not fail’. The Member States must therefore unblock their unacceptable deadlock. What is at stake, first and foremost, is the dignity of the poorest and most vulnerable, especially at a time when the crisis is engulfing our continent. What is also at stake, however, is the dignity of our European institutions.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, beyond all the fine speeches we hear here there is a double black stain on the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, can we go on recognising the rise in poverty as nothing more than a natural phenomenon? Rather, I believe that it is the mark of the failure of an ultraliberal Europe, and austerity will only make the situation worse. Secondly, there is an impending food disaster, because we are making ready to abolish food aid to the poorest at a time when it should be increased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What exactly is at issue here? We are planning to spend less than EUR 500 million to enable 18 million people to eat at least once every two days, when a programme has been put in place to allocate EUR 440 billion to protect the banks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, Commissioner, there are fewer agricultural measures, as was said earlier, but there are still export subsidies. There are, therefore, appropriations. On the other hand, we can also open a new chapter entitled ‘Social cohesion: aid for the most disadvantaged’. However, that cannot, I believe, be done by reducing social funds and cohesion funds.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now three years since the debate on the aid programme for the most deprived got desperately bogged down in Council. This untenable deadlock is not acceptable. It is all the more unacceptable given that the death sentence has been pronounced on the programme at a time when our continent is going through an economic and social crisis of unprecedented violence, which is throwing so many of our fellow citizens into turmoil.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some symbols construct Europe; others weaken it dangerously. Let us ensure that we do not destroy today what was patiently constructed yesterday, especially at a time when the difficulties we face seem to be straining the bonds that unite our States. Those same difficulties are pushing people towards nationalist sentiments and to turn their backs on Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Re-establishing the every man for himself principle as a normal and acceptable reflex is far removed from my idea of Europe and from that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to which I belong. Our people deserve better. They deserve the Europe we have been building together for more than 50 years – a Europe that is more than a simple economic agreement. Quite the opposite, Europe embodies values that, more than ever, we need to embrace – values that place human beings at the top of the political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, it is imperative that we move away from sterile legal debate in order to take fair and responsible political decisions. Allocating resources to the European Social Fund within a fund created specifically for that purpose under the revised common agricultural policy is not what the debate is about. It is no longer what the debate is about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ruling of the Court of Justice has now created an emergency which will soon affect 18 million people receiving food aid. The real question now relates to our common vision of Europe and its future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that its destiny does not, under any circumstances, lie in the full or partial renationalisation of food aid, however symbolically. Let there be no mistake: only if we act together will we succeed in tackling the huge challenges we face today. It is only by acting together, showing solidarity and standing united that, on our continent, we will retain the resources to guarantee the future prosperity of all our fellow citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">However, it should be reiterated that it is not Europe that is responsible; it is the six governments of the countries that have already been mentioned, but which need to be mentioned again: the governments of Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden. What is more, these countries are not among the poorest in the European Union, but they are among the most selfish – or are becoming selfish. What those countries really need to understand is that they must take their responsibilities seriously. Do they want to be responsible for, guilty of, and complicit in not giving assistance to people in danger? That is in fact what it is all about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The programme is worth maintaining, especially at a time of crisis, and for the 10 million most deprived citizens of Europe. In three months it will be winter. Solutions must be found, of course, for after 2014 but, more importantly, transitional solutions must be found for 2012 and 2013. We must adhere to the letter of the law; we must withdraw the agriculture budget and transfer it to social cohesion under the heading ‘Fund for the most deprived’. Europe must not shirk its responsibilities. The Member States are, of course, jointly responsible, but Europe cannot ‘cop out’ when it comes to this very important social dimension.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, allow me, first of all, to say how pleased I am, just as other colleagues are in today’s debate, that President Barroso had the decency to mention this important topic of food aid programmes in his speech that he gave this morning on the state of the Union. At present, 18 million Europeans benefit from this programme. This means that more than one European in 30 has received food aid. The whole EU is battling against the repercussions of the crisis, and the risk of poverty has increased. The fight against social exclusion is one of the most important aims of the European Union’s social policy, and the lack of food is the toughest of all forms of exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Just this morning President Barroso said here before us in Parliament that the intention of political institutions is to make possible what is necessary. This is why I firmly believe that solutions can be found to get us out of the current legal stalemate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As far as the costs involved with food aid are concerned, we should remember that every European citizen produces 180 kilograms of food refuse every year, which is an astounding level of waste. This means that every year half of the food in Europe is thrown away and turned into refuse. Limiting this waste would enable us to provide the necessary food to all the poor people in Europe and more. It is ethically unacceptable to ignore these people. Food aid programmes, which have been operating successfully for a quarter of a century, must continue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make one thing clear in advance. As a Social Democrat, it is important to me to help needy people. However, for me the focus is primarily on creating jobs, in order to enable people to take care of themselves. In my opinion, the food aid programme for needy people in its current form is not the right way of helping people to help themselves. I see this as charity, which is damaging to people’s dignity.</p>
      <p sl="de">It seems relatively clear to me that buying food and distributing it free of charge to needy people is not agricultural policy. It falls within the realms of social policy. Under the terms of the current legal basis, social policy is a matter for the Member States. In Germany there is a system of food banks. Volunteer helpers collect food which can no longer be used by supermarkets, for example. Given the fact that 89 million tonnes of food goes to landfill every year in Europe, initiatives of this kind make sense, but they are also charitable in nature.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, our arguments are surely a statement of the obvious. The ‘Food for Free’ programme urgently needs to be maintained, especially in the current social crisis. As such, the drastic cuts in funds proposed for 2012 are unacceptable. We are calling directly for a new legal framework, so that full use can be made of funds available in the current financial period and the programme can continue after 2013. Apart from the need for agricultural produce to be supplied from government stocks and from the market, the selection of products distributed must not be restricted to products subject to intervention and the facility should be provided for a broader choice in each Member State, based on real needs. The Commission recommends the introduction of financing. Of course we understand the difficulty, if not the impossibility, that this proposal implies for certain Member States that have greater need of the programme. Finally, to those asking for food programmes to be renationalised under each Member State’s social policies, I would reply that, apart from its social dimension, the programme helps to stabilise agricultural markets and farmers’ income in the Union. More to the point, it symbolises a minimum expression of solidarity with its destitute citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this issue is not an issue of subsidiarity, as social assistance and the fight against poverty are the concern of everyone in the European Union. It is not a secondary issue; it is a major issue. It is about enabling people living in extreme poverty to feed themselves, rather than having to live on handouts. No Member State can circumvent these objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The President of the European Commission told us this morning that it was time the financial sector paid for the damaged caused by this crisis. We say that it is also time the European Union budget continued to help the outstanding work carried out on the ground by those running the food banks with a view to enabling people living in extreme poverty to have access to a little dignity. Nor will we agree to organise solidarity between the poor. If this programme is to be financed – and it no doubt should be, as social assistance, under the European Social Fund – it will have to be compensated for.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President-in-Office of the Council, we are telling you now, it is on the basis of your capacity to resolve this issue on Monday as a matter of urgency that we will judge your presidency.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of us is indifferent to the fact that 80 million people in the European Union are at risk of poverty and 14 million are dependent on the food programme. Worse still, this trend may be growing.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The most important thing is for the Commission to find a proper basis for the existing food programme and any new one. Suddenly stopping and drastically reducing the aid provided causes more harm in the long term than good in the short term.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I have a few more important points to make. This aid must certainly be granted to those who really need it so as to prevent dependency on it. However, dependency can be overcome by providing opportunities for these people to develop. Dire need should not, in most cases, be confused with dependency either.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, the role of the Structural Funds and their suitability is very important. However, they are also based on the importance of ensuring that people have good-quality, healthy nutrition, right from childhood and for the whole of their life. Our role is to help people so that shortage of food does not lead to dependency and dependency does not preclude development.</p>
      <p sl="bg">On a global scale, more general actions such as those involving the UN agency send a very powerful message which the European Union is conveying outside our continent. Finally, the fight against hunger is a Millennium Development Goal. Even more importantly than this, we are fighting for a new CAP, which cannot be allowed to sustain differences and create new injustices.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Let us not lose sight of our values and principles and let us keep our word, which we gave right at the very outset.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European programme for deprived persons has helped achieve social policy objectives, in addition to fulfilling the agricultural aspect. The programme has proved to be an important instrument for certain groups of people affected by poverty, especially against the backdrop of the current economic and financial crisis. This is why I think that the EU needs to provide support to deprived persons at a comparable level to this year, in the knowledge that the common agricultural policy has a social element. After all, people in need have still to be given assistance. Based on the principle of European solidarity, the six Member States must prove that they understand the situation of the groups suffering poverty and agree to continue the programme under the necessary conditions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have a duty to respond to the plight of the most deprived persons who benefit from the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD). We are particularly committed to the sustainability of this programme, which is an expression of European solidarity. I have three messages, the first of which is for the Presidency. I would like to say that the Council will be watched closely in this regard and that it must prove itself worthy of the founding values of Europe and crush this pitiful blocking minority. To the European Commission I would like to say that it is logical to back your proposal, Commissioner, to link the PEAD to the European Social Fund. However, the European Social Fund is the most important tool of social integration through professional integration. I therefore ask that it be fully preserved and that it be supplemented by the food aid needed by the most deprived. We will be extremely vigilant on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, my third message is to Parliament. All the Members of Parliament in this House are fully committed to this programme. However, I want to ask the Members of Parliament of those countries forming the blocking minority to send a message to their governments, today, that they must put an end to this shameful situation, which is a stain on Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, let us indeed talk about solidarity and the poor. In the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting, a blocking minority opposed the amendment to the regulation governing food aid to the most disadvantaged. Mr Sawicki has already explained their reasons.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the Council should be reminded that 60% of the funds is needed to feed the 79 million people in Europe who live below the poverty line. Those funds are provided by national, regional and local governments, and by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Up until last April, the European Union contributed 40%.</p>
      <p sl="es">The position taken by the blocking minority would lead to a drastic reduction in aid for next year, and a complete abolition by 2013. We condemn this.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I do not want to repeat what everyone has already said, but I believe that, today, Europe does in fact have a real problem of credibility as a result of what is happening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are being put on trial. We are being told, on the one hand, that there is the European policy and, on the other, that there is the policy of the Member States. However, if the Treaty of Rome of 1958 tells us that we must ensure that all Europeans are fed and that we must guarantee food security, this is a European policy. It is not a policy of the Member States</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, this situation shows, in addition to the selfishness of a number of Member States, that what is lacking is not more Europe but rather a European will on the part of a number of Heads of State or Government.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think the message from this House is very clear. We want this programme to continue because of its humanitarian aspect. I was listening to the lengthy debate and I was just wondering whether those who benefit from meals at the food bank are troubled by the legal base under which the food they are eating comes? Do they worry about the sort of detail that we worry about in this Parliament? There are plenty of brains in this room to come up with a solution. I do not want to condemn the Member States who are blocking this; I do not think that is a good way forward. I want to try and persuade them of the value of this programme for the solidarity of the European Union. I want to see a short-term solution for the next two years but I would also like, as Jim Nicholson has said, to review what we might do post-2014. Sometimes you need to do things differently, but we have an immediate problem. For example, there is in Ireland EUR 1 million which will be lost for food aid, so a short-term solution is needed.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I am here to add my voice to those of all my fellow Members who, on 4 July 2011 and again today, unanimously supported you in your attempt to rid the EU of the shame that has befallen it, following the incomprehensible decision taken by a minority of five Member States in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is absolutely unacceptable that a few Member States, which do not even participate in this programme, are preventing Europe from moving forward in its solidarity and support. This is not support for those trying to combat poverty, because that is not the aim of this programme. Let us make no mistake: this programme is intended to fight against hunger.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are 80 million poor people in Europe, but 13 million people rely on this programme for food. There is no legal or budgetary justification for blocking it, because if we ask Members of the European Parliament and our citizens, they will say that any area of the budget can be cut apart from this one.</p>
      <p sl="es">Please keep up your work, Commissioner. Make the Council reverse its decision. The press and the citizens of Europe must be made aware that the Members of the European Parliament do not want this shame to befall us. I urge you to seek a solution based on solidarity; not one that means the poor looking after the poor but, rather, the well-off looking after the poor.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to help clear up a misunderstanding. The principle of subsidiarity not only protects the prerogative of individual states, but also clearly points to the fact that if any State does not have the capacity to act, action is taken at the next level to the extent that subsidiarity allows.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is what underpins the Commission’s opportunity for intervention, as is well understood by the Polish Presidency and the European Commission. In these circumstances, we can therefore do nothing other than mobilise our efforts to respond to the needs of 18 million people to whose needs some countries are evidently incapable of administering on a national level.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must do this and in doing it must we also take care: that is to say, do we wish to move this into the social arena? Excellent. Beware, however. We could lose the benefits of the agricultural sector supply chain, which has been able to deal efficiently with surpluses, and we could also perhaps lose the opportunity of clarifying when social issues should have national competence and when they have EU competence.</p>

Last year, we marked the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Unfortunately, it has turned out to be a rather symbolic action. Now, when we need to turn words into deeds, there are governments which are openly committing to a lack of solidarity with the European Union’s deprived citizens.</p>

At a time when there are more than 40 million people in need, I believe that it is immoral both to oppose this programme and to abandon the issue of funding the programme to red tape. This is why I call on the Commission to resolve the issue of providing funding from the agriculture budget and to continue providing food aid to the poorest citizens in the EU at the same level as up until now.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to provide some information and clarify a few points following the comments made by some of you, not to convince those who are already convinced of the need to keep this programme going, but perhaps to send messages to those who need to hear them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some say that a social policy programme is, perhaps, a programme at national level. Why should this programme not fall within social policy? As I have already said, the Commission has made its choice: for the period 2014-2020, it proposes to include the budget for this programme in social inclusion and cohesion policy. That is possible. Should it be a national matter? I think it is a political decision that needs to be taken here and, in my opinion, the majority is going to opt for the period 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question we are currently asking ourselves concerns the years 2012 and 2013. For that period, Parliament, like the Council, was in agreement, when adopting the budget, that the programme would fall under the common agricultural policy (CAP). It is true that things have changed, but I wish to confirm and further strengthen the idea that the Court of Justice of the European Union does not call a regulation into question. The Court of Justice of the European Union simply requests that a regulation in force be complied with. The Commission is now proposing to amend this regulation so that we can make progress. It is not up to the Court of Justice to take political decisions. I think there are bodies in Europe to do that. The Commission calls on the institutions that have to take political decisions to take them. The Commission has done its work by putting forward a legislative proposal taking account of the observations of the Court of Justice, However the Court of Justice does not limit purchases on the markets. It simply says that the regulation currently in force does not permit them. So let us change the regulation. A regulation is made to be amended.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that this programme will be integrated into social policy as of 2014 does not prevent us from taking the decision today – as I said – with a common legal basis. We are maintaining the legal basis for agriculture because, for 2012, we have stocks of more than EUR 100 million. For 2012, therefore, this programme cannot fall within social policy alone, because we have stocks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission proposes to maintain the dual legal basis – the CAP and social policy. That is what it will propose at the Employment and Social Affairs Council, which will take place early next week. I hope that the Employment and Social Affairs Council or the next Agricultural Council will arrive at a decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Comments were also made concerning cofinancing. A number of Member States were unable to afford the cofinancing proposed by the Commission in the legislative proposal on the table. As I have said on a number of occasions, the Commission is prepared to look again at this cofinancing idea if that is what is blocking the decision. It is my hope that we will be able to take a decision, because I know that the Polish Presidency is just as determined as the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the effectiveness of these funds – an issue raised by Mr Nicholson – and waste, we will have a chance to see how, as of 2014, we will be able to improve the functioning of this programme. As to its effectiveness, it is one of the programmes for which figures are available: 440 million tonnes are being distributed to 18 million beneficiaries. There are clearly beneficiaries behind the use of this money. This money – these EUR 500 million a year – which we have used until now, is often used as leverage to collect products that are not wasted. As you know, mass distribution retail shops also frequently contribute, along with food banks, to topping up reserves intended for the most deprived. This money is also used as leverage. In the Member States, the overall value of the programme is well in excess of EUR 500 million, but this money is used as leverage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the points I wanted to make, once again, in the hope – and I could almost say the conviction – that, with the Council, we will be able to find a majority of MEPs to enable this programme to continue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not yet too late but, in a few months’ time, it could be. I hope that will not be the case.</p>

It was then that the blocking minority came into being. As you know, since that time we have now had six presidencies, and beginning with the French Presidency, each of them has passed this difficult problem on, like a hot potato, to the next one. I would like to say very clearly that the Polish Presidency does not want to share this issue with the next presidency. We will make every effort for this problem to be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also want to point out that as a politician I am a little ashamed that the blocking group consists of Member States which formerly benefited very substantially from market intervention instruments and when stocks were high saw nothing wrong in giving them to those who were most in need. Today, when there are no intervention stocks, we have made this into an artificial legal problem. However, the Commissioner is saying clearly that this is neither a legal problem, nor is it a financial problem, it is a problem of a political decision. Indeed, you have adopted the ‘six pack’ here today to secure the financial situation of the big banks. Are those six governments not ashamed that no decision has been made about small change for 18 million people?</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased that this is a public debate here, today. I did not have my head in the sand last week when I raised the subject in public debate in Council, so that European society would have a clear idea of who is blocking this decision and why, and now I trust, Mr President, I trust that after this debate the consciences of the governments which are blocking the decision will be reawakened.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The ‘Food for Free’ programme is targeted at people who worry whether they will be able to feed their children tomorrow; people who do not think about what they will eat that night for dinner, but about whether they will have anything to eat, and people who only eat in soup kitchens. I agree that we must do more to guarantee the nutritional quality of the food distributed. It is important that good-quality food is provided, which is as fresh as possible. I think that today’s debate should send out a very clear message: do not forget about those waiting at the soup kitchen or waiting to receive the next food parcel.

      <p sl="ro">The funds allocated to the food aid programme in 2012 will be reduced to less than a quarter of this year’s budget. There is the risk that in 2013 the programme will stop due to opposition from six EU Member States to the possibility of continuing to support the most deprived citizens from the common agricultural policy budget, as has happened until now.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Apart from the technical discussion about transferring food aid from the EU agriculture budget to Member States’ social budgets, there is actually a lack of political will from the six governments from Central and Western Europe to contribute to a solidarity programme for Europe’s poorest citizens, at a time when their number is steadily rising due to the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to say how much I appreciate the readiness shown by Commissioner Dacian Cioloș to come up with a solution for continuing the food aid programme, a system introduced back in 1987 by the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors.</p>

      <p sl="fr">European solidarity is clearly in danger. This was shown by the reluctance of some Member States to help Greece. The scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD) is another example. The legal argument put forward by certain Member States is merely a pretext; it is in fact simply a question of political will. Parliament has shown that it is willing to help the most deprived through its initiatives on the subject, including on poverty reduction, which is a fundamental objective of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the initiatives you have undertaken with the same determination.

      <p sl="el">Following its amendment in 2010, the programme was extended to the foods that it covers, including fruit, vegetables and cooking oil. There was a reason for that. It was to improve the nutritional balance of the programme. Rightly so, because it would be hypocritical on our part to operate a programme which distributes free food purely and simply to offload stocks from the common agricultural policy, with no regard for the nutritional needs of our fellow citizens. The EU may have stopped dumping on the international markets but, if we operate the programme like that, it is equivalent to dumping food on destitute people in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In the European Union 79 million people live below the poverty line, and last year 18 million citizens received food provided by the scheme for ‘food distribution to the most deprived persons’.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are going through an economic crisis where there are visible signs of growing poverty, especially due to the pressure of the austerity measures being applied by some governments, and the number of people suffering from hunger is steadily rising. I feel it is unacceptable that, at a particularly difficult time like this, we are having discussions about cutting the budget allocated to this programme or about funding it from Member States’ budgets. Such decisions would be irresponsible. I think that this programme must be kept as one of our priorities, as a European scheme funded from the CAP budget, even if the food distributed is taken from the market and not from intervention stocks.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I want to ask the Polish Presidency to exert pressure for this mechanism guaranteeing the most deprived groups access to food to be maintained. The right to food is a fundamental right and we must do everything we can to provide this right to our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Food for Free programme has been helping people at risk of poverty for 20 years now. The Czech Republic is one of the countries not backing the draft regulation. In its opinion it states that this issue requires a solution at national level through social policy and not at European level, including future regulations on spending from the European Social Fund. Allowing the purchase of food on the market, and thereby retreating from the earlier main objective of the targeted use of EU intervention stocks, now places this issue beyond the agenda of the common agricultural policy. The opinion, unfortunately, does not offer an actual solution for a programme which every year helps 18 million of the poorest people. I firmly believe that all of the players should particularly bear this fact in mind when looking for a way out of the current stalemate.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Millions of Europeans risk being pushed into deeper poverty because of the harsh and rigid stance of six Member States. At a time when increasing numbers of Europeans are feeling the effect of the banking crisis and are in need of food aid, these countries are turning off the tap. Not because they have no money, but because they think that this kind of social policy is better left to the exclusive competence of Member States. That is typical of a liberal vision of Europe that only has an economic, and rarely a social, dimension. They are still failing to understand the fact that a strong European social policy, which guarantees every Member State minimum rights, brings benefits to all. It is, therefore, no surprise that the obstructions to this are those countries which are pushing for a harsh austerity policy without addressing the social consequences. Neither is it a coincidence that precisely these countries are more and more openly calling European solidarity into question. One of the signals we have already received is the fact that these countries have been undermining, in a brutal and irresponsible fashion, the commendable work of many volunteers working for food banks, non-profit organisations and charities as part of the European Year of Volunteering. They would be better to follow the example of the selfless work of thousands of volunteers in order to build a better society and one with greater solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Everyone here agrees that the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD) is a tangible and effective demonstration of the solidarity of the Union. Unfortunately, a minority of irresponsible Member States are persisting with their blockade in the Council for ideological and financial reasons. Today, the citizens are watching us and they do not understand why Europe is not doing more to step up to the challenge of poverty. This political posturing, at such an inopportune moment, is terrible for the image of the EU. At a time when, with winter approaching, the vulnerability of the most deprived is at its highest, we are jeopardising the essential work of the European food banks. Although this programme represents only 1% of the budget of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and benefits more than 13 million Europeans in need each year, the idea that savings can be made at its expense therefore seems to me totally inappropriate and intolerably cynical. The ball is now in the court of the Council, which absolutely must come to its senses at the next meeting of agriculture ministers. As the Commission and Parliament have proposed a new legal basis to maintain this programme, the Council can no longer hide behind the law</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Professor Kraszewski, Ms Hedegaard, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament very much welcomes the fact that the United Nations is holding the Rio+20 conference. We are submitting a resolution to the European Parliament which has been sponsored by Members from a number of different political groups, in other words, it has broad support in this House, and which states that this Earth summit next year in Brazil must be a success.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look back 20 years to the first Rio conference in 1992, there was a huge amount of commitment and hope that we would be able to reverse the trend in our economic activities on this planet. When we consider what has happened over the last 20 years, there has certainly been a lot of commitment. Some things have been achieved, but the trends and the megatrends are still going in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at the economy, and we discussed it at length this morning, we can see that a financial economy has developed alongside the real economy, which is far more powerful than the traditional economy. The speculation in the financial economy is threatening the real economy and also jeopardising whole countries and regions and many, many people.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at developments in the social sector over the last 20 years, there is incredible wealth and unfortunately also incredible poverty. The divide between rich and poor is getting wider. If we move on to the environment, it is clear that our environmental footprint on this planet is still a negative one. Over the last 20 years we have cleared huge areas of forest. We have overfished the seas. We have used up energy resources which took millions of years to form. We have damaged the soil. These are warning signs for the 21st century which indicate to us that we cannot go on like this. There must be a change of direction. We really need to make a renewed attempt to introduce sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need a new departure next year in Rio. We need a new political will and a new sense of commitment. We also need an agenda with concrete proposals. It is clear that the three pillars – the economy, the environment and social development – must be better integrated. Economic activities are a good thing, but the economy must serve people and the environment. An economy which destroys people and the environment is not a good economy. We must redefine our economic activities in this broader context. Parliament has made a number of proposals about what is needed: the creation of the right basic conditions, regulation, but also marketable instruments, which will help the economies in our countries to bring in private capital, and the management of natural capital in order to prevent it from being overused and to intervene when ecosystems are exploited.</p>
      <p sl="de">The balance sheet for our activities is the gross domestic product or GDP. We know that GDP is no longer adequate, because it does not tell the whole truth about our activities from an environmental and social perspective. This is why we believe that the leitmotif for the next few years, for the next decade, must be a sustainable economy, a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that people all over the world do not have fair access to resources. We see large estates being bought up and in many countries, including in Africa, there is the risk that people will no longer be able to cultivate their own food as a result of land theft. This is a phenomenon which we need to devote our attention to.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear that many people do not have access to energy. Around 2 billion people have no proper, regular energy supply, which is a huge disadvantage in terms of development. Access to water is by no means evenly distributed all over the world. I only want to mention these three issues. However, there are other obstacles which prevent people from accessing resources easily because they are poor, underprivileged or have other problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">To make sustainable development possible, we need to shift the burden of taxes paid by the citizens of our countries. Currently the major part of the tax burden relates to the work which is done and it is clear that this tax burden must be reduced and shifted from work to the consumption of natural resources and energy. This is an important subject for which we also need the support of the finance ministers and ministers of economic affairs in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say in conclusion that sustainability requires commitment from the local level through to the global level. Civil society is a very important resource. People must take part and we must involve them. The state has a job to do, but the private sector also has responsibilities. We must ensure that the private sector does more to make use of its knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainability. At a global level, we simply need better governance, a better structure, in order to organise these environmental and sustainable trends. In Rio we will be discussing whether the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) is adequate in its current form. The answer is clear: it is not. We need better structures at a global level. We in Parliament are hoping that the EU will speak with one voice. We will have a delegation in Durban and we will help to ensure that Europe sets itself a genuine target and plays a pioneering role. We need an agenda 2020 for sustainable development on this planet.</p>

    <intervention id="3-377-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andrzej Kraszewski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, Mr Potočnik, honourable Members, it is indeed the case that at the present time achieving sustainable development is probably the most important role of environment protection. Twenty years have now passed, and we are on the eve of an important conference, which on the 20th anniversary of the first one is going to try, firstly, to do a stocktake of everything which has been done in the field of sustainable development. Secondly, it is going to try to map out new courses of action so that this development can be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am sure that all of you – and also very many people who are interested in matters relating to environment protection – are asking yourselves the same question which I heard in Mr Leinen’s speech: have we done everything possible to be able to say that sustainable development is on the right road? I do not have a very good opinion about this. I think that although we have made certain important advances, we have not done what we should have done. This therefore is why I think the Council has a very important task, so that here, too, the European Union will be a leader – just as it is in other fields – and so that an ambitious plan and ambitious conclusions will be drafted for this important conference next year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The subjects of the conference are the green economy and institutional changes, which are also very much needed. This does not exhaust, of course, the question of sustainable development, but the green economy is something which – if I may repeat what Mr Leinen said – is an absolute necessity. How many examples do we still have, even in developed countries, of linear economies which operate on the principle of take, make, sell, use and dispose? This has to stop. The earth cannot afford to squander resources in this way. This is a very important factor. It is a factor which is not only to do with technology, but is about educating a new kind of consumer. A consumer who will know the importance of resources, who will know the importance of what the earth gives him, and who will know how to use those resources in such a way, firstly, as to conserve energy and raw materials, and secondly, he will know he should recycle what he uses. The conclusions we are working on now are about all of these matters.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to thank Parliament very sincerely for giving thought to this matter and for adopting its own document, one which lends us support in our work. This is important for us, because thanks to this our document will be better.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question of institutional changes is equally important, because we think that the current UN institution – the United Nations Environment Programme – is not enough in view of the challenges being faced by the modern world. We support the establishment of a specialised UN agency which will have a mandate which has been fully discussed and which will be able to work efficiently towards achieving, among other things, the priority objective of sustainable development. This is very important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This does not mean we have not considered the social agenda, which is the third pillar of sustainable development. The conference, which will take place next year in Rio, will give time to the fight against poverty. This is extremely important, because the social dimension should on the one hand work against excessive consumerism and the type of economy which is happier the more humanity consumes, but which on the other hand should also care for those among us – the people of this planet – who very often do not have basic living conditions. Therefore, this other aspect of this work, which will also be discussed at the conference, is very important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, the things which I have discussed here in brief will be contained in the conclusions we are working on now. We are working on them at the moment, and this includes questions of finance. I have to say that the Polish Presidency has made these questions one of its priorities, and in two weeks we will be holding a Rio+20 conference in Poland, which will consider these very matters and where we will discuss these questions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Once again I would like to thank you very sincerely for inviting me to this important sitting. In coming here I am fulfilling, in a measure, the promise I made during the hearing before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, that I would try to talk often with Parliament and with Members of Parliament. We have not finished yet, so I hope there will also be other opportunities for this. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to outline the main objectives for the European Union for the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development: Rio+20. As you have probably noticed, in his speech this morning, the President outlined Rio+20 as one of the major external action activities on which the Commission will focus next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also delighted that Commissioner Hedegaard is able to join me for this debate, particularly as she is a member of the United Nations Global Sustainability Panel and as I know that the resolution of this House particularly draws attention to the links with climate issues. I should also say that Commissioner Piebalgs is closely involved in the development of the European Union position for the summit, in view of the development and poverty eradication aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rio+20 is a unique opportunity for the world, and for the European Union, to advance its commitments on sustainable development through both themes which will be discussed there: firstly, the green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication and secondly, the institutional framework for sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the green economy, we need to be clear that this is a vehicle for delivering on sustainable development. It can secure growth and development and, at the same time, contribute to improving human well-being, providing decent jobs, tackling poverty and preserving natural capital. It offers opportunities for countries in all stages of economic development. Building on the Commission’s communication ‘Rio+20: towards the green economy and better governance’, adopted in June, we are now working towards a consolidated European Union position in time for the 1 November UN deadline for international input. Discussions with Member States are still ongoing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our objective should be to make sure that Rio+20 will give renewed political impetus to sustainable development through an ambitious vision, goals and tangible actions at both international and also national levels. Any such vision and goals will have to be backed with tangible action. On the green economy we propose to focus on the efficient and sustainable management of resources and natural capital: water, renewable energy, oceans, sustainable agriculture and fishing, and materials and chemical management. This reflects the approach we set out in the resource efficiency roadmap, as part of the EU 2020 strategy, which the Commission adopted last week.</p>
      <p sl="en">The enabling conditions for the transformation towards a green economy in these areas can be established through the right kinds of regulatory and market conditions, mobilising public and private financial resources and also investing in capacity building. We envisage that a green economy roadmap should map out all actions undertaken at international level with specific time frames to ensure commitment well into the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a complement to international actions and commitments, national actions would depend on national circumstances and could be supported with measures such as best practice examples and policy guidelines. Examples of specific international actions include the strengthening and expanding of the European Union Water Initiative, including new agreements on the Law of the Sea, particularly in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and establishing an international regime on chemicals. To monitor progress it will be essential to develop indicators and a globally agreed system of economic, environmental and social accounting. Through such concerned actions the sustainable management of resources in key sectors such as water, energy, oceans and forests can become the thrust of future economic growth and global markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sectors we propose underpin the livelihoods of many and are, particularly in developing countries, linked to basic subsistence. Access to water, food and energy are some of the basic human needs that must be met to alleviate poverty. Please do not imagine that resource efficiency is only a concern for developed countries. It is also of crucial importance for the sustainable development of developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, to reinforce global sustainable development and environmental governance through institutional reform is also essential. Strengthening sustainable development governance could be achieved by the reinforcement of ECOSOC in the United Nations or the establishment of a Council on Sustainable Development. These are the potential ways forward and we need to enhance the UN Environment Programme, possibly by upgrading it into a specialised agency. As I stated clearly in the plenary of the European Economic and Social Committee last week, Rio will also have to establish means for greater participation of business and civil society. I absolutely hope and count on your strong support and your presence in Rio.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to apologise that I will have to leave the House before we conclude the debate because I have to catch the flight to Amsterdam and Berlin. On Saturday morning I am flying to New Delhi in India. We will have the preparatory ministerial meeting for Rio+20, where we will discuss precisely the issues which we are discussing together today and a part of our agenda. I want us to show via the European presence that we want to be active in all stages and also on all levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as I mentioned, last week we adopted the resource efficiency roadmap, which I hope will be supported by the Council and Parliament. Actually I do not doubt this after hearing both of the speakers before me, because many of the things which you both mentioned are indeed part of the substance of that resource efficiency roadmap. In a way it is also the roadmap to the green economy. So via that we would become a real, credible partner internationally, because we would show that we know how we have to clean up our own house in a way that shows how the work should be done in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to share some views also from the side of global climate policy and how to position the European Union best in the run-up to the Rio Conference on Sustainable Development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, let me share a few points from the work of the Global Sustainability Panel, established by Ban Ki-Moon with the very clear view that we should give some recommendations for the Rio+20 Conference. The Panel will have its last meeting in December and will publish its recommendations by the middle of January, in time hopefully to make an impact on the Rio+20 process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sustainable development as defined by the Brundtland Commission in 1987 and as agreed in Rio in 1992 was never truly realised. Patterns of growth and consumption are by and large the same as before. Unfortunately, emerging economies did not learn enough from the mistakes made by us, the developed countries – the principle of grow first and clean up later – but this cannot be a growth strategy for the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead we need political leadership to set a new growth agenda: growth, yes – but the important question will be ‘what kind of growth?’ It must be a growth that includes environmental and social concerns at the same level as economic ones. New indicators of growth, way beyond GDP, are necessary. We need to measure well-being of people and preservation of nature, and of course this agenda must appeal equally to developed and developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The world must also move away from the old north-south paradigm. We must move towards a paradigm of mutual interdependence. Interdependence in a globalised world is a strong driver for change. It is linked to population growth and growing resource scarcity. Business as usual will take this planet beyond its natural boundaries with catastrophic effects. We need science to guide political decisions on all environmental boundaries. A call for urgency must come out of Rio.</p>
      <p sl="en">The focus of the Panel’s work has been the interlinked nexus of energy, food and water, with climate change as an overarching theme. The world community has already been mobilised on climate change. Climate change is still there and is also there in the minds of the people. It is important that we do not change from one topic to another. It is still the overarching theme and how we address it – and that we address it globally – is still decisive for what kind of world we will have in this 21st century. So climate change must still be an overarching theme.</p>
      <p sl="en">To the very relevant points made by Mr Potočnik I would just add two other points for emphasis, first on energy. Eliminating energy poverty is a precondition to eradicating poverty. In the panel we therefore consider targets for access to energy, for sustainable energy and for renewable energy sources. At the same time, the global energy system – supply, transformation, delivery and use – is the dominant contributor to climate change, representing around 60% of total current greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am glad to see highlighted in Parliament’s resolution that the transition towards a green economy requires a radical transformation of the energy sector. I think this is absolutely crucial and I actually believe this is one of the areas where hopefully Rio+20 can deliver a very specific recommendation that can lead to immediate action. This of course requires concerted and coordinated effort, but I think it is very important that we in Europe push in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just mention a second point. Part of the reason for the inadequate progress on sustainability is evident: there is a significant market failure that we must correct, namely inadequate pricing. The negative consequences of the way we exploit nature and the environment are not usually visible or immediate. This must be corrected. Their externality and invisibility allows the end user often to remain ignorant of this kind of cost related to our growth, so the price signals to the markets and consumers today are flawed. To change this, people, corporations and governments must be made aware of the full effects of their choices. In other words, we need to price things in a way that reflects the true costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Internalisation of the external effects means factoring in the consequences, thereby making them a part of the decision-making process. This means introducing market-based instruments such as taxes, charges and emission trading, in order to give economic incentives to limit external effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this pricing issue should also be a very prominent issue for Rio+20. I think that with these things – access to sustainable energy and the pricing issue – among a lot of other recommendations in Rio, we could deliver something that would result in immediate action when we come back from Rio because, with many of the other things, we all know that it will take a very long time before we see them in the real world. Here are some tangible things that could lead to immediate action. I think it is very important also to focus on that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my early years as a Member of this House, I went to Rio in 1992 and I followed carefully what was decided and what we have actually implemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Kraszewski, many of the things that you have said are right, including that we must push ahead with developing a green economy in Europe and throughout the world. However, Mr Potočnik, we must begin in Europe. When I consider that in Eastern European countries rubbish is still being put into landfill, while waste in other, more developed countries is taken to incinerators where it is burnt without giving this a thought, I realise that we need to set a good example. Fortunately, you have indicated that we need to work closely on one of these three pillars.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Leinen mentioned the problem of poverty. I would like to look again at the three major issues: social concerns, the economy and the environment. In Europe and throughout the world these things are not sufficiently integrated. They are like trains which run on one track, then somewhere there is a crash and the end result is an unhappy one.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we must find the strength together to ensure that these trains run in parallel on the tracks, so that we can achieve joint results. Then there will no longer be these unnecessary disputes. In 2050 when there are 9 billion people living on the planet, there will be no alternative to sustainability. That is where we in Western Europe must make the most of the opportunity not only to develop elegant technologies, but also to sell them all over the world. This is one of my major concerns.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ms Hedegaard, once you have won an election, you must begin campaigning for the next election the very next day. This is what we need to do in the case of the United Nations. We have always said that we do not like the structures there. You are right about that. That is the way it is in Europe and we have discussed this in detail this morning. The structures at the UN are acceptable, but they do not function effectively.</p>
      <p sl="de">Immediately after this conference we must begin changing these structures and at some point we must move away from the rule of unanimity. We have just heard here this morning that the people who fight for causes like this very often do not have good intentions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the Rio+20 summit highlights the crucial principle of fairness.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fairness on an international scale that guarantees developing countries their right to development; intergenerational fairness that does not make those who come after us pay the price for our decisions; fairness that thus develops into genuine solidarity and a vehicle for a new kind of sustainable development. We must reject the old concept of the three independent pillars – economic, social and environmental – and instead recognise the interdependent nature of these elements, because they are indivisible.</p>
      <p sl="it">Determining the conditions for genuinely sustainable development requires us not only to develop new standards, such as the Beyond GDP project, but also to guarantee the active involvement of all parties at all levels of governance. It is precisely by focusing on the indivisible nature of fairness, solidarity and global governance that we can break out from behind the barrier of false freedoms and return to social models based on the individual and the common good.</p>
      <p sl="it">Rio+20 is therefore an appeal for a noble ethics and it is in such a context that both the financial and the technological proposals made by the European Parliament gain value. These span the tax on international financial transactions, support for environmental conservation projects, a broader horizon of comprehensive fiscal reform replacing taxes on labour by taxes on resource use and assessment of the impact that production of biofuels can have on food supply and biodiversity, with the focus on global assessment of impact of technology on the environment and society.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our proposals are intended to prepare the ground for an international conference that would mark a true political turning point in planning the development of our planet.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Commissioners and the Minister for their constructive contributions to this debate. I will not go back twenty years like Karl-Heinz Florenz, but rather I want to take you back 400 years when William Shakespeare wrote his famous words ‘to be or not to be’. I believe that a contemporary and more economically-oriented Shakespeare could now write ‘to be sustainable or not to be at all’. Because that is the question.</p>
      <p sl="de">The world is currently developing towards a green economy; an economy where sustainability is a key condition for being competitive. Leading companies are aware of this and are investing in that vision, but unfortunately most companies still consider sustainability as something which costs a lot of money.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, Rio+20 comes at the right moment. It is a huge opportunity to show the world that being efficient with resources, emitting less and investing in green technology does pay off. Let Rio+20 be a worldwide wake-up call and not only involve the business community but let them commit themselves to the objectives of the green economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">But that is the ‘green economy’ side of the Summit; what about the other top issue: a constitutional framework, governance, or politicians? Are they working along these same lines? No. Just watch the presidential debates in the US for five minutes, and it is rather painful to see how science is put aside for short-term political reasons.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am afraid that governments speaking in quite general terms do not deliver on what they agree to do in international agreements, but is a clean environment and the conservation of species not a universal right just like human rights? Of course it is; that is why I strongly endorse the establishment of an international environmental court. It sends a clear message out into the world that environmental issues are trans-boundary and should be dealt with as such.</p>
      <p sl="de">Shakespeare’s Hamlet is not particularly known for its happy end, but if we are ambitious for Rio+20 the contemporary Shakespeare I started with will have the opportunity to find a happy end in his new play.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I say how happy I am to see you in the chair; it is the first time I have had the pleasure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Marking 20 years since the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, this is a timely opportunity to assess our approach to international dialogues on the environment and development. We need to ask ourselves if we are moving in the right direction. Rather than producing a wish list of outcomes based on the triumph of hope over experience, we need to accept the pace of development and find ways of mitigating its effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to resist the temptation to grandstand on the bigger issues today and confine myself to talking about the resolution which we have in front of us, because there are a number of blind alleys that we can stray down. Firstly, nuclear energy. The Fukushima tragedy must not be used as a modern-day Trojan horse to push the anti-nuclear rhetorical agenda. Nuclear energy is an essential part of the energy mix. Yes, let us insist that future facilities are not situated in areas of seismic activity, but this is not an excuse for asking for a ban.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to mention GMOs. To suggest that they are not sustainable development is disproportionate. I am fully aware of the various arguments put forward by anti-GMO lobbies and pro. I know there are very strong feelings in Member States, but there are currently GMO crops authorised for use in the European Union, and it would be entirely wrong to label them as unsustainable and to promote organic agriculture only in this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the call for a financial transaction tax. We hear it almost every day; we heard it again this morning from the President of the Commission. It is fast becoming the panacea for all our woes. This is not realistic. With the current economic conditions, we need to think much more carefully. I welcome the Commissioner’s outline and look forward to more detail on that subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a non-legislative resolution. If it is read by the UN, it will merely serve to send out mixed signals ahead of our Member States’ negotiations. Let us resist the temptation to unnecessarily politicise, stick to a script we can all subscribe to, and get on with making a real difference.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the context in which preparations are taking place for the fourth Earth Summit is difficult. It is incumbent upon us, of course, to tackle the financial and economic crisis in the euro area. However, one crisis does not chase away another and they are often linked. Indeed, the debt crisis does not affect only Greece and European finances. The crisis is not just financial. It is also a social and ecological crisis, which has to be brought to an end.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we are running an ecological deficit. We began to eat into our credit forty years ago and the debt has been growing ever since. Inequalities are getting worse, assaults on mother nature are mounting every year, with imbalances in the weather system, deforestation, collapsing fish stocks and loss of biodiversity being the most flagrant signs. There is only one solution for humanity: it must settle its debt. For this to happen, it behoves the policy makers of this world to act in solidarity, now, in 2012, not in 10 years’ time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the European Union has a crucial role to play and that the fourth Earth Summit in Rio in June 2012 is the ideal framework for making further commitments, for changing our economic development models, and for moving towards a new green economy. Let us say ‘yes’ to an economy that consumes fewer resources, a fairer economy, an economy that is committed to ecological sustainability and social justice; ‘yes’ to new indicators going beyond GDP; ‘yes’ to the principle of bioconditionality; but ‘no’ to the commoditisation and privatisation of common assets; and ‘no’ to the reproduction of the models that have brought us to where we are today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us say ‘yes’ to an international status for environmental refugees; ‘yes to greater responsibility, justice and environmental democracy. We, elected representatives, 20 years later, what do we say to Severn Suzuki? What will our response be if another child stands up in Rio in June 2012 and expresses her fear of the future, her inability to understand the inequalities that exist across the world and implores us to act before it is too late?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The resolution we will vote on tomorrow is one of the elements of that response. This resolution, as adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is an ambitious, firm and responsible position, and I call on my fellow Members not to weaken it. I call on the Commission and the Council to give it the scope it deserves at the highest level for sustainable development on a global scale.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development represents a continuation of previous global summits and revisits the subject matter of the UN Millennium Summit held in 2000 and, in this instance, the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that a sustainable economy is an opportunity for growth for European businesses, on the condition that the objectives are both realistic and achievable, and avoid an unjustified increase in the cost of production, which would expose them to competition from countries that are not subject to the same restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is crucial that the European Union implements an effective international strategy to ensure that European environmental regulations, which are currently among the strictest in the world, are also adopted by third countries by means of comparable binding commitments. This goal is an absolute priority so that we can secure a level playing field for European businesses, allowing them to remain in the market and be competitive on a global level.</p>
      <p sl="it">With this objective in mind, we consider that the main lever on which to insist with a wider strategic approach is the strengthening of international partnerships for the promotion and dissemination of sustainable low-environmental-impact technologies in emerging nations and developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is absolutely essential if we do not arrive at a comprehensive agreement that Europe does not and must not make unilateral commitments, or we risk the failure of our business model. A means of applying pressure on third countries that are unwilling to commit themselves to an environmentally friendly future is to impose import duties in proportion to the assessed economic benefit these countries derive from their want of commitment.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Rio+20 resolution is ambitious with regard to sustainable development and, perhaps, the most important point to note is the way it distances itself from nuclear energy. It is essential that Parliament now speaks out against this ticking time bomb. The question is not whether or not nuclear energy will obliterate the world, but rather when . We saw fresh evidence of that at the beginning of this year during the terrible disaster in Fukushima and, less than a fortnight ago, much closer to home, in France. Many members were shocked by this and I hope that they will vote in favour of the resolution tomorrow. Energy demand is high, but destroying the environment and social stability with nuclear power is definitely not the solution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, the Rio resolution calls for the scale of deforestation to be reduced, particularly in Latin America. I have a comment on that. We in Europe ought to take action first before we can blame Brazil and neighbouring countries for destroying rainforests. The rainforests are largely being felled in order to grow soya for the European market. Europe is partly responsible for massive deforestation in Latin America and has to curb the importation of this ‘rainforest soya’. Otherwise, we will not be able to take Brazil and the neighbouring countries to task next year on the destruction of their rainforests.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The resolution also speaks out against GMOs and I welcome that wholeheartedly. However, earlier this year, Europe itself failed to introduce a total ban on GMOs. The message that a better environment begins at home applies here just as it applies in the case of rainforests.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, let me turn to water management. Clean drinking water is a human right. Drinking water supplies should remain in public hands. I hope that we, as representatives of the people, will reaffirm that tomorrow. I am confident that the European Parliament will reaffirm the ambitions of the Rio resolution tomorrow and I ask the same of the Council and the Commission.</p>

Workers were contaminated and there were some terrible accidents. Let us not pretend that nothing is wrong. Nuclear power comes with extremely high risks, as we have seen in Japan. This leads to social and environmental instability. We must put a stop to that. There are plenty of other sustainable solutions which do not generate nuclear waste and which we in Europe could make greater use of. However, we have to start doing that here, so that we can demonstrate the credibility of our intentions to other countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for some years now climate realists like me have struggled to understand what lies behind the man-made global warming hoax which will be further exploited at Rio+20.</p>
      <p sl="en">Various theories have been put forward. Post-1989, it gave the far left a new stick with which to beat the West. Maurice Strong and the United Nations saw it as a way of promoting one-world government. It has handed carbon traders and wind factory profiteers a taxpayer-funded blank cheque. But none of the above explains the hitherto puzzling role of big oil and neo-con foundations in funding the environmentalist protest groups which have led the climate-change and anti-nuclear propaganda offensives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, however, their real agenda is coming to light. Phoney green hysteria has blocked the potential for nuclear and coal electricity to power our civilisation in the post-peak oil world. This gap allows those who will profit from gas fracking to say that we have no choice but to exploit this environmentally disastrous energy source. Of course we have no choice, because their useful idiot Greens have denied us the other alternatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">So now we face a fracking gold rush in, among other targets, Lancashire, Wales, southern England, France and Poland, where George Soros has just won an almost exclusive licence to loot and pollute almost the entire country. The neo-cons and globalists are also excited about the potential of fracked gas to advance their geopolitical agenda of reducing the influence of Russia and destabilising the Arab world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that the document that we have tabled is very balanced. However, I would also like to express my disappointment that apparently we are conducting a nuclear debate here. The problem facing the world is not whether or not to have nuclear power. Let us address the real problems and not spend time discussing whether or not we need nuclear power.</p>
      <p sl="de">One real problem is water. The Earth may indeed be 70% covered with water – after all, it is known as the blue planet – but only 3% of that is effectively available as fresh water. To illustrate this, let us say that this part of Parliament here is the land mass, and the rest here is the oceans – but only one row of seats here consists of the fresh water that people are competing for.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that today one billion people are already without water. It is also a fact that water consumption is increasing at twice the rate of the world’s population. That is one of the biggest challenges that we face.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above all, let us not forget that at present water requirements are mainly taken from fossil reserves. This means that if these reserves do not keep being replenished they will be lost. To give you an example: in Beijing the water table is dropping by half a metre a day. I believe that this in fact shows very clearly how great the pressure on these reserves is.</p>
      <p sl="de">We really need to come up with some answers here, and these answers must be on both supply and demand sides. On the demand side, agriculture faces a major challenge. Worldwide it currently consumes around 93% of the available water, but around 50% of this available water is simply lost through pipelines, conduits and evaporation. We need to do something about this using modern technology. Likewise, daily consumption: a sustainable level would be around 25 litres of water per day, such as is consumed in South Africa. In Europe our consumption is around ten times that level. We should therefore give consideration to what we can do about this too.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need to take action on the supply side, however. In other words, we need to think about how we can use modern technology to make water available. Let us work together on this – and please can we concentrate on the real problems, not on the issue of whether or not to have nuclear power.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, twenty years ago, we emerged from the Earth Summit in Rio with a great deal of hope. However, twenty years on, we will be making a less hopeful journey to the next Rio summit. The question, therefore, is how can we revive that hope, the hope that prosperity is possible despite the increasing scarcity of resources and ecosystems being put under pressure? You and Mr Potočnik have put forward various proposals in that regard. The problem, though, is how do you achieve any concrete results at a global level?</p>
      <p sl="nl">We all have great visions and fine plans and you have put in a really good cross. Only, the question is: which specific targets do you want to achieve in Rio? A new body? A new scheme - internalising external costs, as it is called, that is including environmental and social costs in the price of products? Next, how are you going to arrange for all of that? Will the WTO and G20 also be at the negotiating table?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Water is obviously a very serious problem and we need to forge appropriate agreements. Only, how precisely are you going to work out what needs doing, because water does not lend itself to easy transportation across the world. Indeed, the use of water across the world is a very important topic, but are we going to get stuck in discussing this or are there going to be any specific measures?</p>
      <p sl="nl">On the Rio+20 website, all kinds of organisations are making wonderful recommendations about what we all could do or what the world leaders ought to do. What is the Commission going to do about that and how do we come up with a single platform? I would like to end with a quote used by one of the speakers.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as indicated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the concept of a green economy is complementary to the concept of sustainable development. It is not intended to replace it. By means of this resolution, we wish to make it clear that it is about finally placing the economy at the service of sustainable development and not about delegating the management of the ecological crisis to multinationals and financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is no longer possible simply to call for the development of new market mechanisms and new technologies. Monitoring and the transition to a green economy will necessarily take account of external factors and new approaches to economic performance. New indicators, used in addition to GDP figures, for measuring the progress of societies, following the work of the Commission chaired by Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, must therefore be discussed in Rio.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With a view to better governance, the UNEP must be given full status within the United Nations. The World Environment Organisation, which we have been talking about for too long, must finally be created. An international criminal court, set up to deal with serious environmental crime, must be attached to it. Civil society must also be fully associated. From this perspective, the Committee on World Food Security serves as a very good model of governance. One of the key demands of civil society will be that Rio+20 should result in a mandate for negotiations to draw up an international convention on the evaluation of the relevant technologies. That, in my view, is a crucial point, and I call on the Council to mention it in its conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, different technologies have different social, economic, and even geopolitical, as well as environmental, consequences, which need to be assessed. Are we going to allow powerful technologies such as synthetic biology and geo-engineering to develop without any control? Such a convention on the evaluation of the relevant technologies would be in complete conformity with European practices and laws. This is a matter of great urgency. It is more than time that we progressed to the stage of decision making and implementation.</p>

      <p sl="nl">… all kinds of topics are being included on the agenda. For today, I will pick out one specific one: overfishing. This one has gone in totally the wrong direction. At the moment, around eighty per cent of all fish stocks are being overfished, as a result of which all sorts of fish are at risk of extinction. In my opinion, we need to forge agreements when it comes to the world’s oceans, because we are all fishing from the same pond. Those agreements have to be about sustainable fisheries management, that is to say, about ensuring that fish stocks can remain at a stable level and that we use fishing techniques which spare the seabed and reduce bycatch. Many people work in the fishing industry and, for around a quarter of the world’s population, fish is the most important source of food. Therefore, Mr President, I will not quote anyone else but myself: if we fail to turn the tide in Rio, the damage will be irreparable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Rio +20 Earth Summit 2012 sounds important – but is it really? The Socialist one-world agenda has been having a hard time of it of late. Global problems require global solutions: sounds good. But global governance through scare stories about man-made global warming has fallen flat. People in the UK, US and China are hugely disbelieving. Everybody knows that CO2 is not the cause of the ice ages coming and going. So how can a little extra CO2 be a problem now, whether or not it causes a little extra global warning? Is not a little warming a good thing?

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, since the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, the concept of sustainable development has become integrated, a little more each day, into the habits of the people inhabiting this planet, including those of our European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say how much I agree with Mr Kraszewski and with Mr Bennahmias. Yes, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) must be strengthened by a UN agency, or a World Environment Organisation should even be created with real powers to act. In the interim, I welcome the ambition of the European Union, driven by this Parliament, to play a leadership role in future discussions, including those scheduled for June 2012 in Rio.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore endorse the broad thrust of the resolution drawn up by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I would like to thank Mr Florenz for his forbearance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, one point in particular concerns me. As you know, Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states quite clearly that the choice of energy mix is a national and purely a national matter. There are some Members of Parliament who, apparently, attach no value to the Treaty and would like the European Union to ask, suddenly, the entire world to abandon nuclear power, knowing that some countries in the European Union are producers, and other countries are large consumers, of nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will only be credible if our prospects are realistic. If Parliament embarks on this path and prepares to send this type of message to the entire world, I will not, unfortunately, be able to vote in favour of the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nuclear energy contributes directly to sustainable development, as it is one of the sources of energy that emit the lowest amount of CO2 . It is therefore clear to me that the response to Fukushima must be to ensure an optimal level of nuclear safety and to promote that requirement at international level. What we need are higher safety standards which are better controlled and implemented in a fully transparent manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioners and the Minister speaking on behalf of the Polish Council for their contributions, and I would also like to thank Mr Leinen who is the author of this resolution. Now I shall speak in my mother tongue, Romanian.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that this is a resolution which expresses a strong stance from the European Parliament and must be put to good use. We are all, of course, committed to sustainable development and the measures for guaranteeing not only present generations, but future generations as well, a safe and fair future. I believe that we must focus on providing proper and fair access to natural resources because this is a prerequisite not only for sustainable development and eradicating poverty, but for protecting the environment as well. The concept of a green economy, as was also mentioned by Mr Kraszewski, is one which must be considered globally. Indeed, the European Union must maintain its leading role in assuming and keeping its international commitments, especially on climate change, while highlighting the potential offered by investments in new technologies, clean industries and clean technologies as a driving force for sustainable economic growth, job creation and environmental protection. Social dialogue is also a prerequisite for ensuring sustainable development.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we must take great care that we adopt a strategy for greening of the economy that supports policies that in fact achieve those objectives, and not policies that achieve the exact opposite.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Scotland right now we have set targets of 100% energy from renewables by 2020. The Scottish Government has stated that it will not allow new nuclear power stations to be built, but rather it will race ahead with a mad dash for renewables based mainly around onshore and offshore wind, tidal and wave energy. But these projects are being funded by a sea of subsidies paid by the poor beleaguered consumers. What we are witnessing is a dramatic transfer of money from the poor to the rich and from the consumers to the wealthy estate owners and power companies. Scotland’s consumers have recently seen their bills go up by between 10% and 20%. In July the Department of Energy in Whitehall revealed that rising bills have pushed 5.5 million households into fuel poverty. That is one-fifth of British homes. The most vulnerable people in society will be forced to make the choice between food or fuel.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a scandal of unparalleled proportions, but it is one of the unintended consequences of pursuing a policy of greening the economy, which is in fact driving people into poverty rather than eradicating it. Nor can such a policy be described as sustainable when wind turbines only provide energy for around 22% of their working life. They do not work when there is no wind and they have to be switched off when there is too much wind. So every megawatt of installed wind capacity has to be backed up with a megawatt of installed baseload which, in the case of Scotland where no nuclear power will be allowed in the future, means a heavy reliance on high CO2 -emitting gas or coal plants. A green economy is worth striving for, but not at any cost.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, twenty years on from the last sustainability summit in Rio de Janeiro, we have not actually made very much progress. Biodiversity is still declining throughout the world. Greenhouse gas levels are increasing. The oceans are being depleted more and more. Desertification is increasing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Does that make our economy so much better? The current economic crisis is showing us the consequences of the financial bubble on which we have built our economy. Rio de Janeiro therefore means that we have to change both our economic and environmental course. As is often the case, we all agree with each other here in this Chamber. Minister Kraszewski wants a greener economy, Commissioner Hedegaard, Commissioner Potočnik, they are all in favour of that greener economy. However, if we want to be credible, then we really ought to put this in place ourselves and set an example. Where is Poland in terms of an ambitious climate agenda? We hear nothing coming from Poland about the green economy. In terms of our agricultural policy, when will we see the real greening? In terms of our fisheries policy, are we really going to address depletion? When we talk about Rio de Janeiro, we, as Europe, really ought to lead by example.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, some twenty years have gone by since the first UN conference on the environment which is a long enough timeframe to allow us properly to judge what we have done towards environmentally sustainable life on Earth. It has also given us ample time to show that we are qualified to set new tasks and objectives for the years to come.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The forthcoming United Nations Rio+20 conference on sustainable development will focus on two main issues. The first will be greening the economy in the context of sustainable development and fighting poverty, and the second will be institutional development within the framework of sustainable development. This conference could be a major stimulus for moving towards a world-wide green economy. We must, however, make the effort to ensure we have prepared effective mechanisms to implement its resolutions in everyday life. To secure the vision and goals of the summit we will have to prepare a sound plan for greening the economy which defines the scope of international, regional and national steps and measures, with measurable indicators and targets for progress. We should use the time that remains until the Rio+20 Earth Summit in June 2012 to prepare such a plan, for example, a road map to a green economy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to invite Mr Eickhout to Poland, because I have lived there for several decades and have not seen rivers drying up, and as for CO2 emissions, Poland has reduced them under the Kyoto Protocol by about 30%, something which no country in Western Europe has achieved.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Rio+20 is a great challenge and an opportunity to develop supranational measures to ensure sustainable development while also meeting the needs of society and the environment. The three Rio Conventions on Biodiversity, Climate Change and Desertification are a response to a number of related problems. They are well-known and have been widely discussed in the forum of the European Union. The Rio+20 summit should primarily be a stimulus to developing a coordinated approach to the three conventions, and the Union should be a leader in talks on a coherent strategy. The outcome of the summit should be specific action which will provide a stimulus to aid development of the green economy, including, for example, plans on the costs of environment protection arising from economic decisions and the establishment of effective mechanisms and programmes adapted to global challenges which will meet the needs both of developed and developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Rio conference should not be used to further particular party, political or ideological interests. I am thinking here, for example, of information which has emerged recently about attempts to prevent the use of nuclear energy or shale gas, which is currently known enigmatically as an unconventional fuel. The energy mix, as Ms Auconie said, is a matter for the Member States. Only consensus and a judicious compromise will allow us to combine the Rio+20 objectives with the necessity of sustainable access to a variety of energy sources.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Rio+20 is an opportunity to set the planet on a sustainable path, to go into the mechanics of the details and how we are going to do it. We speak a lot in this Parliament, but the main task is to vote tomorrow on the resolution. I would like to mention some points about some split votes and separate votes that have been proposed by the EPP.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know most of my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment from the EPP and I wonder how the EPP can ask for the deletion of the need to integrate biodiversity into the national accounts. This is one of the basic reasons for us going to Rio+20. How can you ask to delete our concern about the Brazilian Government’s new forest code? It is very well known that this will not allow the Brazilian Government to meet its obligations on deforestation. How can you delete the concerns about offshore oil exploration in environmentally fragile areas, or be against access to adequate and healthy food as a basic human right, or oppose the measures against speculation on the price of basic food that leads to food crises around the world? I am sure that this was a mistake and I hope you will fix that.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we do, naturally, agree that development should be as sustainable as possible. This resolution, however, is about something else. Under the pretext of making global development sustainable, the authors are proposing measures which are either inadequate or positively harmful. What does sustainable development have to do with introducing a tax on financial transactions? I would like to remind everyone that this morning Mr Barroso already managed to spend the money collected from this tax, except that he spent it on measures for fighting the financial crisis, so it will be very difficult to spend the money again, this time on climate policy. I would also like to remind you that linking a tax to specific expenditure is at variance with the principle of the universality of taxation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The ban on the production of unconventional oil, which concerns a tiny part of the territory of Canada and the United States, has nothing to do with sustainable development. Similarly, reducing the use or even a global end to the use of nuclear energy has nothing to do with sustainable development. Inclusion of these matters in this highly overestimated resolution means only one thing – the European Union will not have a united position for the conference in Rio.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The resolution also contains recipes which can produce simply catastrophic results, in particular for the poorest part of the world’s population. I am thinking of the proposal to abandon, once again on a global scale, the use of fossil fuels and to replace them with renewable energy sources. Even in Europe, the wealthiest societies are not in a position to bear the costs of this change and are complaining about the high costs. How are these costs to be borne by societies which live on the edge of poverty? Who will pay for the construction of new networks, for the installations which will make up the shortfalls in energy supplies, or for the new installations themselves? The resolution in this form is not suitable for adoption, but if it is adopted, it will only have a harmful effect on coordination of European policy before the world summit in Rio.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, we are talking about sustainable development and international negotiations and, since joining Parliament, I have noticed that these topics tend to put members in a dilemma. They present them with two options: the first is to focus on the issue at hand and try to resolve it, the second is to exploit the issue for political reasons.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The former presents a risk: it involves working hard to reach an uncertain result with the public probably learning little or nothing about this work. This is bad for our political careers. If we go for the latter option, on the other hand, we are forced to speak only of polemical home issues, regardless of how little they pertain to international negotiations. However, this ensures media interest, which is good for our political careers.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I am in favour of us focusing on resolving problems. However, this also means that our resolution should be shorter and more focused. It should encompass the global context without including superfluous home affairs. The paragraph on nuclear energy is erroneous and offers no solutions. What would we achieve by adopting it? No country would abolish nuclear energy just because the European Parliament had called for this.</p>
      <p sl="sl">If we want to do good, we must ensure a healthy environment and safety for the people. As far as nuclear energy is concerned, we can help this cause by insisting on the highest nuclear safety standards possible and international harmonisation of these standards. This is a realistic possibility and the kind of action that the Union should commit to. It also very much has to do with the quality of life of people within and without the Union’s borders.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We face the threat of climate change and nuclear energy is a source of energy that produces electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. The energy industry represents an important part of the transition to a green economy and I, personally, support the development of sustainable sources of energy and a strong focus on energy efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In Europe there are 80 million people at risk of poverty, which makes this resolution important.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Rio+20 Conference offers us an important opportunity to discuss global challenges such as the effective use of resources, sustainability and food security. I wish to highlight two important issues in light of tomorrow’s resolution. The first one concerns agriculture. In Romania 30% of the population work in the agricultural sector. Farming is the only source of income for millions of people, and the only major support for subsistence. Most of them own small holdings. This is just the same as in other Member States and in other countries outside the European Union. Small farms which have a low impact on the environment and offer food security to millions of people need to be supported and promoted. The second issue I wish to highlight is to do with the marine environment. This is a source we use jointly. This is why it needs to be managed efficiently at a global level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are all united in the very strong conviction that joint action to fight climate change is essential, and we have to work together to develop an action plan for sustainable development for the next 10 years and a better, more effective plan than we currently have for fighting poverty. It is essential that for this purpose we draft a global agreement, because at present we are in a very difficult situation. We are forcing our citizens and our businesses to accept changes which are very difficult for them, while other countries around the world are not bound by the same rules. How are we to explain to our citizens and businesses that they have to comply, while others do not? In Europe, we have our 2020 objectives, we have a legal system with the Court of Justice of the European Union and fixed standards, but these measures are not in use in the United States, India or China. How are we to persuade people that we need to close down coal-fired power stations when they know that 10 new power stations of this kind are currently being built in China? It is very hard to tell them that energy prices are to go up and jobs to go abroad. In India we very often hear that Europe just wants to use the climate agreement to stifle newly-emerging economic powers and reduce their ability to compete.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We certainly are able to do more than we are doing now, but these commitments must not apply to just one continent. Since the only fair way to strengthen the action we take is to make a joint agreement, it seems to me we must also look for a plan B and a plan C, in other words plans which will tell us what we are to do if we do not manage to reach that global agreement.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We often hear the phrase ‘think globally, act locally’, but perhaps that slogan should be reversed a little – we are told we must act and think globally, and only later think about how things should be in our own backyard, but perhaps, in fact, we should start slowly from our own backyard and take things on from there.</p>

We need to establish an economy that is capable of ensuring growth and development while creating jobs and reducing inequalities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A green economy that incorporates the application of low-carbon and resource-efficient solutions could be such an economy. However, its implementation requires us to ensure several market and regulatory conditions. Since we intend to increasingly reduce our carbon dioxide emissions I disagree with the complete exclusion of nuclear energy from our energy strategy and firmly support the omission of point 46. For the time being we have no other alternative to generate large amounts of energy at zero emissions. I believe that the Rio+20 summit will be a key opportunity to promote sustainable development.

I think that political decisions made on Europe’s energy mix must take into account the development of new low-carbon technologies in order to avoid forcing the implementation of support schemes which may distort the energy market and push up the price of electricity.

      <p sl="en">As I have heard this debate, there is clearly a very strong resonance with our Communication and the position we are developing in the Commission with the Council, so thank you for that. We are looking forward to continued cooperation on the very long way to achieve what we want in Rio. We must work together now to get a strong EU position for our input into the UN system which should harness and express our common ambitions for Rio, and I think we are well on track to meet that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will make a few comments on everything that has been said. First, Mrs Merkies said we need specific goals. The Commission very much agrees with that. That is why we will try to come up with tangible proposals for specific goals when it comes to water, energy, the oceans, sustainable agriculture and forestry. We will really try to make very tangible proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other question from Mrs Merkies was how we are going to do it. There, I think we have something to offer in the European Union, because we have very good examples that pricing works and we have very good examples that setting targets works. I would also say that with the Millennium Development Goals, although they are not perfect, the world has seen that setting such goals helps to keep a lot of governments focused on what they need to deliver: access to water, access to education and so on. They have not been perfect and they have not been fully fulfilled, but the world has basically moved in the right direction, so that is why we should continue along this way. When the Millennium Development Goals were set, it was in a world that did not speak too much of environmental goals and not too much of energy goals and that is why we need to get that into the Rio+20.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Stevenson was in favour of moving to a green economy provided that it cost nothing. This is not doable. It is true that to make the transformation into a green economy will demand investments. I think that it is very important to emphasise that to continue business as usual also comes at a very high price. We heard some of it here today: the depletion of fishing stocks, for instance, forestry, nature or raw materials. It is a misunderstanding in the debate that if we simply continued business as usual then it would cost us nothing. What we are talking about is whether we want to invest in business as usual – and then clean up afterwards and pay the very high price – or we want to choose a wiser development strategy and get the growth we need for the nine billion that have been mentioned many times. As long as we still have this choice, I think it is very important that the European Union is trying to push the world in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">That leads me to my third and last point. I agree with Mr Gerbrandy who spoke about the issue of whether to be sustainable or not. But then the question of course is whether the EU should then influence these kinds of global conferences, and I understood that the answer from Mr Clark would be no. I must say I disagree strongly. I think that we have a very fine track record in Europe over many years, that we can actually try to push the world in a better direction by our very strong involvement. I think we should try to do that also for Rio+20.</p>
      <p sl="en">The world is at a very important crossroads and I think the world would be poorer if we were not investing our energy and our policies in trying to use influence here. That is what we should do, and I look forward very much to working with Mr Leinen and the rest of Parliament to get a strong and united EU position on our way to Rio – hopefully to achieve not just a lot of words and fine declarations, but things and recommendations that can lead to immediate action moving the world into a more sustainable place.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Ms Hedegaard, honourable Members, what do we know 20 years after Rio? We know a great deal more. There have been many advances in science, and thanks to the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for example, we have a much better understanding of the effects of human activity on the environment. This should be a lesson for us, and it should make us realise that we do not have time – we do not have much time left. Research is ongoing, and it is not unlikely that we will find we have reached the point known as ‘peak oil’. What will happen now if China, India or other countries which are on the fast track to development repeat the logic of Japan’s or Korea’s development, for example? This problem – which by the way involves a degree of fear that the planet will not be able to provide our grandchildren with what they need to live – this, honourable Members, is not our grandchildren’s problem, it is our problem. Therefore it is extremely important to escape the logic of exponential development, which expects that with each successive year development will be faster than the last one, and that next year it will be faster still. At the moment that is the way things are, and at the moment that is how people think.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a great role here for the European Union. The European Union has often shown that it has a role as a leader, and we are currently also making enormous efforts, and Ms Hedegaard and I in my capacity as a representative of the Polish Presidency are both well aware of the difficulties we encounter when we talk to the greatest emitters and try to persuade them to adjust their pace to that of the European Union. We must not stop at this. Rio must be the next step, our latest response to threats which are becoming a reality. It is important that we treat the green economy seriously. The green economy is not something which can be allowed to cause poverty to increase – quite the opposite. The green economy should be managed to allow the creation of new jobs and to ensure our prosperity – to fulfil our aspirations and also to give us work. So it is a certain kind of game, a fairly sophisticated kind of game, and one which we have to learn to play.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to say a word about technology. We still do not know everything about the technology. Not all the technology is available to us to allow us to say with full certainty that we will only use renewable sources of energy, for example, and nothing else. However, if technologies for storing energy develop – if I can at least mention this now – perhaps that beautiful, ideal world we would like to have will be possible in a few decades – 20, 30 or 40 years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Once again, I would like to emphasise how pleased I am, as a representative of the Polish Presidency, to be able to be a part, too, of what we call the European Union’s leadership. Having listened to Mr Florenz, and having listened to Mr Leinen, I feel sure that the European Parliament, together with the Council and together with the European Commission, will provide that leadership, and that we will be able to say that the matters of sustainable development dealt with at this important conference in Rio represent real progress. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Rio+20 Summit scheduled for June 2012 offers a unique occasion for world leaders to set the agenda for sustainability for the next 10 years and to reaffirm the need for global solidarity. It would send an important message if the participating states were to be represented by their head of state or government.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The green economy and private sector must not lead to populist, economically unsustainable decisions being made. Sustainable development must become a priority at EU level as part of all EU processes and policies, if the Union wants to show consistency both internally and globally. The Rio+20 Summit is an extremely important occasion for reinforcing the partnership between industrialised and developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, there is one item which I disagree with, which is the intention to ban the use of nuclear power to produce energy. Closing down nuclear power plants would hamper the economy and life in society. Consequently, I believe that the response to this kind of challenge is to tighten safety measures. I would therefore have liked the European Parliament to have granted the European Commission, as part of the Rio Summit negotiations, a mandate inspired by this idea.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I support the proposals of the resolution on the UN conference on sustainable development, but I would like to point out that the paragraph referring to the total removal of nuclear energy from Europe’s energy mix goes against the interests of certain Member States, including Romania for one.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that nuclear energy is vital, at least in the medium term, with a view to providing end consumers with affordable electricity. This is also a low-carbon technology which can make a significant contribution to achieving the EU’s climate change targets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Hasty political decisions about energy production, made under pressure from public opinion and in an unsuitable emotional frame of mind, can have serious consequences. They can affect energy supply security, lead to a rise in fossil fuel prices and even jeopardise the EU’s energy independence.</p>
      <p sl="ro">New energy technologies must be developed and the energy market operated for the benefit and not to the detriment of the consumer. We must provide a steady flow of affordable energy. This is why these aspects must be examined properly before any decisions are made, such as the one about the role of nuclear energy in Europe’s energy mix.</p>

      <p sl="fr">First of all, I am firmly opposed to paragraph 46 providing for the closure of nuclear power stations and prohibiting the construction of new infrastructure. We must not be taken in by the scaremongering triggered by recent events. We must, of course, ensure that all nuclear power stations comply with very strict safety standards. That is my primary concern. Be that as it may, this paragraph is irresponsible. Nuclear energy represents a significant proportion of our energy resources: 78% of electricity is generated by nuclear power. Nuclear power guarantees energy independence and stability of supply. Furthermore, nuclear energy is the cleanest and most reliable form of energy. We cannot currently do without it. Moreover, this resolution is disproportionate. While we do indeed need to protect the environment, we must also be realistic and not penalise our economies by placing excessive ecological demands on them. This resolution calls this delicate balance into question and goes beyond measures necessary to protect the environment. I therefore intend to abstain in the vote on this report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In spite of Article 194 of the Treaty, which gives Member States the right to set conditions for the exploitation of their energy resources, the right to choose between various energy sources and to establish a basic mix of energy supply, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has managed to insert a point 46 into the draft resolution on drawing up a common EU negotiating position for the Rio+20 UN conference on sustainable development, the second part of which calls for the decommissioning of existing nuclear power plants and a halt to the construction of new nuclear plants. A proposal such as this is unacceptable, and not only for the Czech Republic, which is and will continue to be highly dependent on nuclear energy. Other Member States are also counting on the exploitation of nuclear energy, and any form of restriction would mean greater dependency on fossil fuels, and growing emissions of greenhouse gases. If Europe is to meet its binding targets in the area of climate change, we must make use of all the available options for obtaining energy, including nuclear. There are risks connected with many other branches of industry, and despite that we do not prohibit the extraction of oil or the production of chemicals. Instead of this, there is an attempt to ensure by all means available the highest standards of safety and environmental protection. Rational discussion in the area of nuclear power should focus mainly on ensuring maximum safety and on the management of radioactive waste and spent fuel.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the situation of the refugees stranded in North Africa is of course an issue of major concern. When the crisis began, the Commission immediately called for a meeting between Member States, the Commission, the IOM and the UNHCR to discuss the situation of the refugees stranded in Libya and to get an assessment of the resettlement needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the European Union tried to evacuate – and succeeded in evacuating – thousands of people from third countries and bring them back to their countries of origin. We also called for the Member States to pledge resettlement places for refugees coming from the region. Several Member States announced their readiness to consider resettlement or to rearrange their annual quotas in order to be able to resettle urgent cases. In parallel, the Commission financed humanitarian assistance to be provided to all refugees leaving the country. That also included an evacuation process from places such as Misratah, the establishment of refugee camps and assistance with registration and reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">In May this year I organised a meeting with the Ministers, a pledging conference on resettlement of the stranded refugees. Further pledges were made. In total, EU Member States pledged 408 places for refugees from North Africa. In addition, Norway pledged 300. This is good but is clearly not enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is, as you know, not directly involved in the process of resettlement itself. That is jointly run by the UNHCR, the Member States and the IOM. The information I have on the statistics there is based on the figures I got from the UNHCR. So far, eight EU Member States have agreed to consider 374 cases submitted by the UNHCR. Of this number so far, seven Member States have accepted 303 refugees for resettlement; 155 have already departed: 25 to Belgium, 130 to Sweden.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are very aware that the need for a settlement is much greater. However, that decision rests with the Member States. What the Commission can do is quite limited. We can encourage Member States through financial support from the European Refugee Fund, particularly for the regions where there is a regional protection programme in place. As an incentive, Member States can receive EUR 4 000 from the Refugee Fund per resettled refugee coming from any of these countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Regional Protection Programme in North Africa includes Egypt, Libya and Tunisia and is run jointly with the UNHCR. At the Commission’s request, the programme has an important resettlement component financed from its EUR 3.6 million budget. This is intended to speed up the sometimes very slow process.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not yet possible to assess how many of the 3 083 of the settlement places pledged by the Member States formally within their quotas for REF funding for next year will be allocated from this region, but I hope that the urgent need in North Africa will be considered and that the Member States will use large parts of their quotas to resettle refugees from Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The regional protection programmes in North Africa were created to increase the protection space in the region. It is our long-term goal to build up an asylum capacity together with these new governments so that the improved international standards can be in place. This is also part of the mobility partnership that we are seeking with these countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the joint EU resettlement programme, there is disagreement over the procedure. I very much regret that the compromise proposals so far have not been able to gain support. The European Refugee Fund is, as you know, quite a large and complex mechanism and is run according to well-defined rules. The pledging of resettlement places must take place by June each year, and that means that any amendment to the Refugee Fund decision must be finalised very soon to ensure a smooth operation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that the Commission is working hard to develop better and more flexible ways to fund EU resettlement, and that will be part of the post-2013 financial instrument. We hope that increased funding, combined with new flexible rules, will result in more resettlement from EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ladies and gentlemen, this year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention. During the commemoration in Geneva in December this year, state commitments will, hopefully, be made. The UNHCR has expressed hope that the EU Member States will come forward with new resettlement pledges, and we will continue to call on the Commission to resettle the most vulnerable refugees from North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Today, before this Parliament, I would like to ask you to join us in urging the Member States to do more and to show solidarity with those countries where there are people in extreme need of help and resettlement. Together maybe we can achieve something so that new commitments could be made. This would be a true commitment for solidarity and responsibility, sharing and also showing European Union values at their best.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, on my initiative, between 13 July 2011 and 16 July 2011 a delegation from the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs went to Tunisia, specifically to the refugee camps on its border with Libya and the camp at Sousse. There are 4 500 people from Darfur, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Palestine and Iraq living in inhumane conditions and suffering an extreme temperature of 50 degrees centigrade.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is sickness and violence; the camp has burned down three times; and there is a lack of hygiene and drinking water. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières and other organisations are doing a tremendous job.</p>
      <p sl="es">Tunisia has shown solidarity with displaced persons and refugees from Libya. Tunisians have welcomed 90 000 Libyans into their own homes. However, beyond this emergency nobody is taking care of those in Sousse.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a major difference between the Europe that donates and the Europe that does not receive. Our solidarity extends to other countries, but we do not show solidarity within our borders.</p>
      <p sl="es">We now need to make an impassioned plea for resettlement, so that the 4 000 refugees can be received on European soil. This is neither complicated nor expensive. There has been a show of commitment, as the Commissioner said, but there needs to be something more than good will and statements of intent.</p>
      <p sl="es">We urgently need to resettle those groups who are suffering so much hardship in Sousse and who, in Europe, could find hope for their shattered lives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Many times and in desperate voices they asked Europe not to abandon them. Others told us their child had lost 10 kilos and was malnourished and in need of medical attention, but they had nowhere to go.</p>
      <p sl="es">Resettlement offers have so far totalled – or would total, if they were carried out – 718, but that still leaves 3 707 people. Madam President, I strongly call on the Council and the Commission to show commitment in order to end this serious humanitarian crisis as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we will of course join with the Commissioner in urging Member States to do more. As Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra has said for those of us on the delegation – and a few of us are now in the Chamber – there were some harrowing sights in the refugee camps, and it is worth putting that on record. On a daily basis, children, women and men face extreme heat, sandstorms, limited access to clean water, inadequate sanitation and hygiene facilities. Of course this is the story of all refugee camps in extreme areas, but I think all of our colleagues would agree that what we also saw was extreme generosity by the Tunisian people, by the army. These are people of whom many are living on the poverty line, yet they took refugees into their own homes and we witnessed this story.</p>
      <p sl="en">What it means for us is a contrast between that and a more urgent situation today. I spoke to the UNHCR last week and it has identified 5 291 persons in extreme positions who could be resettled. They have been checked. They can be resettled. We are in a situation where we know the figures, we have done the organisation and of course the Tunisian border will now be closed because of the sheer number of sub-Saharan African refugees, people who have been rejected by the rebel forces in Libya, who are now coming since our visit to the area. So there is a more urgent situation today than ever before and, with the elections also coming, the political pressures on Tunisia are extreme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since that delegation visit we ask you to redouble your efforts. We will join you in doing it. It is crucial also that the joint EU resettlement programme is established before the new multiannual financial framework. The deadlock is unblocked in Council. It would allow Member States to pledge resettlement places in May 2012, to be offered in 2013, already a long time to wait for those who are in urgent need.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has also proposed supplementary funding for any new resettlement countries and this could give the incentive that is needed to involve more Member States in resettlement. In the shorter term unblocking the resettlement programme will also allow the European Asylum Support Office to take up its role of coordinating cooperation between EU Member States and in supporting those that are new to resettlement, but the political message is very clear: resettlement does not involve huge numbers; they are very modest numbers but they are highly symbolic. I know colleagues who visited the camps will agree with me that there was one country on their lips, and that was Norway. Norway had resettled refugees, the United States had resettled refugees, Canada had resettled, and of course we in the European Union had lagged behind. We must put that right. We must get the political message right, and the humanitarian message correct.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, the first meeting of the EU-Tunisia task force, which is charged with support for the transition to democracy and economic recovery, took place today.</p>
      <p sl="it">This year, Europe’s financial commitment was doubled, and obviously I welcome this, because Tunisia, with which we have a privileged partnership, has also agreed to accept sub-Saharan refugees fleeing from the war in Libya. The European Union, which has often reaffirmed its commitment to the refugees, must without fail support and aid Tunisia to manage these migration flows while fully respecting human rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Norway, although not part of the European Union, has agreed to accommodate more than 300 refugees, while EU Member States have agreed to accommodate fewer than 400 refugees in total. I consider this to be a deplorable and shameful attitude, a real insult to the principle of solidarity that should underpin the European Union’s Mediterranean policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should remind you, what is more, that these refugees are currently confined in camps in intolerable conditions. This morning in this very Chamber the European Parliament approved by a large majority an allocation of EUR 43.9 million for managing the migrant and refugee flows arising from repression by authoritarian regimes and movements linked to the Arab Spring. These additional funds will be used to assist the Member States most affected by these flows and to reinforce marine patrols by Frontex.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let us reaffirm our assent to a Europe committed as much to the promotion of human rights as to the management of migration flows, and let us reject the idea of a fortress Europe that is xenophobic and closed. Today, the European Union is paying the price of its previous support for the dictatorial regimes of North Africa. Our former friends Gaddafi and Ben Ali have fallen or are falling and their people are fleeing repression.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to know what stage the joint EU resettlement programme, currently blocked in the Council, has reached. I am asking you, Commissioner, whom I know to be extremely sensitive and pro-active, how, in the current situation, can the European Union make a concrete commitment with regard to this humanitarian emergency?</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I am taking the opportunity of asking the Commission whether it is aware of what is happening in Palermo, where the Italian authorities are forcing 250 migrants to remain aboard a ship, without any provision authorising their detention, and denying them their right to freedom and to communicate with the outside world. Thanks to numerous reports presented to the Public Prosecutor’s Office at Palermo by many organisations in Palermo and Sicily fighting for human rights, the Palermo Public Prosecutor has just opened an investigation.</p>
      <p sl="it">This event follows some extremely serious facts that took place at Lampedusa last week, where the situation is out of control and where the safety of both the local population and that of the migrants themselves is at risk.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in Tunisia the departure of Ben Ali heralded the triumph of democracy over despotism. For the first time in generations, Tunisians have the right democratically to determine their own destiny. Under the new democratic leadership, stability has been restored in Tunis and the country is once more on the road to prosperity. Tourists have returned and international businesses are now making new investments. Therefore a clear distinction must be drawn between genuine asylum seekers and economic migrants leaving Tunisia and other North African countries, coming from further afield, who are arriving on the EU shores in very large numbers; indeed more than 40 000 since January this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is deplorable that in Lampedusa, a refugee reception centre has been razed to the ground by Tunisian refugees protesting at their imminent repatriation. The EU must have a fair but robust approach in dealing with this large influx of asylum seekers and, in my view, return – or help Tunisia return, if they are still on North African soil – individuals to their country of origin in the large majority of cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also redouble our efforts to apprehend those thuggish members of the Ben Ali, Gaddafi and Mubarak regimes, some of whom – bizarrely – may now be attempting to become bogus asylum seekers in the European Union. They should face the criminal justice system if they have blood on their hands.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Ms Malmström, we are here precisely to help you to convince various Member States of the need to resettle on the European continent these refugees in Tunisia who have nowhere to go.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I was amazed to see the whole of Europe get into a panic when 25 000 Tunisians arrived in Lampedusa, so much so that France even slammed the border shut in their face – surely, 25 000 cannot be so many people – but now we are talking about 5 000 people. This therefore concerns even fewer people. Contrary to what Mr Tannock just said, these are people who cannot return home, Somalis, Eritreans, Sudanese and some from a few other difficult countries in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There was a young man and a girl I met there, in that camp in Shousha. He was 19, she 18, and they had come from Somalia. He had worked in Libya for some time and she was pregnant. It was July. It could be that she has given birth in the meantime. It was July, though, and she was pregnant, in that tent, in that sand. He was 19 and had already made a career for himself as a worker in Libya. These sorts of people, these sorts of families deserve a second chance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the light of this, it is shameful to see that the Member States of the EU are looking away and doing nothing, and yet we had all the ambassadors at the table in the Tunisian capital at the time. Commissioner, you have our support. We will all address this directly with our own Member States, but I find it unfortunate that I am not allowed to ask for the Polish Presidency’s response.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Tunisian people have shown tremendous generosity towards thousands of people who have fled Libya. As you said, humanitarian aid and technical assistance on the part of the European Union have not been lacking. Today, approximately 5 000 people are eligible for refugee status. Yes, Mr Tannock, they are Erythreans, Ethiopians, Somalis, Sudanese, and you know only too well that they cannot return to their countries. They are living in appalling conditions in the middle of the desert. I have seen it with my own eyes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has examined 2 500 applications on the basis of promises of resettlement. The United States has pledged 1 500 places and Norway has pledged approximately 400 places, which is more than the entire effort of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, only seven have accepted refugees, including your country, Commissioner, Sweden, which has accepted almost 200. The rest, France and Great Britain, although parties to the Libyan conflict, have categorically rejected all applications from refugees. I find this debate unacceptable. As far as I am concerned, we could make a minimum effort to show generosity and I am prepared to join my fellow Members in appealing to those countries that refuse to lend a helping hand.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, it is high time that we prioritised and enforced the principle of regional reception of refugees instead of constantly allowing more people without any prospect of work, and therefore of any kind of integration, to enter Europe. The vast majority of all those people from North Africa who want to come to Europe are, in fact, not refugees but economic fortune seekers, who usually pay very large sums of money to traffickers to bring them into Europe. Let us not be naïve, then, because many of these people are anything but poor souls and anything but refugees. On the contrary, they are the very people who are most needed for the reconstruction of their own countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There appears to be something seriously wrong with this whole so-called Arab Spring. Because many North Africans seem to have less confidence in their new leaders than we in the European Union do. How else can you explain the persistent flow of immigrants towards Lampedusa and Europe, Ms Malmström? We must, therefore, make it clear that Europe will only be able to support the new regimes in North Africa, including Tunisia, if that immigration flow finally comes to an end.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I would just like to check with Mr Claeys whether or not he is aware that the refugees who are the topic of today’s debate have all undergone UNHCR screening in the refugee camps in Tunisia and have all been granted the status of political refugees?

      <p sl="nl">Ms Sargentini, we know very well that the vast majority of these people are not political refugees. They want to emigrate for reasons other than political persecution at home. There are some major problems there, I would not want to deny that, of course, but I believe that it is our duty and our job to ensure that, from Europe, we send out every possible signal to those countries to improve the situation on the ground, instead of always just giving people the status of political refugee that clashes with reality. Because, if we were to follow your logic to its natural conclusion, we would actually have to resettle in Europe the entire populations of those countries. That, of course, is absolutely impossible.</p>

They are not your so-called economic migrants. This is a very specific population.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Ms Vergiat, I can only reiterate what I said earlier on. We will, in my opinion, be making problems here in Europe increasingly bigger if we keep bringing more of these people here, instead of allowing them to receive relief in their own region. This is a totally different approach to that currently practised in Europe. This is a fact. We have to start viewing things from a totally different angle, because every person who comes here as part of a resettlement programme, or with the status of political refugee, creates new immigration, a new stream of so-called political refugees.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, I had the privilege of heading the delegation which we are referring to, to Shousha Camp. Firstly, we have to keep in mind that of the roughly three quarters of a million people who fled Libya towards the Tunisian border, all that remains is around 60-70,000 Libyans who are being hosted by Tunisian families, and some 4-5,000 refugees – and I repeat, refugees as opposed to economic migrants – who are still staying at Shousha Camp.</p>
      <p sl="mt">We spent a day at Shousha Camp. We could see for ourselves the difficult conditions in which these refugees live: desert conditions – we were walking in the sand – in a temperature that hovers around the 50° mark, sandstorms which prevent you from leaving the camp or even opening your eyes. Our consolation was that we were there for just one day. But those 4,000 refugees were stuck there, and have been stuck there since June. Therefore we must try and come up with a solution.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I would like to acknowledge the work being done by the UNHCR and other international organisations working there. I would also like to acknowledge the huge financial help being given by the European Union. However, I must say, Commissioner, that although the EU is doing a lot, financially, the aid is not at all visible. The only flags you see are UNHCR ones. You do not see any symbols or logos belonging to the European Union, even though we are contributing millions.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Now: where shall the refugees go? We cannot send them back to their country. We cannot leave them at Shousha Camp. They could go back to Libya. My hope is that the situation in Libya has changed. Perhaps it will become attractive to immigrants. Perhaps it will not start turning people away, and perhaps people will not start fleeing Libya. But the situation is still in a state of flux and until this changes, it is up to us to intervene. Yes, Europe and other developed nations must take on this task. Other countries which are lending a hand – like the United States – should make us feel ashamed of ourselves because compared to them we are not doing enough.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Solidarity towards Tunisia and the refugees is important. It is important because even if we do not help them, they will still come to Europe. They will get on a boat and risk their lives. But there are more dignified alternatives.</p>

    <intervention id="3-447-000" speaker_id="96952" name="Sylvie GUILLAUME" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" nationality="France" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to welcome the openness that the government and people of Tunisia have shown over recent months to tens of thousands of refugees, even though the country was in the midst of a revolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add that it is very important for our Parliament to celebrate the tremendous change that has taken place in Tunisia more visibly. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say how much I hope that next month’s elections are a huge democratic and popular success.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to come back to the question of the refugees currently in Tunisian territory. My fellow Members in other groups and I went there in July, as you know. We went to the Shousha camp, on the border with Libya. It is a place where almost 20 000 people a day found refuge at the height of the crisis. Their living conditions were extremely difficult.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the evacuations you mentioned, Commissioner, in the countries of origin more than 5 000 people, who have indisputably been given the status of ‘refugee’ by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), are still blocked in camps like the Shousha camp. They have no prospects of returning to their homes in countries ravaged by persecution, war, famine and violence, if their country still exists that is. However, they cannot find solutions in other countries either, because the majority of Member States of the European Union turn a blind eye and a deaf ear when it comes to strengthening resettlement schemes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all have roughly the same figures and the same sources: for 2 400 people, whose resettlement was validated in mid-September, only 650 places were pledged, fewer than half in the Member States. Ultimately, slightly fewer than 200 refugees were resettled elsewhere. We must, of course, congratulate the Member States that made pledges, and Norway too. Many Member States, however – and not insignificant ones in terms of size and power – did not make a single pledge to resettle these refugees from Libya. Not a single one. They argue that they are already very active in the current resettlement process. They say they are taking action as and when the need arises. If only that were true, which it is not. There is therefore every reason to be extremely angry at such cynicism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the lack of response and of any prospects for resettlement has direct and dramatic consequence. With no hope of returning to their homes, these refugees are driven into the arms of smugglers to take to the seas and to go for broke, at risk of their lives. Therefore, the question that needs to be asked is very simple: how many lives must be lost at sea before the Member States finally react?</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention, which you alluded to earlier, Commissioner, many of us believe that the Member States of the European Union have a special responsibility towards these refugees. They must pledge places for resettlement and they must pledge them quickly. You can be sure of our support to exert the necessary pressure.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the title of this debate, ‘EU support to refugees in Tunisia’, may, in fact, mislead those who are not aware of the reality of what we are talking about. I would like to thank the Commissioner for having presented data here on the aid which it has been possible to provide, but please allow me, as a rapporteur to Parliament for refugees, to express my indignation – and I know that the Commissioner will take the same view – at learning that not even people dying at the gates of Europe has compelled the Council to conclude the codecision that we adopted two years ago in Parliament. Not even people dying at the gates of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At this point I would also like to address the Council, but I cannot, because the Council did not even come to this debate. It is remarkable that among the promises of the Member States on the resettlement of refugees, Europe will allow the resettlement of perhaps 600 refugees, while the US will resettle more than double that, and Canada and Australia will resettle almost as many. Yet Canada and Australia do not share, as we do, the same region, neighbourhood and future as these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I will finish merely by saying this: I realise that the Commissioner wants to be diplomatic by saying that the codecision procedure is blocked. However, the blame for the codecision procedure being blocked is not equally shared. When there was the problem of delegated acts, the Commission and the Council did not want them and submitted a proposal to us: within a fortnight – two weeks – we in Parliament had a counter-proposal without delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have been waiting for a response from the Council and the Commission for four months. Parliament has been doing its job and it is down to them to resolve this problem, but the fact is that the problem lies in the Council’s failure to attend, and I would prefer it if the Commissioner tried to be fairer in her assessment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we have all heard about the shameful situation in the refugee camps of Tunisia, and I agree with much of what has been said by my fellow Members who have just spoken.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Rather than talking about this in particular, I would like to touch on another situation which often goes unmentioned, namely that of the people who have been received into the homes of families in Tunisia. This is a situation which should make us feel even more ashamed, as we see that in a situation of crisis Tunisia has been able to show solidarity, while Europe has not, even though it is not in the process of making the transition to democracy. It has not been able to show solidarity, and it has been unable to take in refugees.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that it is indeed shameful that we can count the refugees that have been received into Europe in the mere hundreds. Many of these people, contrary to what has been said, cannot return to their homes. There are also children who have been enrolled in state schools, a situation that has implications for infrastructure and for their being hosted in these countries. This is why, Commissioner, I am very touched by the appeal that you have made, and I do not mean that in an ironic way. I am serious, but please tell me: is the Commission serious? Is Europe serious? What can it do? How can Europe sleep easily when it has this double standard? We are all too quick to repatriate and too slow to help, Commissioner. This cannot go on.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, we support your efforts, of that you may rest assured. Every time we have discussed such issues under similar circumstances, I think that Parliament has always been clearly and robustly supportive of you, of the Commission and of the initiatives being taken.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I would remind you, as my colleagues mentioned, that a short while ago – three or four plenaries ago, if I remember correctly – we debated the question of the resettlement of refugees and pointed out that, even though we did not have the emergency situation in ‘our neighbourhood’ when we considered this issue and negotiated it the first time, we felt that this mechanism was now necessary. Today, several months after that debate, here we are again, and you personally are telling us – and we all agree – that the refugee resettlement programme has not been completed and its application has not yet started and that we are confined to efforts being made by individual Member States. Therefore, apart from the fact that we all agree that we support your efforts, I think that we also agree that Europe today is being called upon to manage caravans of refugees at what is obviously a bad time, a bad ‘momentum’ for it, because we do not have all the tools at our disposal that are needed in order to manage this crisis adequately.</p>
      <p sl="el">My colleagues referred to Shousha and I too am in receipt of the information from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, according to which approximately four thousand people are crowded there, with about another 1 600 in host countries. At the same time, the numbers for resettlement – as you too have said – are very low in comparison with current needs and, according to the High Commissioner, only 14% of cases have progressed in terms of resettlement needs.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, without doubt, the communications and press releases from the Commission on economic aid to Tunisia are necessary and important. However, at this critical time, Europe must take proactive decisions, with equal burden-sharing and solidarity, if we want, above all, to be at one with our conscience and to be proud of the Europe of values that we all espouse.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that the most important thing here is to help Tunisia, given the difficult situation it is now in, until its democracy is more established.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that the major effort Tunisia has made to receive all those refugees from the Libyan war could destabilise – and is already destabilising – an entire region, considering the remaining 5 000 people who have come from war-torn Libya.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is a disgrace to us all that this is still happening. It is not as if Europe has done nothing. It is true that, at the most critical point, the refugees numbered up to 700 000, and that Europe has helped to mobilise its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it cannot be denied that something has gone wrong. If we are proposing to establish a mobility partnership with these Southern Mediterranean countries while, at the same time, amending the Schengen Agreement, what is the real message we are sending out? Indeed, what message are we sending out to Member States?</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, please do what we asked of Mr Barroso this morning: take action. I urge you to get properly involved in this issue, because at the end of the day, 5 000 people who need to improve their quality of life and resolve their living situation is not such a high number for the EU. Therefore, try to establish a more EU-centred policy; give more power to the European Asylum Support Office in Malta, and resolve all those disputes that are still outstanding and which the Polish Presidency wants to pursue.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, however, we must help Tunisia on this issue, which is not such a difficult task. Try to create a truly European policy. Stop hiding behind the Member States, because there must be some reason why we are incapable of solving a problem such as this. There is more to this than meets the eye.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, how much longer are we going to ask Tunisians indirectly to bear the dramatic consequences of our poor management of aid to the refugees?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The solidarity shown by Tunisian society is crumbling. We can no longer remain indifferent to the health situation and the new outbreaks of diseases in the camps. It has to be recognised that we, the European Union, have failed on several points: an inhumane migration policy; shameful humanitarian aid measures to tackle the huge needs on the ground; a lack of European solidarity, calling into question the very foundations of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How do we, as European defenders of human rights, see ourselves? What support is the European Union talking about when it addresses people who have, today, effected their democratic revolution? We have the resources to help these refugees but, if there is no political will or tangible force, the Mediterranean will remain a cemetery.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is this acceptable? Can we continue in this way? We must reconsider the issue of the refugees and migration on the basis of a human rights approach taking into account the new political situations. The security approach and the ‘dusting’ carried out by the Frontex Agency are no match for our high standards and values. In the short, medium and long term, the financial assistance given by the European Union must be directed at strengthening the capacities of civil society in Tunisia, in particular, and in the countries of the south more generally.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that just today that this Parliament has approved an amending budget providing more specific resources for funds to assist refugees, and this is a measure of the interest that Parliament has in an issue of such complexity and delicacy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The wind of freedom of the Arab Spring is still blowing. More than 20 years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the two Germanies were reconciled and reunited, now the Mediterranean is also no longer a frontier with respect to what unites the people of North Africa, in particular, with the people of South Africa.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need these readmission agreements and, Commissioner, above all conclusion of the bilateral agreements with Tunisia, with Libya and with Egypt which we have discussed and on which you have worked so many times with great commitment, although once or twice we were probably unlucky. The free elections that will take place in October are a strong sign of this energetic movement towards the achievement of fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">A serious, concrete and credible measure in the context of good neighbourly relations with Tunisia needs to be put in place. At the same time, and I am referring to what the Commissioner said, on the subject of solidarity, only eight states have signalled their willingness to accept resettlement. This is too few, just as the willingness of the same states to help with the serious problems that Lampedusa and Pantelleria continue to suffer is also inadequate in my opinion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have been to Pantelleria and Lampedusa. The migrants who were not refugees were migrants who destroyed the two buildings in which they were housed because they were supposed to be being repatriated. So, we must distinguish economic migrants from refugees and safeguard fundamental rights, bearing in mind that in the Mediterranean the European Union must take on a leading role and that this has not hitherto been the case.</p>

In fact, the European Union has failed to find a way to tackle the exodus triggered by the instability in Tunisia and the war in Libya. The repatriation agreement is not a viable solution, especially given the tragedy involving thousands of refugees at the border between Tunisia and Libya.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union has failed to keep its commitment to assist refugees on Tunisian territory and is unable to manage the crisis on its own territory either. I condemn this lack of solidarity and involvement and I appeal to the Commission and Council to take urgent action to resolve the crisis involving North African refugees.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, there is an urgent need for food aid for refugees arriving in Tunisia. This situation is also compounded by the threat facing the aid distribution organisations of the food stocks running out. I think that the EU needs to assess the situation and the humanitarian aid which still needs to be given to the Tunisian authorities to avert a humanitarian disaster in the region. I also believe that Europe, as a partner in the Union for the Mediterranean, must be involved more via its neighbourhood policy mechanisms to avoid the possibility of the shortage of food being used as a weapon and to tighten food security in the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for this very important debate. Resettlement is of course an extremely important life-saving measure for the most vulnerable people, but it is also a way to show solidarity. We have all rejoiced at events as the people of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt have risen to throw out their dictators and call for freedom and democracy. In the war in Libya, trying to throw out Gaddafi and his regime, we have all supported it and do support it. It has led to a lot of refugees. Many of these people have gone to Libya. Many of these people have been able to return to their home, their country of origin, with help from the European Union, we must remember that. The Tunisian authorities have also done formidable work to ease the situation. Some people might still be able to go home and some, as was said, could maybe go back to Libya when the situation becomes a bit more stable, but there are people who cannot return.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have also been to the camp you referred to in Tunisia and I saw people from Eritrea, from Somalia, looking at their fellow refugees in the neighbouring tents, disappearing one after another, being sent home or somewhere else, asking, ‘Why? What will happen to me?’ They cannot go home, they have no state to go to because that state is a failed state, or they are persecuted. We must help these people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States have done a lot. Some have offered resettlement. Some have offered more, and that is still to be processed, and I want to thank these Member States. I think we should also thank the US, Australia and Canada, because they have taken a lot but, dear friends, it is our neighbourhood. We are the European neighbours of these countries. We could do much more and I hope that we can after this come together even more, ask Member States to do more, to take responsibility. We are certainly willing on the Commission side to do our part. We have called for pledging meetings. We have asked the Member States, we have put resources at our disposal, we are even offering transport support for these people to come to the European Union, but Member States must also now live up to their promises and their nice words about solidarity.</p>
